Comment\r\nUsername: @Chimpufernandez\r\n> HTTPS filtering for this app is already enabled. App may not show the ad immediately upon opening. In my case after minimising it & using any other app for 30 secs and then maximising the Terabox app again will show the ad.\r\n> Updating your filters seems to remove the ad maybe once but when the app is opened again after closing (using greenify) you can see the ad after a few seconds.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/pw7zFpO.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 12\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.11+(54)\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (18), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent (), <br>Hide your IP address (209.141.53.254)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://dns.adguard-dns.com`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt, DnsUserRules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>EasyList, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nCustom filters: | https://github.com/reek/anti-adblock-killer/blob/master/anti-adblock-killer-filters.txt,<br>https://dblmobile.oisd.nl/,<br>https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/44fb408f183ccb3ee6c27a98a4386973e22cc40b/EnglishFilter/sections/antiadblock.txt\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Bitdefender Mobile Security ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146643/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1489691743","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146643#issuecomment-1489691743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146643","id":1489691743,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85YyuRf","user":{"login":"ChimpuFernandez","id":52345784,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzQ1Nzg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52345784?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChimpuFernandez","html_url":"https://github.com/ChimpuFernandez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChimpuFernandez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChimpuFernandez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChimpuFernandez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChimpuFernandez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChimpuFernandez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChimpuFernandez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChimpuFernandez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChimpuFernandez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChimpuFernandez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-30T04:57:22Z","updated_at":"2023-03-30T04:57:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Alex-302 where art thou ?\r\n3 days & no reply or solution alex.....\r\nAd is still there....\r\n\r\nAwaiting for your solution !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1489691743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-30T04:57:23Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
