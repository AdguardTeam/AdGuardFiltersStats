Яндекса, особенно в Яндекс.Телепрограмме. В последнее время она стала особенно назойливой, были случаи появления даже всплывающих окон. Проблема сохраняется во всёх трёх браузерах, установленных на телефоне ( Яндекс, Google Chrome и Opera). У меня также установлено, помимо Adguard Content Blocker,  приложение Adguard,  но проблему это не решает. Хотя, может быть, дело в том, что я не включаю в приложении Adguard HTTPS-фильтрацию трафика, т.к. считаю  эту настройку небезопасной.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot

Яндекса, особенно в Яндекс.Телепрограмме. В последнее время она стала особенно назойливой, были случаи появления даже всплывающих окон. Проблема сохраняется во всёх трёх браузерах, установленных на телефоне ( Яндекс, Google Chrome и Opera). У меня также установлено, помимо Adguard Content Blocker,  приложение Adguard,  но проблему это не решает. Хотя, может быть, дело в том, что я не включаю в приложении Adguard HTTPS-фильтрацию трафика, т.к. считаю  эту настройку небезопасной.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/7oqf63d6j2osocgg8cskcog8oo04ocror6z6km88go.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Content Blocker v2.7.3\r\nSystem version: | Android 11\r\nBrowser: | Яндекс Браузер\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>ABPindo, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>EasyList China, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>Liste FR, <br/>ROList, <br/>Greek AdBlock Filter, <br/>Polish GDPR-Cookies Filters, <br/>Estonian List, <br/>List-KR, <br/>YousList, <br/>ABPVN List</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/176203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/176203/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-07T08:18:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
