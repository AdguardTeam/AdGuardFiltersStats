El bloqueador de AdGuard debe estar realizando algún tipo de bloqueo en el acceso porque si se deshabilita por completo no hace este problema, pero si se deja la app y aun desactivando la función de filtrado en este sitio web, sigue funcionando incorrectamente. Quiero creer que es por el DNS, pero quiero saber cómo configurarlo correctamente.
