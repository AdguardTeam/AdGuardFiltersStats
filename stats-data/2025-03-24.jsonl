On the mobile page, this bar is at the top. \nHere is the link to the page from which I took the second screenshot:\n`https://www.mynet.com/magazin/ekrem-imamoglu-paylasimi-sonrasi-takipci-sayisi-dustu-takipten-cikanlar-130100524081`\n\nBy the way, I can't directly report an issue for this page, neither through the mobile program nor through the extension. It gives an error that the issue could not be created.\n\n<details><summary>Details</summary>\n<p>\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ca89b80-56d1-4996-a773-0ac8d044934c)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d1740b8-ac81-4e61-8f53-e07bbdee71e8)\n\n</p>\n</details> \n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2748579179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-24T15:44:11Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

The link above brings you to a specific example, but it is relevant to all website articles. While the auto-playing video is not an advertisement, it is also not relevant in anyway to article contents. I suggest blocking these under the \"AdGuard Annoyances\" filter as these autoplaying videos are distracting and manually blocking them does not create any site blockage in my experience.\n\nBlocking arstechnica.com##.cne-interlude-container should block this annoyance from displaying.\n\n2.

The link above brings you to a specific example, but it is relevant to all website articles. While the auto-playing video is not an advertisement, it is also not relevant in anyway to article contents. I suggest blocking these under the \"AdGuard Annoyances\" filter as these autoplaying videos are distracting and manually blocking them does not create any site blockage in my experience.\n\nBlocking arstechnica.com##.cne-interlude-container should block this annoyance from displaying.\n\n2.

The link above brings you to a specific example, but it is relevant to all website articles. While the auto-playing video is not an advertisement, it is also not relevant in anyway to article contents. I suggest blocking these under the \"AdGuard Annoyances\" filter as these autoplaying videos are distracting and manually blocking them does not create any site blockage in my experience.\n\nBlocking arstechnica.com##.cne-interlude-container should block this annoyance from displaying.\n\n2.

The link above brings you to a specific example, but it is relevant to all website articles. While the auto-playing video is not an advertisement, it is also not relevant in anyway to article contents. I suggest blocking these under the \"AdGuard Annoyances\" filter as these autoplaying videos are distracting and manually blocking them does not create any site blockage in my experience.\n\nBlocking arstechnica.com##.cne-interlude-container should block this annoyance from displaying.\n\n2.
