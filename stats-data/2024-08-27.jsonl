This file contains temporary duplicate fixes for popular sites, added to another filters.\r\n+! The necessity for this file arises from the fact that static filters in the Mv3 extension are only updated\r\n+! when the extension itself is updated. Due to this, the update process can be delayed for users, potentially\r\n+! leaving them vulnerable to unresolved issues. This file serves as a quick-response solution, ensuring that\r\n+! AdGuard Mv3 extension users experience minimal disruption while awaiting updates of the extension with static filters.\r\n+!\r\n+! Key points:\r\n+! - Purpose: This file used to store temporary rules to address issues, regardless of which filter is\r\n+!   causing the problem or if ads are being missed on popular sites (e.g., YouTube).\r\n+! - Temporary: All rules added to this file are temporary and must be removed after 14 days from the date of their addition.\r\n+! - Flexibility: Rules can be added without restrictions
