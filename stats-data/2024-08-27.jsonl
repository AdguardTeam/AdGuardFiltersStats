This file contains temporary duplicate fixes for popular sites, added to another filters.\r\n+! The necessity for this file arises from the fact that static filters in the Mv3 extension are only updated\r\n+! when the extension itself is updated. Due to this, the update process can be delayed for users, potentially\r\n+! leaving them vulnerable to unresolved issues. This file serves as a quick-response solution, ensuring that\r\n+! AdGuard Mv3 extension users experience minimal disruption while awaiting updates of the extension with static filters.\r\n+!\r\n+! Key points:\r\n+! - Purpose: This file used to store temporary rules to address issues, regardless of which filter is\r\n+!   causing the problem or if ads are being missed on popular sites (e.g., YouTube).\r\n+! - Temporary: All rules added to this file are temporary and must be removed after 14 days from the date of their addition.\r\n+! - Flexibility: Rules can be added without restrictions

The same rule can be parsed by Adguard for Mac but it has the same problem.\r\n> \r\n> BTW. Adguard for Mac does not highlight syntax error if there's an error in user rules. Is there a way for Adguard to highlight errors when it detects any syntax issue?\r\n> \r\n> Thanks\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/9la05kgct3c44k84w40ogccos444g84du0zkawxkdk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/7j8fy4nli84ko0gosk8g044sw8o0oco4yfccw6y5sc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.15.1.1731 release\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nTracking protection options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2312930306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-27T15:48:51Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
