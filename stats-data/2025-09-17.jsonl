I have a system that crawls top domains and collects browser API usage data. Building on prior research that measures entropy exposed by browser APIs, the system estimates the entropy gathered by each script. Using this approach, I got an extensive list of scripts that are suspicious for browser fingerprinting, like scripts I reported `https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20author%3Ajsu6`. I wonder if there is any way I can contribute this list to AdgraudTeam without reporting them individually? I am glad to answer any questions related to it. \n\nAlso, for the scripts I reported `https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20author%3Ajsu6`, I saw some of them are still open. Is there any reason why they are still open rather than closed as false positives or resolved?\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nNA\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3302371866","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039#issuecomment-3302371866","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039","id":3302371866,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87E1jIa","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-17T10:33:35Z","updated_at":"2025-09-17T10:33:35Z","body":"I think manual checking is necessary, because not all users will realize that the cause of the malfunction is the ad blocker.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3302371866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-09-17T10:33:36Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Trying to watch Hulu on Safari with the AdGuard for Safari extension active, however there are still ads popping up at the start of each new episode. I also notice the runtime for these episodes are longer and the ads are a part of the runtime. I have the AdGuard extension installed on Google Chrome as well with the same exact settings and Hulu works perfectly fine over there. Normal episode runtime and all ads are blocked without issues.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/wd8baevxfjkswk80oo400w0s0k8w08ilcz7v1zf3co.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.22\r\nSystem version: | `MacOS Sequoia 15.5`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nOther extensions used: | `Surfshark, PayPal Honey, Teleparty`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/212218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/212218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3302614564","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/212218#issuecomment-3302614564","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/212218","id":3302614564,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87E2eYk","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-17T11:46:25Z","updated_at":"2025-09-17T11:46:25Z","body":"@BlazDT I mean removing when unassignment.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3302614564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-09-17T11:46:26Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [https://www.golem.de/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.golem.de%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> golem.de was recently updated with what seem to be inline scripts or classes that update somehow to circumvent ad blocking. I have tried to specifically remove the ad parts and create individual rules, but this only works in the current session. As soon as the page is reloaded it goes back to ad-mania.

( [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing#264](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing/issues/264) )\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Please check that there no another web browser extension that has adblocking feature is enabled on your web browser. It can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> Saving memory feature of your web browser or sleep feature of your operating system can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n> In this case, please re-enable AdGuard's filtering by toggling the protection toggle.\n> Following the instructions can be needed.\n\n### The instructions\n1. Force to update the filters by clicking the reload button in AdGuard Browser Extension/AdGuard mobile or update tray menu in your system tray. [^2]\n2. Reload the YouTube webpage without cache by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> [^3].\n3. Clear cache, cookies and site data of your web browser.\n4. Re-open your web browser completely (checking your system monitor[^4] will be better).\n\n[^1]: https://gitlab.com/adblockinc/ext/adblockplus/adblockplusui/-/issues/1576\n[^2]: [AdGuard for Windows](https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-windows/overview/#tray-menu); [AdGuard for Mac](https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-mac/overview/#updates-check); \n[^3]: On macOS, <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>\n[^4]: Task Manager on Windows, System Monitor on GNOME Shell, KDE System Guard on KDE Plasma or Activity Monitor on macOS. \n\n\nPrevious issue https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198973","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/203236/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/203236/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3303802174","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/203236#issuecomment-3303802174","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/203236","id":3303802174,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87E7AU-","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-17T16:43:31Z","updated_at":"2025-09-17T16:43:31Z","body":"Can't reproduce the last two.

I have a system that crawls top domains and collects browser API usage data. Building on prior research that measures entropy exposed by browser APIs, the system estimates the entropy gathered by each script. Using this approach, I got an extensive list of scripts that are suspicious for browser fingerprinting, like scripts I reported `https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20author%3Ajsu6`. I wonder if there is any way I can contribute this list to AdgraudTeam without reporting them individually? I am glad to answer any questions related to it. \n\nAlso, for the scripts I reported `https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20author%3Ajsu6`, I saw some of them are still open. Is there any reason why they are still open rather than closed as false positives or resolved?\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nNA\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3303979251","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039#issuecomment-3303979251","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039","id":3303979251,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87E7rjz","user":{"login":"jsu6","id":61016522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDE2NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61016522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6","html_url":"https://github.com/jsu6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-17T17:41:08Z","updated_at":"2025-09-17T17:41:08Z","body":"I agree that manual checking is necessary.

I have a system that crawls top domains and collects browser API usage data. Building on prior research that measures entropy exposed by browser APIs, the system estimates the entropy gathered by each script. Using this approach, I got an extensive list of scripts that are suspicious for browser fingerprinting, like scripts I reported `https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20author%3Ajsu6`. I wonder if there is any way I can contribute this list to AdgraudTeam without reporting them individually? I am glad to answer any questions related to it. \n\nAlso, for the scripts I reported `https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20author%3Ajsu6`, I saw some of them are still open. Is there any reason why they are still open rather than closed as false positives or resolved?\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nNA\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3303979251","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039#issuecomment-3303979251","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039","id":3303979251,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87E7rjz","user":{"login":"jsu6","id":61016522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDE2NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61016522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6","html_url":"https://github.com/jsu6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-17T17:41:08Z","updated_at":"2025-09-17T17:41:08Z","body":"I agree that manual checking is necessary.

I just want to speed up the reporting process for a large number of suspicious scripts.

I have a system that crawls top domains and collects browser API usage data. Building on prior research that measures entropy exposed by browser APIs, the system estimates the entropy gathered by each script. Using this approach, I got an extensive list of scripts that are suspicious for browser fingerprinting, like scripts I reported `https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20author%3Ajsu6`. I wonder if there is any way I can contribute this list to AdgraudTeam without reporting them individually? I am glad to answer any questions related to it. \n\nAlso, for the scripts I reported `https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20author%3Ajsu6`, I saw some of them are still open. Is there any reason why they are still open rather than closed as false positives or resolved?\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nNA\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3303979251","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039#issuecomment-3303979251","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039","id":3303979251,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87E7rjz","user":{"login":"jsu6","id":61016522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDE2NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61016522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6","html_url":"https://github.com/jsu6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsu6/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-17T17:41:08Z","updated_at":"2025-09-17T17:41:08Z","body":"I agree that manual checking is necessary.

I just want to speed up the reporting process for a large number of suspicious scripts.
