let's try it.\r\nI will modify it to `(?:pv-cdn\\.net|\\/dm\\/).*\\.mpd`, just in case if there wouldn't be `/dm/` but still `aiv-cdn.net` was used, though it will not fix ads if there will be not `/dm/` and `aiv-cdn.net`. If there will be new reports about not blocked ads then we can try to modify it again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2063276765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-18T08:08:57Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
