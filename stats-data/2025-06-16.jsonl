Recently, I created a website for my client based on WordPress (https://rentalking.pl/). Unfortunately, since then, my website has been loading very slowly for all visitors, and the error console points to some issue with local.adguard.org.\r\n> \r\n> I thought the problem might be caused by a script on the site, so I completely removed it and reinstalled it, but unfortunately, the issue persists. It seems as if AdGuard is blocking some components of my site at the domain level, causing them to load very slowly.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jhhyva918v4g8o0oc4g884ok0so40gkj9zb8fz6s3c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6jo0da16cnksskgkcwgss4s4cw4kgo8dhb0dul6zwo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.16.4.1870 release\r\nSystem version: | MacOS 15.5 (kompilacja 24F74)\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Fonts Ninja, Font Finder\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&channel=release&clid=RJPafT--cG4CAF--njDuHY&custom_filters=&dns.bootstraps=&dns.custom_filters=&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_enabled=false&dns.fallbacks=&dns.filters=1&dns.servers=System&dns.timeout=2000&extensions=AdGuard+Extra+%28script%3B+url%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=2.3.6.9.16.105.216.224.238&product_type=Mac&product_version=2.16.4.1870+release&referrer=&scheme_version=3&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_third_party_auth=false&stealth.block_trackers=true&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=false&stealth.dpi=false&stealth.enabled=false&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.java=true&stealth.location=true&stealth.push=true&stealth.strip_url=false&stealth.third_party_cookies=180&stealth.webrtc=false&stealth.x_client=true&system_version=MacOS+15.5+%28kompilacja+24F74%29&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Macintosh%3B+Intel+Mac+OS+X+10_15_7%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F137.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&utm_campaign=report&utm_medium=assistant&utm_source=mac)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207639/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-16T08:22:40Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
