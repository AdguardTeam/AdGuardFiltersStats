Recently, I created a website for my client based on WordPress (https://rentalking.pl/). Unfortunately, since then, my website has been loading very slowly for all visitors, and the error console points to some issue with local.adguard.org.\r\n> \r\n> I thought the problem might be caused by a script on the site, so I completely removed it and reinstalled it, but unfortunately, the issue persists. It seems as if AdGuard is blocking some components of my site at the domain level, causing them to load very slowly.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jhhyva918v4g8o0oc4g884ok0so40gkj9zb8fz6s3c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6jo0da16cnksskgkcwgss4s4cw4kgo8dhb0dul6zwo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.16.4.1870 release\r\nSystem version: | MacOS 15.5 (kompilacja 24F74)\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Fonts Ninja, Font Finder\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&channel=release&clid=RJPafT--cG4CAF--njDuHY&custom_filters=&dns.bootstraps=&dns.custom_filters=&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_enabled=false&dns.fallbacks=&dns.filters=1&dns.servers=System&dns.timeout=2000&extensions=AdGuard+Extra+%28script%3B+url%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=2.3.6.9.16.105.216.224.238&product_type=Mac&product_version=2.16.4.1870+release&referrer=&scheme_version=3&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_third_party_auth=false&stealth.block_trackers=true&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=false&stealth.dpi=false&stealth.enabled=false&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.java=true&stealth.location=true&stealth.push=true&stealth.strip_url=false&stealth.third_party_cookies=180&stealth.webrtc=false&stealth.x_client=true&system_version=MacOS+15.5+%28kompilacja+24F74%29&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Macintosh%3B+Intel+Mac+OS+X+10_15_7%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F137.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&utm_campaign=report&utm_medium=assistant&utm_source=mac)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207639/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-16T08:22:40Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Recently, I created a website for my client based on WordPress (https://rentalking.pl/). Unfortunately, since then, my website has been loading very slowly for all visitors, and the error console points to some issue with local.adguard.org.\r\n> \r\n> I thought the problem might be caused by a script on the site, so I completely removed it and reinstalled it, but unfortunately, the issue persists. It seems as if AdGuard is blocking some components of my site at the domain level, causing them to load very slowly.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jhhyva918v4g8o0oc4g884ok0so40gkj9zb8fz6s3c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6jo0da16cnksskgkcwgss4s4cw4kgo8dhb0dul6zwo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.16.4.1870 release\r\nSystem version: | MacOS 15.5 (kompilacja 24F74)\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Fonts Ninja, Font Finder\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&channel=release&clid=RJPafT--cG4CAF--njDuHY&custom_filters=&dns.bootstraps=&dns.custom_filters=&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_enabled=false&dns.fallbacks=&dns.filters=1&dns.servers=System&dns.timeout=2000&extensions=AdGuard+Extra+%28script%3B+url%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=2.3.6.9.16.105.216.224.238&product_type=Mac&product_version=2.16.4.1870+release&referrer=&scheme_version=3&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_third_party_auth=false&stealth.block_trackers=true&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=false&stealth.dpi=false&stealth.enabled=false&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.java=true&stealth.location=true&stealth.push=true&stealth.strip_url=false&stealth.third_party_cookies=180&stealth.webrtc=false&stealth.x_client=true&system_version=MacOS+15.5+%28kompilacja+24F74%29&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Macintosh%3B+Intel+Mac+OS+X+10_15_7%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F137.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&utm_campaign=report&utm_medium=assistant&utm_source=mac)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207639/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2975942828","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207639#issuecomment-2975942828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207639","id":2975942828,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86xYUis","user":{"login":"Gdof9dj","id":216518713,"node_id":"U_kgDODOfQOQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216518713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gdof9dj","html_url":"https://github.com/Gdof9dj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gdof9dj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gdof9dj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gdof9dj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gdof9dj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gdof9dj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gdof9dj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gdof9dj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gdof9dj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gdof9dj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-16T10:12:03Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T10:12:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\nThank you for the information.

Unfortunately, since then, my website has been loading very slowly for all visitors, and the error console points to some issue with local.adguard.org.\r\n> \r\n> I thought the problem might be caused by a script on the site, so I completely removed it and reinstalled it, but unfortunately, the issue persists. It seems as if AdGuard is blocking some components of my site at the domain level, causing them to load very slowly.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jhhyva918v4g8o0oc4g884ok0so40gkj9zb8fz6s3c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6jo0da16cnksskgkcwgss4s4cw4kgo8dhb0dul6zwo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.16.4.1870 release\r\nSystem version: | MacOS 15.5 (kompilacja 24F74)\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Fonts Ninja, Font Finder\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&channel=release&clid=RJPafT--cG4CAF--njDuHY&custom_filters=&dns.bootstraps=&dns.custom_filters=&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_enabled=false&dns.fallbacks=&dns.filters=1&dns.servers=System&dns.timeout=2000&extensions=AdGuard+Extra+%28script%3B+url%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=2.3.6.9.16.105.216.224.238&product_type=Mac&product_version=2.16.4.1870+release&referrer=&scheme_version=3&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_third_party_auth=false&stealth.block_trackers=true&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=false&stealth.dpi=false&stealth.enabled=false&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.java=true&stealth.location=true&stealth.push=true&stealth.strip_url=false&stealth.third_party_cookies=180&stealth.webrtc=false&stealth.x_client=true&system_version=MacOS+15.5+%28kompilacja+24F74%29&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Macintosh%3B+Intel+Mac+OS+X+10_15_7%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F137.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&utm_campaign=report&utm_medium=assistant&utm_source=mac)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207639/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-16T09:52:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Unfortunately, since then, my website has been loading very slowly for all visitors, and the error console points to some issue with local.adguard.org.\r\n> \r\n> I thought the problem might be caused by a script on the site, so I completely removed it and reinstalled it, but unfortunately, the issue persists. It seems as if AdGuard is blocking some components of my site at the domain level, causing them to load very slowly.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jhhyva918v4g8o0oc4g884ok0so40gkj9zb8fz6s3c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6jo0da16cnksskgkcwgss4s4cw4kgo8dhb0dul6zwo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.16.4.1870 release\r\nSystem version: | MacOS 15.5 (kompilacja 24F74)\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Fonts Ninja, Font Finder\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&channel=release&clid=RJPafT--cG4CAF--njDuHY&custom_filters=&dns.bootstraps=&dns.custom_filters=&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_enabled=false&dns.fallbacks=&dns.filters=1&dns.servers=System&dns.timeout=2000&extensions=AdGuard+Extra+%28script%3B+url%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=2.3.6.9.16.105.216.224.238&product_type=Mac&product_version=2.16.4.1870+release&referrer=&scheme_version=3&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_third_party_auth=false&stealth.block_trackers=true&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=false&stealth.dpi=false&stealth.enabled=false&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.java=true&stealth.location=true&stealth.push=true&stealth.strip_url=false&stealth.third_party_cookies=180&stealth.webrtc=false&stealth.x_client=true&system_version=MacOS+15.5+%28kompilacja+24F74%29&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Macintosh%3B+Intel+Mac+OS+X+10_15_7%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F137.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&utm_campaign=report&utm_medium=assistant&utm_source=mac)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207639/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2976026776","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207639#issuecomment-2976026776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207639","id":2976026776,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86xYpCY","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-16T10:34:32Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T10:34:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi!\n\n> Could you please advise me on how to correctly configure the filtering so that the website is not blocked?\n\nIn that case, the filtering log should be opened.

Only when that class is removed or added back to an already hidden ad element.\r\nUsername: `@peace2000`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4h8rhrz5xl6oo040gkssc8ckgkgkgkoyxmtckwwz7k.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tfkgqq9fk9w4wo844s4owsowcs08k8kgw9cvqss4nc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/aoszpmklpc00www48ogw0440cc0kw8cojeldy1mz1c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3vfj3bpl63s48ksw408s04g8gc0cgo4q5lx2f1g5uo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.94 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Adblock List for Finland\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207603/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-16T14:35:07Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [https://m.facebook.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> When scrolling down or up the feed on Facebook mobile page (m.facebook.com), at some point when you have scrolled enough, posts start \"jumping\".\r\n> \r\n> In practice, I get scrolled back to previous post. This doesn't happen on each post, but at some point it starts to happen quite frequently.\r\n> \r\n> This can't be presented via screenshots, but in those screenshots I've already scrolled past the post that has a blonde woman on it and the fishing post is now appearing. From that point, when I scroll forward, I get thrown back so that the fishing post disappears and I see the post that was before the post with a blonde woman.\r\n> \r\n> Looking at the DOM at the same time when scrolling and this issue appears, I see that an ad post that was hid earlier, gets its \"displayed\" class removed from it. And if I scroll to the other direction, it gets added back (and I jump back to my previous location at the feed). I think that Facebook still manipulates those already hidden ad elements, which causes me to jump into wrong place at the Feed.\r\n> \r\n> If I remove those hidden ad posts (the whole node) this issue doesn't appear.\r\n> \r\n> \"displayed\" class already gets removed and added back to regular posts when scrolling up and down but that doesn't cause issues. Only when that class is removed or added back to an already hidden ad element.\r\nUsername: `@peace2000`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4h8rhrz5xl6oo040gkssc8ckgkgkgkoyxmtckwwz7k.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tfkgqq9fk9w4wo844s4owsowcs08k8kgw9cvqss4nc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/aoszpmklpc00www48ogw0440cc0kw8cojeldy1mz1c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3vfj3bpl63s48ksw408s04g8gc0cgo4q5lx2f1g5uo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.94 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Adblock List for Finland\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207603/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2976987717","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207603#issuecomment-2976987717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207603","id":2976987717,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86xcTpF","user":{"login":"peace2000","id":17256841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjU2ODQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17256841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peace2000","html_url":"https://github.com/peace2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peace2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peace2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peace2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peace2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peace2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peace2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peace2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peace2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peace2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-16T14:56:23Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T14:56:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jordansworld I can see this issue on my phone and on PC when I use mobile user agent.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2976987717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-16T14:56:24Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

/>\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6887944-583e-417e-b12e-07689057547b\n\n an issue with [YouTube.com](http://youtube.com/) video ads that appear at the beginning of any video. Please note this is a very recent regression that started on May 27, 2025 and prior to that all video ads were blocked. \n\nThe behaviour is different on iPhone where mobile version of YouTube in Safari is used. In that case all ads are blocked as before.\n\nIn desktop Safari, with latest AdGuard and all most up to date filters, the behaviour is different for logged in case vs viewing without logging in.\n\nIf I don't log in to my account, no video ads are displayed. When clicking on any video, it plays immediately with no spinner and no ads. \n\nIf I do log in, the behaviour changes:\n\nOnce you click on any video, the page loads and video does not play immediately. Initially, spinner is displayed for quite long time and after that an ad is displayed. You have an option to skip the ad and then the video plays normally. \n\nPlease note that Brave Browser with its default ad blocker does not display any ads and videos start immediately. Firefox with uBlock Origin also works as normal.\n\niPad Safari (latest iPadOS, Adguard Pro and filters up to date) also shows the same experience and desktop Safari.\n\nInterestingly engough Brave Browser on iPad does block all ads as before and video startup experience is different. Videos play immediately and no ads are shown.\n\nHere is some relevant systems info:\n\nmacOS 15.5 (24F74), Safari Version 18.5 (20621.2.5.11.8) with AdGuard for Safari Version 1.11.22.\n\niPadOS 18.5 with AdGuard Pro for iOS version 4.5.10 (1029)\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206500/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2978085517","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206500#issuecomment-2978085517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206500","id":2978085517,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86xgfqN","user":{"login":"mario-grgic","id":1044216,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQyMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1044216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic","html_url":"https://github.com/mario-grgic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-16T20:48:24Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T20:48:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Recent filter update has fixed this issue.
