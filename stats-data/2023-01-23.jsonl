Добрый день!

projects (public and private) no longer work as expected. \r\nI found out that Adguard updated the annoyances list with a very strange approach related to one of my projects, the adblock test.\r\nHere is the commit of the change: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/commit/137b1d9410091d0a675b077d02505ab20a7c0b06\r\n\r\nBasically my very simple adblock test https://d3ward.github.io/toolz/adblock.html does a check on the most popular hosts of a couple of categories, this projects works and has helped a lot of users, it works as expected with different DNS solutions, adblock extensions and more. Unfortunately not with Adguard products, though the lists works \r\nIn the past I had a discussion with someone from Adguard team and we agreed that Adguard solutions are different, and somehow the adblock test have false positive because of how Adguard products works, which does not mean that Adguard does not work!\r\nWhen I use the Adguard lists annoyances with solutions like uBlock Origin, the test adblock works as expected and is not \"useless test\".\r\n\r\n1. I don't see why it was necessary to add a statement like \"! useless adblocker test with wrong tests\", it feels disrespectful. In fact, I recommend using Adguard in a separate section of the adblock test.\r\n2. Many users have reported that their Adguard product works even though the tool gives wrong results. So it's just a test. In fact, on a screenshot shared there, it shows how the test fails and Adguard works as expected. https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/138613#issuecomment-1366943050\r\n3. The adblock tool even has a statement saying that some users may have problems, and there is actually a message every time the user does the test \"it is a tool to use as a reference to see how efficient your blocking system is (note that with some DNS and browsers there may be problems)\". I didn't want to be the one to point out which adblockers or DNS have problems (like the Adguard extension), so instead I opened  discussion with the users and explained to them how things works. As far i know , while solutions like uBlock Origin actually block the connections , with Adguard products the requests are empty and this make the test fail .\r\n4. A rule like `$third-party,domain=d3ward.github.io,important` it's kind of too much, it's block every external api call that start from the domain \"d3ward.github.io\" , in practice, my main domain is now considered even more annoying than any other ad provider, tracker or otherwise. The rule it's blocking even a simple Github API call I use on my portfolio ->\r\n<img width=\"577\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39910418/213945378-fe5cd58f-1417-4578-8394-fa4da43ff23a.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to see this resolved and perhaps open a discussion on what solution we can work on. I'm happy to provide any information, how the adblock test works, which rule should be used instead, etc. I'm aware that users are using the adblock test and thinking that Adguard is not working, and this is causing some confusion. I'm actually working on updating the test to be more clear and specific for only a set of adblocker solutions \n\n### Privacy\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/140769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/140769/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1400250607","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/140769#issuecomment-1400250607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/140769","id":1400250607,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85TdiDv","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-23T12:18:03Z","updated_at":"2023-01-23T12:18:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I added that rule because you check domains, which are not used for ads(as sources) and for tracking.\r\n* googleadservices.com - just a clicktrough links (for example, context ads in google search, which blocked by element hiding rules)\r\n* amazon domains - for ads used `c.amazon-adsystem.com` Where are used another domains from the test?\r\n* `analytics.facebook.com` - also is not used for tracking, and now it redirects to https://www.facebook.com/business/help/966883707418907\r\n* `advertising.twitter.com` - same as FB\r\n* also not sure about Pinterest domains\r\n* Yandex - `adsdk.yandex.ru`, `extmaps-api.yandex.net` not used for ads. \r\n\t* `an.yandex.ru` - used for ads\r\n\t* `mc.yandex.ru`, `mc.yandex.com` - analytics\r\n* Xiaomi, Huawei etc. - domains used by mobole devices, and the rules in regular ad blockers are useless.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this test you are forcing the filter developers to block domains that should not be blocked.\r\n\r\nAlso used colors - it the pain for eyes, too contrast.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1400250607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-01-23T12:18:03Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
