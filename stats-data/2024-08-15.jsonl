issue is caused by Adguard on iPhone's inability to handle iframes properly. There is no specific rule in place to hide the ad placeholder. On PC, blocking the script reduces the size to 0, effectively hiding the ad frame. However, on iPhone, the iframe remains visible, which is why it's expected that the ad frame does not disappear.
