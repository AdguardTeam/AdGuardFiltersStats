AdGuard used to block all ads and cancel any attempts of a website to redirect me to another site. HOWEVER, for some reason it’s not doing that anymore!!\r\n> On the website I linked (9anime.to) if I try to click ANYTHING it will redirect me to any number of countless scam websites. It opens up a new browsing window, and takes me to a completely different page/site.\r\n> This hasn’t ever been a problem for me before, because AdGuard wouldn’t allow them to take me anywhere — but all of a sudden AdGuard stopped blocking them!  HELP!!\r\n> \r\n> I’ve spent the last day and a half trying to figure out what can be done. I’ve updated, made sure all filters are active and on, and tried updating the app several different times too. NOTHING works. When I click the spinning arrows in the top right of the screen, eventually (after I wait forever while it says it’s updating) it gives me the error “Filter update error” and stops. I’ve tried four separate times, just sitting here staring at those circling arrows until the error message pops up. I CAN’T GET IT TO WORK.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/ShoZJmt.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.6\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion, <br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>ABPindo, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>EasyList China, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Dutch, <br/>EasyList Germany, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>Liste FR, <br/>ROList, <br/>Icelandic ABP List, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Greek AdBlock Filter, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>Xfiles, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish GDPR-Cookies Filters, <br/>Estonian List, <br/>CJX's Annoyances List, <br/>Polish Social Filters, <br/>List-KR, <br/>xinggsf, <br/>EasyList Spanish, <br/>KAD -
