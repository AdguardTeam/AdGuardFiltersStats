The website appears to have a blurred overlay over it that you can't click or do anything on. I have done testing and confirmed the issue resolves with this list disabled.

Comment\r\nUsername: @petrovadrian\r\n> On my iPad (with iPadOS 17) Adguard stopped blocking some ads. Please note that I already had iOS 17 + Adguard before, and ads were being blocked. This problem started approximately 2 days prior to creating this ticket.\r\n> \r\n> It no longer blocks Reddit \"Promoted\" ads: https://i.imgur.com/dTF5tC3.png\r\n> \r\n> And it fails some adblocker tests: https://i.imgur.com/yFDboYh.png & https://i.imgur.com/yvPnYIf.png\r\n> \r\n> I reinstall the app several times and cleared Safari cookies. I tried different filter configurations (default included) and nothing changed.\r\n> \r\n> Issue doesn't occur on iPhone (iOS 16) with default (Adguard) settings: https://i.imgur.com/oAPRjuF.png\r\n> \r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jbqltoc9usoococogscog8sk4w488ws2ir3hkbk85s.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b8ob71j9xg8cc4kggwgkg0gcw4ck0s4kxarqnx5rzk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/n4khnbg6nn4oo4o00googkg04sk0scqik3cxwcnf48.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.5.0\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS over HTTPS`<br>filters: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3ward/toolz/master/src/d3host.adblock`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental, <br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>ROList, <br/>road-block","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157205/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-31T10:51:41Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Please note that I already had iOS 17 + Adguard before, and ads were being blocked. This problem started approximately 2 days prior to creating this ticket.\r\n> \r\n> It no longer blocks Reddit \"Promoted\" ads: https://i.imgur.com/dTF5tC3.png\r\n> \r\n> And it fails some adblocker tests: https://i.imgur.com/yFDboYh.png & https://i.imgur.com/yvPnYIf.png\r\n> \r\n> I reinstall the app several times and cleared Safari cookies. I tried different filter configurations (default included) and nothing changed.\r\n> \r\n> Issue doesn't occur on iPhone (iOS 16) with default (Adguard) settings: https://i.imgur.com/oAPRjuF.png\r\n> \r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jbqltoc9usoococogscog8sk4w488ws2ir3hkbk85s.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b8ob71j9xg8cc4kggwgkg0gcw4ck0s4kxarqnx5rzk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/n4khnbg6nn4oo4o00googkg04sk0scqik3cxwcnf48.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.5.0\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS over HTTPS`<br>filters: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3ward/toolz/master/src/d3host.adblock`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental, <br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>ROList, <br/>road-block","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157205/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1658104076","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157205#issuecomment-1658104076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157205","id":1658104076,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85i1KkM","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-31T10:32:52Z","updated_at":"2023-07-31T10:32:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@petrovadrian Promoted post must be hidden by `reddit.com,reddittorjg6rue252oqsxryoxengawnmo46qy4kyii5wtqnwfj4ooad.onion##.promotedlink` rule.\r\nPlease export the log after reproducing an issue, and send it to filters@adguard.com + link to the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1658104076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-31T10:32:53Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
