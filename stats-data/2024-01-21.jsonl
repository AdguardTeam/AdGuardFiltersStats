When I try to watch YouTube, I get the \"Ad blockers violate YouTube's Terms of Service\" message. So I added YouTube to the allowed list on AdGuard, however I still get the same message on YouTube, and it won't let me play any videos. As far as I am aware, I don't have anything else actively blocking ads, but I decided to start turning things off to see what it was that was tripping YouTube. Starting with the obvious one, AdGuard itself, and when I turned off AdGuard YouTube worked again. I am trying to figure out why YouTube is still blocking me if I have it on my allow list already.
