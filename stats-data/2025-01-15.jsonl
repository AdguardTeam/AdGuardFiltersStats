website for the first time in a session, the page loads, then immediately reloads a second time. \r\n> This applies to sites on the same domain as well - i.e. if you visit news.yahoo.com, and then visit sports.yahoo.com, the undesired 2nd page load behavior still happens.  Subsequent visits to the same website in the same session do not result in the page being loaded twice.
