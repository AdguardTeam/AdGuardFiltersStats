U don't have this issue?\n> \n> Hey [@jo2dan94](https://github.com/jo2dan94) , I didn't experience any playback issues either on my Onn 4K Plus or my Android phone. I would maybe try clearing your app cache and force stopping the app? I just encountered the new ad domains that you listed today and will have to add them to my blocklist. Appreciate you pointing those out!\n\nSamsung TV must use a different sdk or something I still get ads at beginning and ads in between. As for the buffering problems it's because none of the h264.io domains can be blocked","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3483208129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-11-04T00:35:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

It seems to me the shows I was previously watching happened to fall within the blocking/filtering rules I had setup. After I played around with a bunch of different shows I don't normally watch, I had ads throughout the stream. Each time, the same domain (I believe that contains the ads) popped up in the query log:\n\ncf.amer-free.prd.media.h264.io\n\nThe challenge is that they've stitched the ads into the stream and blocking the domain will affect playback as we've previously found out. I have to try to dig deeper to see what (if anything) might be effective against this. Appreciate you providing some feedback with your streaming experience!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3483422524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-11-04T02:11:01Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

U don't have this issue?\n>>\n>> Hey ***@***.***(https://github.com/jo2dan94) , I didn't experience any playback issues either on my Onn 4K Plus or my Android phone. I would maybe try clearing your app cache and force stopping the app? I just encountered the new ad domains that you listed today and will have to add them to my blocklist. Appreciate you pointing those out!\n>>\n>> —\n>> Reply to this email directly, [view it on GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/215201#issuecomment-3483141826), or [unsubscribe](https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/BV34USUL5EJVXHW6KWUKWTL327O2HAVCNFSM6AAAAACIYQRPY6VHI2DSMVQWIX3LMV43OSLTON2WKQ3PNVWWK3TUHMZTIOBTGE2DCOBSGY).\n>> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.Message ID: ***@***.***>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3483343782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-11-04T01:43:35Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
