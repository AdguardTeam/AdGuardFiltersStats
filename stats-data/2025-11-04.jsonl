I can confirm that there are zero ads and no playback issues with these.\n> > > ! --- HBO MAX / MAX APP CUSTOM BLOCKING LIST (AdGuard Home / DNS) --- ! Purpose: Block SSAI ad hosts and tracking CDNs used by the HBO / Max streaming app. ! Date: 2025-10-24 ! 1.

NOTES ! - Litix.io is a Conviva/advertising analytics endpoint; blocking may disable telemetry. ! - fwmrm.net (FreeWheel) is used for SSAI ads and sometimes player licensing; test playback. ! - The CloudFront and Max.com entries target ad or telemetry delivery used by HBO Max. ! - If the app fails to start or stream, comment out the fwmrm.net and discomax.com lines first.\n> > \n> > \n> > [@ajstrick81](https://github.com/ajstrick81) I blocked some of the domains u mentioned and I ran into issues on my Roku TV it spins literally for minutes then plays the video. U don't have this issue?\n> \n> Hey [@jo2dan94](https://github.com/jo2dan94) , I didn't experience any playback issues either on my Onn 4K Plus or my Android phone. I would maybe try clearing your app cache and force stopping the app? I just encountered the new ad domains that you listed today and will have to add them to my blocklist. Appreciate you pointing those out!\n\nSamsung TV must use a different sdk or something I still get ads at beginning and ads in between. As for the buffering problems it's because none of the h264.io domains can be blocked","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3483208129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-11-04T00:35:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
