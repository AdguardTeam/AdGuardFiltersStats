As long as you have a good internet connection (50Mbps plus), you should be able to stream in 1080P just fine.\r\n> 5. However, with Adguard enabled, it forces the stream to 360p and you get stutters, lags etc.\r\n> 6. See attached screenshots where without adguard I can stream 1080p but with it, I just get 360P and it lags/stutters.\r\n> Excluding the whole domain myfreecams.com from filtering does not fix this issue.\r\n> \r\nUsername: `@vicosphi`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/7trnt50lgh8o008cogskw0c484s8ksok64w2b5udn4.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/gdvksgnhcv4gc800ocs4csko80gg08wt8x1jpomge8.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.18.1 (4778) (CL 1.15.55, DL 2.5.33 )\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11, 24H2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>IndianList\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Import issue configuration (AdGuard for Windows)\r\n[Import](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=adguard%3Aimport_user_configuration%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fmyfreecams.com)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/188833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/188833/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-09-15T16:47:35Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
