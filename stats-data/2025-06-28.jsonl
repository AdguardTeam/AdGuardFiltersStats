Comment\r\n> AdGuard is unable to correctly handle Percent-Encoding (e.g., `%=` = `%25`, `&` = `%26`) under certain circumstances.  \r\n> This issue arises when processing specific URLs or URLs that contain Chinese characters.\r\n> \r\n> For example, try searching for **\"伺服器 ithome\"** on `www.google.com`.  \r\n> When opening the ithome website from the search results, the address cannot be entered properly.\r\n> \r\n> **Example URL:**\r\n> - [https://www.google.com/search?q=伺服器+ithome&newwindow=1](https://www.google.com/search?q=伺服器+ithome&newwindow=1)\r\n> -

`www.google.com` via the **AdGuard browser extension** on **MS Edge**, the issue can be quickly resolved.  \r\n> However, since I am using **AdGuard for Windows**, the problem may be related to features such as traffic filtering or HTTPS filtering.\r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

for the delayed reply.\n\n-----------------\n\n> Could you please test when this domain is blocked?\n\nI have roughly tested `https://www.pixiv.net/` on Firefox running on a desktop GNU/Linux machine and a real Android device, using two different IP addresses in Japan, and I didn't encounter any cases where the webpage did *not* communicate with lc-event.pixiv.net.\n\nNot sure if this is related, but I noticed that in my Firefox, uBO is the only one that can monitor requests with keepalive enabled in the logger.\nThe logger in AdGuard browser extension and even devtool utilities like the Network tab or XHR breakpoints overlook them.\nTherefore, if you still do not see the requests, you might find them in uBO's logger.\n\n-----------------\n\nAlso, `https://www.pixiv.net/novel` is apparently sending similar requests through GTM `https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-55FG`.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2556b82f-5cb2-48bc-9a83-29bff3359350)\n\n`https://lc-event.pixiv.net/log/pixiv/reco/novel?platform=...`\n\nI

It's not directly impacting viewing experience. Besides, I think subscribers of YouTube Premium are also presented with this Enhanced bitrate option in the quality menu.

Please answer the following questions for yourself before submitting an issue.\n\n- [x] I am running the latest version\n- [x] I made sure all content blockers are enabled in Safari settings\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed\n\n### AdGuard version\n\n1.11.22\n\n### Environment\n\n```markdown\n- OS: 15.5 (24F74)\n- Safari version: Version 18.5 (20621.2.5.11.8)\n```\n\n### What filters do you have enabled?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Issue Details\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Go to any site that has a cookie pop-up\n2. Cookie pop up is displayed even though all of the filters and blocklists for cookie pop-ups are enabled\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect to not see the cookie pop ups. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCookie pop-ups are displayed. \n\n### Screenshots\n\n<img width=\"2016\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36c6b33b-7b35-48f6-9130-0a6828d3cfc5\" />\n\n<img width=\"1072\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d716f87-5392-46e7-a038-49503ba14a0b\" />\n\n<img width=\"2016\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8957434b-3a9a-474a-933f-567f51796386\" />\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThe AdGuard test page reports that annoyance blocking is not enabled/detected - however these settings are turned on. This behaviour has started since I 'erased and reset all settings' on my MacBook and re-installed the AdGuard for Safari extension.

It's not directly impacting viewing experience. Besides, I think subscribers of YouTube Premium are also presented with this Enhanced bitrate option in the quality menu.

Please answer the following questions for yourself before submitting an issue.\n\n- [x] I am running the latest version\n- [x] I made sure all content blockers are enabled in Safari settings\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed\n\n### AdGuard version\n\n1.11.22\n\n### Environment\n\n```markdown\n- OS: 15.5 (24F74)\n- Safari version: Version 18.5 (20621.2.5.11.8)\n```\n\n### What filters do you have enabled?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Issue Details\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Go to any site that has a cookie pop-up\n2. Cookie pop up is displayed even though all of the filters and blocklists for cookie pop-ups are enabled\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect to not see the cookie pop ups. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCookie pop-ups are displayed. \n\n### Screenshots\n\n<img width=\"2016\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36c6b33b-7b35-48f6-9130-0a6828d3cfc5\" />\n\n<img width=\"1072\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d716f87-5392-46e7-a038-49503ba14a0b\" />\n\n<img width=\"2016\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8957434b-3a9a-474a-933f-567f51796386\" />\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThe AdGuard test page reports that annoyance blocking is not enabled/detected - however these settings are turned on. This behaviour has started since I 'erased and reset all settings' on my MacBook and re-installed the AdGuard for Safari extension.

It's not directly impacting viewing experience. Besides, I think subscribers of YouTube Premium are also presented with this Enhanced bitrate option in the quality menu.

Please answer the following questions for yourself before submitting an issue.\n\n- [x] I am running the latest version\n- [x] I made sure all content blockers are enabled in Safari settings\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed\n\n### AdGuard version\n\n1.11.22\n\n### Environment\n\n```markdown\n- OS: 15.5 (24F74)\n- Safari version: Version 18.5 (20621.2.5.11.8)\n```\n\n### What filters do you have enabled?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Issue Details\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Go to any site that has a cookie pop-up\n2. Cookie pop up is displayed even though all of the filters and blocklists for cookie pop-ups are enabled\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect to not see the cookie pop ups. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCookie pop-ups are displayed. \n\n### Screenshots\n\n<img width=\"2016\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36c6b33b-7b35-48f6-9130-0a6828d3cfc5\" />\n\n<img width=\"1072\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d716f87-5392-46e7-a038-49503ba14a0b\" />\n\n<img width=\"2016\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8957434b-3a9a-474a-933f-567f51796386\" />\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThe AdGuard test page reports that annoyance blocking is not enabled/detected - however these settings are turned on. This behaviour has started since I 'erased and reset all settings' on my MacBook and re-installed the AdGuard for Safari extension.

Please answer the following questions for yourself before submitting an issue.\n\n- [x] I am running the latest version\n- [x] I made sure all content blockers are enabled in Safari settings\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed\n\n### AdGuard version\n\n1.11.22\n\n### Environment\n\n```markdown\n- OS: 15.5 (24F74)\n- Safari version: Version 18.5 (20621.2.5.11.8)\n```\n\n### What filters do you have enabled?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Issue Details\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Go to any site that has a cookie pop-up\n2. Cookie pop up is displayed even though all of the filters and blocklists for cookie pop-ups are enabled\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect to not see the cookie pop ups. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCookie pop-ups are displayed. \n\n### Screenshots\n\n<img width=\"2016\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36c6b33b-7b35-48f6-9130-0a6828d3cfc5\" />\n\n<img width=\"1072\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d716f87-5392-46e7-a038-49503ba14a0b\" />\n\n<img width=\"2016\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8957434b-3a9a-474a-933f-567f51796386\" />\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThe AdGuard test page reports that annoyance blocking is not enabled/detected - however these settings are turned on. This behaviour has started since I 'erased and reset all settings' on my MacBook and re-installed the AdGuard for Safari extension.
