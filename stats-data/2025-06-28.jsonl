Comment\r\n> AdGuard is unable to correctly handle Percent-Encoding (e.g., `%=` = `%25`, `&` = `%26`) under certain circumstances.  \r\n> This issue arises when processing specific URLs or URLs that contain Chinese characters.\r\n> \r\n> For example, try searching for **\"‰º∫ÊúçÂô® ithome\"** on `www.google.com`.  \r\n> When opening the ithome website from the search results, the address cannot be entered properly.\r\n> \r\n> **Example URL:**\r\n> - [https://www.google.com/search?q=‰º∫ÊúçÂô®+ithome&newwindow=1](https://www.google.com/search?q=‰º∫ÊúçÂô®+ithome&newwindow=1)\r\n> -

`www.google.com` via the **AdGuard browser extension** on **MS Edge**, the issue can be quickly resolved.  \r\n> However, since I am using **AdGuard for Windows**, the problem may be related to features such as traffic filtering or HTTPS filtering.\r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

for the delayed reply.\n\n-----------------\n\n> Could you please test when this domain is blocked?\n\nI have roughly tested `https://www.pixiv.net/` on Firefox running on a desktop GNU/Linux machine and a real Android device, using two different IP addresses in Japan, and I didn't encounter any cases where the webpage did *not* communicate with lc-event.pixiv.net.\n\nNot sure if this is related, but I noticed that in my Firefox, uBO is the only one that can monitor requests with keepalive enabled in the logger.\nThe logger in AdGuard browser extension and even devtool utilities like the Network tab or XHR breakpoints overlook them.\nTherefore, if you still do not see the requests, you might find them in uBO's logger.\n\n-----------------\n\nAlso, `https://www.pixiv.net/novel` is apparently sending similar requests through GTM `https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-55FG`.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2556b82f-5cb2-48bc-9a83-29bff3359350)\n\n`https://lc-event.pixiv.net/log/pixiv/reco/novel?platform=...`\n\nI
