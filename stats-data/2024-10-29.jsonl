`||flowgpt.com/marketing/` not necessarily a tracking domain. but blocking this greatly speeds up page load time as this prevents loading of useless heavy marketing and first party advertisement (e.g. app install banners). disallowing may break the carousel component which you may need to hide with an additional cosmetic filtering. but for me it was working okay.\r\n3. `||flowgpt.com/mp/track` more tracking\r\n4. `||tianji.flowgpt.com^` loads some tracking scripts. blocking this domain entirely prevents loading of those scripts and further network requests. works flawlessly from my testing past two weeks. however, inferring from the domain name, it may cause breakage in future.\r\n5. `||awswaf.com/*/telemetry` flowgpt uses AWS WAF for PoW verification of your browser. blocking awswaf entirely will prevent you from being able to converse. but any site uses awswaf collects some rather harmless metrics. But the problem is AWS does this continuously in background, even when you aren't present with a \"not a bot\" challenge. Blocking this has no adverse side effects and on the contrary this saves lots of bandwidth on globally any website making use of awswaf (e.g. huggingface.co).\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/191876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/191876/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-10-29T14:36:36Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
