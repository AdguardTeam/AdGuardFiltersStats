Comment\r\n> I use this chrome extension for adblocking on sites like \"www.open.spotify.com\" , \"www.youtube.com\" and \"www.brainly.in\". Recently, an issue on \"www.open.spotify.com\" has been annoying me a lot. Whenever an ad comes on Spotify, Ad guard isn't able to completely remove it. Ad guard is able to stop it from playing but that's it. The whole music player is stuck at that point. No matter what you do, your music won't start unless you reload the site.\r\n> \r\n>  Please fix this issue.
