Я переустановил приложение Adguard Nightly. Все настройки ввел вручную. Переустановил сертификат. Обновил фильтры. Почистил кэш обоих браузеров. Поменял поисковый запрос на случай если кэш не почистился. Рекламный блок вверху все равно есть. Написал в чат.  Проблема воспроизводится не у всех. Попробовал включить / выключить системный DNS от Adguard. Никакого эффекта. Реклама все ещё есть.

Я переустановил приложение Adguard Nightly. Все настройки ввел вручную. Переустановил сертификат. Обновил фильтры. Почистил кэш обоих браузеров. Поменял поисковый запрос на случай если кэш не почистился. Рекламный блок вверху все равно есть. Написал в чат.  Проблема воспроизводится не у всех. Попробовал включить / выключить системный DNS от Adguard. Никакого эффекта. Реклама все ещё есть.
