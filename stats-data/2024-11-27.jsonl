\r\n\r\nDear Adguard team, It's username leel.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid to tell you this userscript works no more. It worked until the time I had posted this issue. However, because the kemono.su site changed its structure two days ago (mentioned on its matrix chats), the userscript won't work whether adguard is turned off or not. Sorry for this, and thank you for your attention.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2502534208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-27T02:23:33Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
