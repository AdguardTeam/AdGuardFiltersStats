Проблема в том, что при включенном adguard невозможно писать что-то на поле поиска. А при отключенном adguard раздражает окно выбора языка. Если блокировать окно выбора языка, невозможно будет писать в поле поиска. Хотелось, что сайт автоматический выбрал армянский язык и не спрашивал каждый раз, но сайт мой выбор не помнит, я в режиме инкогнито пользуюсь, но выбор языка на не приватной окне вопрос не решает. \r\n> \r\n> Достаточно посетить этот сайт и блокировать элемент (окно) выбора языка, и невозможно станет писать в поле поиска. Хотелось, чтобы адгуард убрал этот окно выбора языка и что там возможно было писать, а то не реагирует на клавиатуру, нужно добавить /am,   /ru   или /en на конце list.am, чтобы опознал наш выбор языка и позволил писать, непрактично так. Может вы найдете решение? С отключенным адгуард сайт работает, но  вскакивает окно выбора языка. Блокиратор рекламы Опера на результат не влияет. Это из за адгуард и из за плохой настройки сайта лист.ам. \r\n> \r\n> Спасибо заранее. \r\nUsername: `@Рафаэль`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qz5dmj2fz400ckgkw0o0w484sow0gw0sov64vut6tc.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mdzjagp7zms08wok8co48kg4c4k0k046y08gm9fj5c.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.14\r\nSystem version: | Linux x86_64\r\nBrowser: | Opera\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Germany, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>IndianList</details>\r\nOther extensions used: | Opera стандартный блокировщик рекламы, который идет с браузером Опера.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173308/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-22T01:17:51Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Приложения Adguard я НЕ ИСПОЛЬЗУЮ. Соответственно, куда вносить исключения? Ответ - только на уровне настроек профилей DNS на вашей стороне.\r\n\r\nИ это проблема ломает не только приложение Яндекса \"Все аптеки\", но иногда вызывает проблемы с приложением \"Едадил\", но по нему вроде как уже все нормально последние недели.\r\n\r\nСоответственно топовое приложение \"Все аптеки\" от топового разработчика \"Яндекс\" ломается на уровне вашего DNS.\r\nВывод: мне кажется, это требует однозначного исправления на уровне общих настроек вашего dns, т.к. никакими другими способами это исправить нельзя, кроме как покупать приложение и вносить исключения - не думаю, что обычные рядовые пользователи не сильные в IT будут так усложнять себе жизнь.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1958754655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-22T05:54:25Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

( [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing#264](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing/issues/264) )\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n> Please check that there no another web browser extension that has adblocking feature is enabled on your web browser. It can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \r\n> Saving memory feature of your web browser or sleep feature of your operating system can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n> In this case, please re-enable AdGuard's filtering by toggling the protection toggle.\r\n> Following the instructions can be needed.\r\n\r\n### The instructions\r\n1.

They can be found by:\r\n`document.cookie =`\r\nThey must be replaced by `set-cookie` / `set-cookie-reload` / `trusted-set-cookie-reload` scriptlet rules.\r\n\r\nThere are many old rules, so first you need to check if the site is available, and then the need for the rule.\r\n\r\n* For convenience, you can work in a separate browser\r\n* Retrieve the list of domains, clean up duplicates and check if sites exist (if redirects occur, we assume that the site is dead).\r\n* All such rules can be merged into one file, convert them to exception rules and import as custom filter.

Comment\r\n> Pornhub links in google search results cannot be middle-clicked to have them open in a new tab while the extension is active for pornhub. I tried disabling all the relevant filters, like for pop-ups but still couldn't middle-click any pornhub links on google. I didn't know how to make user rules for this specific problem, so that might still be possible somehow. Nobody wants to have ads on pornhub obviously, so they can't just disable it for pornhub entirely. I also tried disabling it on google itself by the way, but that did not have any effect, still wouldn't open.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pw8qt6yc9pcgs8ok8sc4kksc0sksogko76p56al64g.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mmdr408v4cgwcw8g884s0wc4gc44cw0d7y7sm8pr94.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.13\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 Pro, versie 22H2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>List-KR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1959635302","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050#issuecomment-1959635302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050","id":1959635302,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM850zalm","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-22T15:01:38Z","updated_at":"2024-02-22T15:01:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> öncelikle youtube, blu tv, google gibi sitelerde çalışır durumda iken internet kesintisi olmuş gibi bağlantı kesmekte, sayfayı yenilemek çıkıp tekrar geri girmek gibi çözümler sonuç vermemekte.\r\n\r\nBrowser extension cannot affect DNS.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1959635302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-22T15:01:40Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Pornhub links in google search results cannot be middle-clicked to have them open in a new tab while the extension is active for pornhub. I tried disabling all the relevant filters, like for pop-ups but still couldn't middle-click any pornhub links on google. I didn't know how to make user rules for this specific problem, so that might still be possible somehow. Nobody wants to have ads on pornhub obviously, so they can't just disable it for pornhub entirely. I also tried disabling it on google itself by the way, but that did not have any effect, still wouldn't open.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pw8qt6yc9pcgs8ok8sc4kksc0sksogko76p56al64g.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mmdr408v4cgwcw8g884s0wc4gc44cw0d7y7sm8pr94.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.13\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 Pro, versie 22H2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>List-KR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-22T15:01:39Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Pornhub links in google search results cannot be middle-clicked to have them open in a new tab while the extension is active for pornhub. I tried disabling all the relevant filters, like for pop-ups but still couldn't middle-click any pornhub links on google. I didn't know how to make user rules for this specific problem, so that might still be possible somehow. Nobody wants to have ads on pornhub obviously, so they can't just disable it for pornhub entirely.

I tried disabling all the relevant filters, like for pop-ups but still couldn't middle-click any pornhub links on google. I didn't know how to make user rules for this specific problem, so that might still be possible somehow. Nobody wants to have ads on pornhub obviously, so they can't just disable it for pornhub entirely. I also tried disabling it on google itself by the way, but that did not have any effect, still wouldn't open.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pw8qt6yc9pcgs8ok8sc4kksc0sksogko76p56al64g.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mmdr408v4cgwcw8g884s0wc4gc44cw0d7y7sm8pr94.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.13\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 Pro, versie 22H2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>List-KR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-22T16:08:22Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
