Проблема в том, что при включенном adguard невозможно писать что-то на поле поиска. А при отключенном adguard раздражает окно выбора языка. Если блокировать окно выбора языка, невозможно будет писать в поле поиска. Хотелось, что сайт автоматический выбрал армянский язык и не спрашивал каждый раз, но сайт мой выбор не помнит, я в режиме инкогнито пользуюсь, но выбор языка на не приватной окне вопрос не решает. \r\n> \r\n> Достаточно посетить этот сайт и блокировать элемент (окно) выбора языка, и невозможно станет писать в поле поиска. Хотелось, чтобы адгуард убрал этот окно выбора языка и что там возможно было писать, а то не реагирует на клавиатуру, нужно добавить /am,   /ru   или /en на конце list.am, чтобы опознал наш выбор языка и позволил писать, непрактично так. Может вы найдете решение? С отключенным адгуард сайт работает, но  вскакивает окно выбора языка. Блокиратор рекламы Опера на результат не влияет. Это из за адгуард и из за плохой настройки сайта лист.ам. \r\n> \r\n> Спасибо заранее. \r\nUsername: `@Рафаэль`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qz5dmj2fz400ckgkw0o0w484sow0gw0sov64vut6tc.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mdzjagp7zms08wok8co48kg4c4k0k046y08gm9fj5c.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.14\r\nSystem version: | Linux x86_64\r\nBrowser: | Opera\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Germany, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>IndianList</details>\r\nOther extensions used: | Opera стандартный блокировщик рекламы, который идет с браузером Опера.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173308/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-22T01:17:51Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Приложения Adguard я НЕ ИСПОЛЬЗУЮ. Соответственно, куда вносить исключения? Ответ - только на уровне настроек профилей DNS на вашей стороне.\r\n\r\nИ это проблема ломает не только приложение Яндекса \"Все аптеки\", но иногда вызывает проблемы с приложением \"Едадил\", но по нему вроде как уже все нормально последние недели.\r\n\r\nСоответственно топовое приложение \"Все аптеки\" от топового разработчика \"Яндекс\" ломается на уровне вашего DNS.\r\nВывод: мне кажется, это требует однозначного исправления на уровне общих настроек вашего dns, т.к. никакими другими способами это исправить нельзя, кроме как покупать приложение и вносить исключения - не думаю, что обычные рядовые пользователи не сильные в IT будут так усложнять себе жизнь.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1958754655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-22T05:54:25Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
