Creating the pull request\r\n\r\nIn relation to https://github.com/EasyList-Lithuania/easylist_lithuania/pull/26#issuecomment-1818342187, I took a look at https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/BaseFilter/sections/foreign.txt, noticed `delfi.lv` entries in the Lithuanian section, and thought \"Wait, that can't be right?\"\r\n\r\nSo I
