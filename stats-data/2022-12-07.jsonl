So I'm having this issue where I can't use ClickUp with AdGuard enabled. This started happening around 1 month ago. I created a rule for AdGuard to ignore ClickUp, but it's useless. As long as AdGuard is enabled, ClickUp does not work. I also noticed that sometimes, if I disable the DNS protection, ClickUp works. But it's not consistent.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/QV5trTh.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/vAlqji0.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.9.1.1217\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (), <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS (DNS-Over-QUIC)`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter, The Block List Project - Abuse List (adguard), The Block List Project - Ads List (adguard), The Block List Project - Facebook List (adguard), The Block List Project - Malware List (adguard), The Block List Project - Phishing List (adguard), The Block List Project - Ramsonware List (adguard), The Block List Project - Redirect List (adguard), The Block List Project - Scam List (adguard), The Block List Project - Tracking List (adguard).`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant, AdGuard Extra.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/136811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/136811/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1341144894","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/136811#issuecomment-1341144894","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/136811","id":1341144894,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85P8D8-","user":{"login":"DandelionSprout","id":22780683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzgwNjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22780683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout","html_url":"https://github.com/DandelionSprout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-07T15:34:49Z","updated_at":"2022-12-07T15:34:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Though the site seems to require logging in, I'm thinking there may be problems with some of the enabled lists.
