Прошу помочь, когда AdGuard включён приложение Dasher работает некорректно, а я работаю через него. Само приложение ставится на паузу в течении пары минут после запуска, если продолжить работу то снова ставится на паузу через пару минут. Если выключить AdGuard проблема проходит. На приложение Uber не влияет и работает корректно. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/becnoz7pinsww4kg4040cwcsw4o8ggsftaoxsdj868.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/gaa1b3oaea88cgokkgss4koo0osog8ojzbwpl7hrn4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/fgbop0zc6e0c8w40s48wc8k440sowo4638t2bc1tu0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/iwurttib7i0woo08g4s4kcog8c4kw40sywobub3k74.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/9x7myff2hvs4kko048wsk8g484cow84pi0s9a8a1us.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.6\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS `<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155490/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-05T00:01:17Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
