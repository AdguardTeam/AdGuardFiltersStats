Again, I know very little about web stuff but I’m retired from a life in IT so I get around and clearly must be a little bored.\n\nAnyway, when I go to a story like this one:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/19/us/desantis-florida-ap-african-american-studies.html\n\nI think it runs a script that is contained in another file\n    <script defer src=\"/vi-assets/static-assets/story-7b870824025a8e3b4049.js\"></script>\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/vi-assets/static-assets/story-7b870824025a8e3b4049.js\n\nThat script appears to have code in it that adds a class dynamically to the original HTML page using createelement statement.  That class does this pop-up thing I believe.\n\nI browsed the page directly on the Mac  (no iPad) and while it does run the same script which contains the same code, it does not add it to the page on the Mac.  I’m guessing there is logic in the script somewhere that determines the platform.\n\nThe class that gets added to the page is below (though I manually formated it).   I am wondering if blocking it with a Safari user rule on the iPad would work.  But I’m not sure exactly how content filters are formatted.   Would you be willing to help me with the safari user rule syntax?  I’m guessing it’s something like nytimes.com <http://nytimes.com/>###div.read-in-app…. But I tried a few variations and had no luck.\n\nWould the user rule prevent the script from adding the div class programmatically?\n\nAnyway I appreciate all your help.\n\n\nHere is the class that gets created:\n\n<div class=\"read-in-app-disrupter shown expanded expanded-dock css-1y8ywa3 efw9frv0\" data-testid=\"expanded-dock\" aria-label=\"A message from The Times\">\n    <div
