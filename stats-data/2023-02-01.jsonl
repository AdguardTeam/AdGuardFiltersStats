Совсем. Адгуард фильтрует только те приложения, в которые я захожу. И то не всегда фильтрует в одном приложении всегда отслеживание. Есть в скриншотах журнал фильтрации, где указано блокировка отслеживания в приложении Radio Player. То есть снанала,  адгуард заблокировал его отслеживание, а потом уже нет. Помимо этого, я включил ECH, так как советовали авторы ваших статей на вашем сайте. Там шла речь, о стабильной версии Адгуард и что в скрытых настройках вашего приложения есть функции где можно включить есн, doh, чтобы теперь не только браузер но и приложения использовали ECH.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/vo7anQ0.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/U4HJW2D.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/L8bY7KO.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 6.0.1\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.0+nightly+38+(82)\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (2320), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (120), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Location API, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `tls://security.cloudflare-dns.com`<br>filters: `DnsUserRules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>road-block, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>Polish GDPR-Cookies Filters, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>ROList, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>Xfiles, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters</details>\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Нет ничего другого, стороннего.

Comment\r\n> A lot of sites have been popping up with the human check (press and hold) since using Adguard, turn it off and it works just fine, in this case choose another method and still the same result, nothing happens. Only works turning Adguard off which defeats the purpose of having it if you have to turn it off constantly to make things work.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/c3mU2fI.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/StdwLyP.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | EdgeChromium\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1411685267","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141218#issuecomment-1411685267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141218","id":1411685267,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85UJJuT","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-01T08:54:08Z","updated_at":"2023-02-01T08:54:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">A lot of sites have been popping up with the human check (press and hold) since using Adguard\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I cannot reproduce this issue (there is a captcha on the reported website, but it occurs even without AdGuard).\r\nPlease provide steps how to reproduce it and also please check if issue occurs if you disable `Stealth mode` and third party filter lists:\r\n```\r\nEasyPrivacy\r\nLegitimate URL Shortener\r\nAdblock Warning Removal List\r\nOnline Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nNoCoin Filter List\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1411685267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-01T08:54:09Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Conent Blocker is making websites unscrollable. The problem is caused by removing the policy popup thus it's impossible to click 'Accept'.

Hi. Cannot reproduce with your settengs. Please check what causes an issue - filters or stealth mode (disable one by one with checking)\r\n\r\ni think it has something to do with dandelion sprout's annoyances list and easylist cookie list. i unchecked those two and it seems to be working. its also an intermittent failure to load, as i have also gotten the error again even without those two checked. i unchecked, then rechecked \"i dont care about cookies\" and that seemed to fix it. the error is popping up because the page is querying for cookies but the filter is blocking the cookies, which probably creates some sort of open feedback loop (im not a programmer, but its probably something in the same vein as how 10 cant be divided 3 times perfectly equally.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1412189003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-01T14:53:24Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Conent Blocker is making websites unscrollable. The problem is caused by removing the policy popup thus it's impossible to click 'Accept'. To be more specific, AdGuard doesn't remove it at all but lefts the invisible layer that covers document body, causing the problem.
