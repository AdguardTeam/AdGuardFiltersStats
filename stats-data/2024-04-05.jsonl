Would be beneficial if those could be skipped straight to vote button being clickable instantly, as used to be the case with Adguard. Discord account is likely required to replicate this. If I enable Braves internal blocker, it shows the initial 4 second cooldown but skips the second one, so I imagine it should be possible to fix in adguard. \r\nUsername: `@SquizzleGH`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/d4ah09pz6y8s4c88cwg0c4s8ckoswso9tpm3yied7g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/czlzphcsbfsokskw4okgwk4sk4cw0s8acaoq45omds.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.3.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 10\r\nBrowser: | Brave for android\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`, `https://big.oisd.nl`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175940/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-05T14:54:54Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Then, enable the AdGuard popup filter and visit https://www.allegiantair.com. This will lead to the error shown in my attached screenshot.\r\n> \r\n> To resolve this, disable the AdGuard popup filter by accessing uBlock Origin settings.

Comment\r\n> It seems that the adguard popup filter is blocking the login dialog from https://www.allegiantair.com.\r\n> \r\n> If you've previously visited allegiantair.com without using the AdGuard popup filter, you'll need to clear cookies from allegiantair.com first. Then, enable the AdGuard popup filter and visit https://www.allegiantair.com. This will lead to the error shown in my attached screenshot.\r\n> \r\n> To resolve this, disable the AdGuard popup filter by accessing uBlock Origin settings. Uncheck the box next to the specific filter and click apply.
