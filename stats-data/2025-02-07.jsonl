Comment\r\n> При включении dns защиты и выбора dns сервера adguard-dns.io при поиске в google отображается только первые 10 картинок или видео. Остальные картинки не прогружаются.  Отключение расширенной защиты или защиты safari никак не влияет. Смена dns сервера на любой, отличный от AdGuard решает проблему. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

for Windows unfortunately isn't set to cover every single app on a PC by default (I personally wish it would).\n\nPresuming AdGuard too is running in German on your PC, then it can be set to cover Outlook in \"Netzwerk\" → \"Liste der gefilteren Anwendungen\" → \"+\" → \"Nach Anwendung süchen …\" → Find `outlook.exe` on your PC and select it.\n\nHowever, even then would AdGuard struggle a bit with fixing it, as it doesn't support `##`-type entries in non-browser programs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2641827247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-02-07T03:07:08Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
