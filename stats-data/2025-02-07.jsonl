Comment\r\n> При включении dns защиты и выбора dns сервера adguard-dns.io при поиске в google отображается только первые 10 картинок или видео. Остальные картинки не прогружаются.  Отключение расширенной защиты или защиты safari никак не влияет. Смена dns сервера на любой, отличный от AdGuard решает проблему. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Nie ma możliwości go wcisnąć. Nie działa też \"enter\" po wpisaniu hasła. Problem na każdej przeglądarce. Safari Macos, Opera Windows, Safari iOs. Pomaga tylko wyłączenie adguard systemowo.

Comment\r\n> Problem z logowaniem do poczty gazeta.pl. Na ekranie logowania przy włączonym adguard cała strona wygląda jakby była w trybie tekstowy, są pola gdzie można wpisać login i hasło do konta, ale przycisk \"zaloguj\" jest wygaszony. Nie ma możliwości go wcisnąć. Nie działa też \"enter\" po wpisaniu hasła. Problem na każdej przeglądarce. Safari Macos, Opera Windows, Safari iOs. Pomaga tylko wyłączenie adguard systemowo. Wyłączenie i włączenie przeglądarki. \r\nUsername: `@Dżonk`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8q8jnect4vk8cg48w4404cc0kc4w4wgkkr2l7v4lxw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2ounef9qbpc0g4k8wc40oskcs8k4s045n056gyurpg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.19.0 (4853)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.26100.0\r\nBrowser: | Opera\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`, `User DNS filter (url: none)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nCustom filters: | User filter (url: none)\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | brak\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&clid=pLTb6O&custom_filters=User%2520filter%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.custom_bootstrap=&dns.custom_fallback=&dns.custom_filters=User%2520DNS%2520filter%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_mode=System&dns.filters=15&dns.servers=System&dns.timeout=0&extensions=AdGuard%2520Extra%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29%2CAdGuard%2520Popup%2520Blocker%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fpopup-blocker%2F2.5%2Fpopupblocker.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=2.3.4.6.8.10.16.109.216.238&license_type=paid&product_type=Win&product_version=7.19.0+%284853%29&referrer=&scheme_version=2&stealth.enabled=false&system_version=Microsoft+Windows+NT+10.0.26100.0&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F131.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36+OPR%2F116.0.0.0&utm_campaign=report&utm_medium=assistant&utm_source=win&win.wfp=true)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197950/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-02-07T07:57:52Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

However, [the rule](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197989#issuecomment-2642162131) is in the filter. There might be another element or the site loads as is for some reason.\n\nOk, that explains the differs in rules. Not so long ago I was missing 1 rule, and after installing Adguard again, I had the correct rules. Thought this was the same problem, but it was not. 😁 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2642306343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-02-07T08:58:56Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
