Comment\r\n> YouTubeモバイル版(m.youtube.com)のショッピング動画において、オーバーレイ広告が表示され、自動再生が妨害される問題について:\r\n> YouTubeモバイル版(m.youtube.com)でショッピング動画を再生する際、オーバーレイ広告が表示され、自動再生が妨害される現象が発生しています。  \r\n> \r\n> 現象の詳細:\r\n> ショッピング動画では、日本語だと「ショッピングしますか？」、英語だと「Ready to shop?」というオーバーレイ広告が表示されます。  \r\n> 通常、動画ページを開くと自動で再生が開始されるはずですが、オーバーレイ広告が表示される動画では、オーバーレイを閉じた後も、動画画面を1回タップしないと再生が始まりません。(自動再生が妨害される)  \r\n> 例:\r\n> https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mmTmdMGbk_M \r\n> \r\n> 試した対策:\r\n> 以下のフィルタでオーバーレイ広告自体は非表示にすることに成功しました。  \r\n> m.youtube.com##.ytm-bottom-sheet-overlay-container\r\n> m.youtube.com##div#global-loader\r\n> しかし、このフィルタを適用しても、オーバーレイ広告が出ているときと同様に、動画画面を1回タップしないと再生が始まりません。(自動再生が妨害されたまま) \r\n> \r\n> 質問:\r\n> この問題を回避して、ショッピング動画でも自動再生を維持する方法はありますか？\r\n> お知恵をお貸しいただけると助かります。よろしくお願いいたします。  \r\n> \r\n> 環境:\r\n> Android 14\r\n> Firefox Mobile 135\r\n> uBlock Origin 1.62.0\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n

Comment\r\n> При включении dns защиты и выбора dns сервера adguard-dns.io при поиске в google отображается только первые 10 картинок или видео. Остальные картинки не прогружаются.  Отключение расширенной защиты или защиты safari никак не влияет. Смена dns сервера на любой, отличный от AdGuard решает проблему. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Comment\r\n> При включении dns защиты и выбора dns сервера adguard-dns.io при поиске в google отображается только первые 10 картинок или видео. Остальные картинки не прогружаются.  Отключение расширенной защиты или защиты safari никак не влияет. Смена dns сервера на любой, отличный от AdGuard решает проблему. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Gdy klikam przycisk PLAY obok kafelka stacji, np. \"RMF\" odtwarzacz na dole zatrzymuje się, trzeba go kliknąć ponownie. 1 screen.\r\n> Gdy wyłączam AdGuard i kliknę przycisk play obok kafelka stacji jak \"RMF\" wtedy odtwarzacz na dole uruchamia się po reklamie video.\r\n> The site still does not work properly with AdGuard enabled. When I click the PLAY button next to the station tile, e.g. “RMF” the player at the bottom stops, you have to click it again. 1 screen.\r\n> When I turn off AdGuard and click the play button next to the station tile like “RMF” then the player at the bottom launches after the video ad. 2 screen.\r\n> Hope this description helps, thanks in advance for patient and help :)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/nv4ud0turw0osgsk48g0ss04g804c0c1uco00eozq1.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/9p0dvsaqu7gooc80kkos04w08wc8os0ibx0me4e0hs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.0.185 MV3\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Quick Fixes<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Windows Defender","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2633889686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-02-04T13:19:48Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
