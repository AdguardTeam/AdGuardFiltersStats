Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2FPETEandrepete_%2Fstatus%2F1788379241815445981)\r\n### Comment\r\n> I use the app “Downie” https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/ to download audio, video, and images from various websites.   One such was of starting a download is to paste the URL of a page that contains the item you want to download.   \r\n> \r\n> This works 100% of the time for everything EXCEPT Twitter.   Excuse me, X.com.   \r\n> \r\n> So say I want to download this gif of a tornado that I just tweeted.  The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.   Disable it and you can now use either x.com or twitter.com URLs.\r\n> \r\n> A while back I THOUGHT i had nailed this down as being related to DNS Protection, which i had  been using at the time.  Seems like when I changed it or disabled it the problem went away, however that is not the case as of now.   So the only workaround is to change the URL manually.\r\nUsername: `@petekjohnson`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2hn926dr1ym8ssscccswg0osw4g4ccge5e4zuoc6nw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3avlpgf7gpmookk8wwok00go80g0k0or8jv4569tsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4inmkqoses6cwck00k0g4kggk084w4scuu435qluj4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/k5j80az0yyo00ggogs4gs0c0ccgs8kkplp9qmb41k0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/olobxet5y68wskgs4cgks00wc0cg04gtbazl40rees.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/dy5dcp60nvkgg4c0so84gws4sk4soocl2sdssp4tf4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.14.0.1599 nightly\r\nSystem version: | macOS 14.5 Beta (23F5074a)\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode options: | Block Java, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your IP address (208.54.104.184), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Downie Safari Extension, AdGuard Assistant","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2142531673","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862#issuecomment-2142531673","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862","id":2142531673,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85_tHBZ","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-31T15:45:40Z","updated_at":"2024-05-31T15:45:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Cookie notification\r\n\r\nNot reproduced.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2142531673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-31T15:45:42Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

При этом проблема была протестирована таким образом:\r\n1. Выключен антивирус и блокировщик - ФР: Работает.\r\n2. Включен антивирус и выключен блокировщик -ФР: Работает.\r\n3. Выключен антивирус включен блокировщик - ФР: Не работает.\r\n\r\nДалее были проведены следующие диагностические мероприятия:\r\n1. выключен антивирус, включен блокировщик и целиком выключены все возможные фильтры.\r\n2. поочерёдно с выдержкой таймаута после включения были проверены все фильтры по одному.\r\n\r\nПроблема воспроизвелась только при включении \"Фильтрация HTTPS\". При добавлении исключения доменного имени 4pda.to из фильтрации - сайт отображался, но при этом не работала фильтрация на этом портале (что и ожидалось).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2142506250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-31T15:30:08Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> I use the app “Downie” https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/ to download audio, video, and images from various websites.   One such was of starting a download is to paste the URL of a page that contains the item you want to download.   \r\n> \r\n> This works 100% of the time for everything EXCEPT Twitter.   Excuse me, X.com.   \r\n> \r\n> So say I want to download this gif of a tornado that I just tweeted.  The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.   Disable it and you can now use either x.com or twitter.com URLs.\r\n> \r\n> A while back I THOUGHT i had nailed this down as being related to DNS Protection, which i had  been using at the time.  Seems like when I changed it or disabled it the problem went away, however that is not the case as of now.   So the only workaround is to change the URL manually.\r\nUsername: `@petekjohnson`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
