playing every 3 song as if their isn't even an ad blocker at all ! I tried using the \"Block ads on this site\" feature and clicked on the ad but it only removed the image and not the add ad itself.. This extension was working fine until around June 2022, i tried to be patient and tried redownloading it but that didn't help. It's now almost 2023 and i'm tired of this. Please fix the issue asap !\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/jmLHyoe.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>List-KR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1367657649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-12-30T00:27:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

today. When you click anywhere on the screen you will be re-directed to another site that is fortunately blocked by adguard. On occasion ads will show on the side and on the screen. A circular button labeled skip ads will appear in the middle. I installed ublock to see if it was effective but was not. Thank you for the help. The reason why the site is labeled as NSFW is that some ads contain nudity and other NSFW content.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/BtS1oYz.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11.3\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `94.140.14.140,94.140.14.141`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/windows/filters/15.txt, User+rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>Icelandic ABP List, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1367736735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-12-30T05:33:07Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
