When I visit certain websites that display an anti-adblock message, AdGuard successfully prevents the wall from appearing. However, this seems to interfere with YouTube video playback.\r\n> \r\n> Steps to reproduce:\r\n> 1. Install AdGuard Browser Extension.\r\n> 2. Go to YouTube and try playing a video with enabling the AdGuard Browser Extension\r\n> 3. Observe that the wall is blocked by AdGuard.\r\n> \r\n> Expected behavior:\r\n> - YouTube videos should play normally.\r\n> -Also noticed that when I clean that Website Cookies and watched the YouTube (without signing in my Account) the video plays find even with Adguard Extension enable. but after I signed in the Wall appear again and can't watch the video.\r\n> \r\n> Actual behavior:\r\n> - YouTube videos do not play after the anti-adblock wall is blocked by AdGuard.\r\n> \r\n> Additional information:\r\n> - Browser: [Chrome]\r\n> - AdGuard Browser Extension version: [Version 4.2.226]\r\n> \r\n> Please investigate this issue and provide a fix if possible.

think that scriptlet rules should not be added as a generic solution (except probably few of them), so I have changed the rule.\r\n\r\nBasically it looks like that the problem is as mentioned before, old app uses old scriptlets library and some scriptlets have been improved/fixed in new version of the app.\r\nThe same problem may occurs on other websites where such scriptlets are applied, but if it would be added for specific website, then it would not be removed if it works correctly with latest version of the app.
