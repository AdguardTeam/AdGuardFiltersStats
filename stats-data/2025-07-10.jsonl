The list strips it out on specific domains only (see for example specific.txt at [L22](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/TrackParamFilter/sections/specific.txt#L22), [L47](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/TrackParamFilter/sections/specific.txt#L47), etc.)\n\nIs this intended? Have you noticed that stripping out `ref` by default breaks too many websites? I've tried to find issues or docs about this but couldn't (expected to see it under [Limitations](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/filter-policy/#limitations-and-exceptions-1) of tracking protection).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n`*$removeparam=ref`\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208934/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3056488032","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208934#issuecomment-3056488032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208934","id":3056488032,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM862Lk5g","user":{"login":"krystian3w","id":35370833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzcwODMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35370833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w","html_url":"https://github.com/krystian3w","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-10T09:14:18Z","updated_at":"2025-07-10T09:14:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This might start by grouping all ref deletions in same place while keeping their source comments.\n\nThis seems a bit against the new up rule, but has anyone checked recently whether websites have stopped using this parameter voluntarily?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3056488032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-10T09:14:22Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
