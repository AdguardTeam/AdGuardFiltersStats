Comment\r\n> spotify was working fine with brave + adguard a few days ago, now it just stops playing completely when there's an advertisement. i've tried with just brave ad protection, just adguard, with both, and with neither. if there's an ad blocker the music stops. without the ad blocker there are ads. since it's both ad blockers, it might be the spotify website itself, but please let me know if there's anything i can do to not watch ads + not have my music stop every couple of songs.\r\nUsername: `@elysia831`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot
