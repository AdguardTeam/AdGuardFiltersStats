Kaspersky Endpoint Security для Windows v.12.8.0.505 и AdGuard for Windows v7.20.1 (4966) конфликтуют из за компонента _Фильтрация HTTPS_ кто из них виноват непонятно, но по отдельности запущенные программы документы открываются!!!!!\n\nЗдравствуйте. В этом случае должно помочь создание взаимных исключений в обеих программах. \n\nВ AdGuard перейдите в \"Настройки → Основные настройки → Расширенные настройки” и найдите пункт “Исключите приложение из фильтрации, введя полный путь”. Добавьте в строку ниже пути к процессам антивируса. Например: `C:\\Program Files\\ESET\\ESET Smart Security\\x86\\ekrn.exe`\n\nВ список исключений Kaspersky нужно добавить службы приложения `AdguardSvc.exe` и `Adguard.exe`. По умолчанию путь к ним выглядит следующим образом: `C:\\Program Files\\AdGuard`\n\nПосле этого перезагрузите устройство и проверьте, сохраняется ли проблема.

I use our family computer so I'm not sure if somebody changed something thats affected it, but I deleted and reinstalled it, and only checked the starting filters, so I don't know if this really isn't possible to prevent anymore or if I'm missing something. Maybe Hulu updated their user agreement and that's changed its something, but I also have this installed on Windows and it works fine, last I checked.\r\nUsername: `@sendhelpthanks`\r\n\r\n###
