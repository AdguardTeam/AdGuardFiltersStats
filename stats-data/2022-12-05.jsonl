The same goes for Google Drive, I click the download button it does request some domains but it doesn't start the download. This issue is kinda weird because when I turn off and restart firefox, now I can download files from GMail and GDrive. But just turning the protection on/off still won't let me download files from GMail/GDrive. Maybe you can find a way to fix this because when I reported this to Google, they didn't like the idea of me mentioning Adguard, they tried to blaim it on Adguard directly which I think is unfair.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/me2EIuk.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/me2EIuk.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11.3\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://dns.adguard-dns.com`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/windows/filters/15.txt, User+rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>ABPindo, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>Polish Annoyances Filters, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>IndianList, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch</details>\r\nUserscripts: | https://adsbypasser.github.io/releases/adsbypasser.lite.es7.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/136672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/136672/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-12-05T05:28:06Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

The same goes for Google Drive, I click the download button it does request some domains but it doesn't start the download.
