Would be beneficial if those could be skipped straight to vote button being clickable instantly, as used to be the case with Adguard. Discord account is likely required to replicate this. If I enable Braves internal blocker, it shows the initial 4 second cooldown but skips the second one, so I imagine it should be possible to fix in adguard. \r\nUsername: `@SquizzleGH`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/d4ah09pz6y8s4c88cwg0c4s8ckoswso9tpm3yied7g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/czlzphcsbfsokskw4okgwk4sk4cw0s8acaoq45omds.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.3.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 10\r\nBrowser: | Brave for android\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`, `https://big.oisd.nl`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175940/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-29T10:02:24Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Screenshots were requested with Adguard disabled when I opened this issue last, those emails ended up in spam folder so it got closed. Sorry about that. I'm sending it again and hopefully you'll be able to fix it. Ads are both images (the aws ones) and video (mathem, estimated 30 seconds each) you may need a discord account to properly replicate this but it's a trusted and free platform so hoping it can be done. \r\nUsername: `@SquizzleGH`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/87c74a7f4ls844ws0s0gskcw0c0s88oqxqw1prqkhw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ci63w1tev8088scccoc0g04kk4skos43mo2uhvs9zw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/7ywlrh3xc0000ssgwk4owcos4wsskkg377zkcg7v1y.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/sw98fr0g9340ksg4k0w8c8g00ks8gocdl721raael4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bt7xim98ds84swsogk4ww8wwcgc4skcis4b2f6l3a0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.3.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 10\r\nBrowser: | Brave for android\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2026911096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-29T09:03:23Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Media\r\nAdGuard Annoyances\r\n```\r\nNote that you can exchange AdGuard Annoyances for new filters if you want to block only some annoyances.\r\nFor instance, `AdGuard Cookie Notices` + `AdGuard Popups` instead of the `AdGuard Annoyances`.\r\nI'd also suggest to enable `Browser security` in the app settings for blocking phishing sites.\r\n\r\n> Language-specific: EasyList Hebrew, Liste

`AdGuard Mobile Ads` - this filter is redundant for desktop, but it's necessary for mobile platforms.\r\n\r\n> Location Sharing: I prefer to manage location permissions on a per-website

[#175931 (comment)](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175931#issuecomment-2027035311) yep, that's enough. I've added the rule, update should be available in 2-3 hours. Thank you for checking this out!\r\n\r\n@zloyden, I'm seeking advice on optimizing my AdGuard settings for macOS. My priority is convenience and speed, but I also want a reasonable level of privacy. Here are my preferences:\r\n\r\n1. **Privacy vs. Convenience**: I lean towards convenience but still value privacy.\r\n2. **Website Functionality**: I'm okay with disabling unnecessary functionalities for privacy.\r\n3. **Notifications**: I don't need website notifications; I use PWAs for that.\r\n4. **Location Sharing**: I prefer to manage location permissions on a per-website basis.\r\n5. **Tracking**: It's essential to prevent tracking through cookies and other methods.\r\n6. **Anonymity**: Masking my digital fingerprint is very important to me.\r\n\r\nConsidering these points, should I enable mobile-specific filters like \"AdGuard Mobile App Banners\" and \"AdGuard Mobile Ads\" if I mainly access desktop sites? Here's my current configuration:\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\n| Information | Value |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| AdGuard product | AdGuard for Mac v2.13.0.1558 release |\r\n| System version | macOS Sonoma 14.4.1 |\r\n| Browser | Safari |\r\n| Stealth mode options | Block Push API, Block Location API, Block Java, Strip URLs from tracking parameters, Hide your search queries, Send Do-Not-Track header, Hide your Referrer from third-parties, Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), Block third-party Authorization header, Block trackers |\r\n| DNS filtering | AdGuard DNS-over-QUIC |\r\n| Filters | **Ad Blocking:** AdGuard Base, AdGuard Mobile Ads<br>**Privacy:** AdGuard Tracking Protection, AdGuard URL Tracking<br>**Social Widgets:** AdGuard Social Media<br>**Annoyances:** AdGuard Annoyances, AdGuard Cookie Notices, AdGuard Popups, AdGuard Mobile App Banners, AdGuard Other Annoyances, AdGuard Widgets, Adblock Warning Removal List<br>**Security:** Online Malicious URL Blocklist, NoCoin Filter List<br>**Language-specific:** EasyList Hebrew, Liste AR |\r\n| Userscripts | disabled |\r\n| Other extensions used | only AdGuard ad blocker |\r\n\r\nCould you provide guidance on whether this setup is appropriate or if adjustments are needed to better align with my preferences? Thank you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2027051165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-29T10:38:51Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

On this website, this placeholder will not be hidden no matter what. Why is this happening? I believe the rule updates are working properly.

Comment\r\n> На этом сайте присутствует рекламные баннеры (но мне они не мешают), конкретно обращаюсь из-за присутствия рекламы при воспроизведении видео (аниме). и поэтому нужно ждать пока реклама пройдет, чтобы посмотреть. в течение всего периода, что пользуюсь AdGuardом он перерывно блокировал рекламу при воспроизведении видео на этом сайте (в общем то работал, то не работал). сейчас снова перестал работать, поэтому решила обратиться к вам.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
