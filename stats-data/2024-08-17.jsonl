Comment\r\n> Hello,\r\n> \r\n> I am experiencing an issue with the TTAutoRecord repository when my AdGuard software is enabled. I am using the stable version 7.18.1 (4778) with a lifetime license for three devices. When AdGuard is active, I receive the following errors:\r\n> \r\n>     ERROR - Error processing [username]: Message: Tried to run command without establishing a connection\r\n>     WebDriverException occurred: Message: Failed to decode response from marionette\r\n> \r\n> These errors seem to indicate a connection or communication problem, and I suspect this might be related to AdGuard. Could you please confirm if AdGuard could be causing these issues? If so, do you have any recommendations for resolving this conflict?\r\n> \r\n> Thank you in advance for your assistance.\r\nUsername: `@FabLeKebab`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/a6bmj1fmtq0wo048ckgc48kwwow440wr392rujhpao.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4wtvl6n8i0sgs4k0s00kgwcw0k88cowg11mpk3p014.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.18.1\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11, Version 23H2 \r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Google Public DNS`<br>filters: `https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/adguard-filters/`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Import issue configuration (AdGuard for Windows)\r\n[Import](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=adguard%3Aimport_user_configuration%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252FCoombaa%252FTTAutoRecord)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185352/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2294898773","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185352#issuecomment-2294898773","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185352","id":2294898773,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86IyWBV","user":{"login":"FabLeKebab","id":109556581,"node_id":"U_kgDOBoezZQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109556581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab","html_url":"https://github.com/FabLeKebab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-17T15:59:27Z","updated_at":"2024-08-17T15:59:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello, sorry for the late reply, I just left it on with DNS enabled on Google and so far no crashes.
