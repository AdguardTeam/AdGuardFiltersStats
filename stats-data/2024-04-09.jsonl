SSAI ads seem to get through on phones, but I'm not sure why it's different from a useragent switch in the browser. I guess you could start checking the logger for the `yospace` domain and see if there are any m3u8 playlists from that domain, then test various m3u-prune combinations. On desktop they just seem to be ordinary mp4 files which are just ads and nothing else. `.mp4` in the filter could probably be replaced by a more specific path.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2045799083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-09T18:01:48Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
