Restarting the browser helps for a moment at most. Disabling every extension aside from Adguard Browser Assistant doesn't seem to do anything either. Restarting my PC has helped, but the issue comes back as it always does. \r\n> \r\n> I've been using Adguard for a long time now, and it hasn't always had this issue. I'm pretty sure it's something that's only started to happen with one of the latest stable update releases, maybe the last one (I'm on 7.11.3 currently).\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/bo9MhvF.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/XPDGiSX.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/SAMVrkP.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11.3\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block WebRTC\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/windows/filters/15.txt, User+rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Hungarian, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Anti-virus software: Bitdefender Internet Security.

AdGuard Filters and AdGuard Home) see pretty much no maintenance nor processing on weekends. If someone files an issue report on a Friday afternoon, they're pretty much never looked into before Mondays 10:00 CET at earliest.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nHire additional (or change the working days of some existing) AdGuard employees or contractors, for the primary purpose of making AdGuard products maintained 7 days a week instead of just 5.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI know uBlock Origin is pretty much a 7-days-a-week project that could be used as a de facto example to compare with, even if they are a non-profit group. On the other hand, I'm not 100% sure about Eyeo's workdays.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/137729/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/137729/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-12-21T15:59:50Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
