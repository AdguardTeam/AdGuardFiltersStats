Restarting the browser helps for a moment at most. Disabling every extension aside from Adguard Browser Assistant doesn't seem to do anything either. Restarting my PC has helped, but the issue comes back as it always does. \r\n> \r\n> I've been using Adguard for a long time now, and it hasn't always had this issue. I'm pretty sure it's something that's only started to happen with one of the latest stable update releases, maybe the last one (I'm on 7.11.3 currently).\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/bo9MhvF.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/XPDGiSX.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/SAMVrkP.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11.3\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block WebRTC\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/windows/filters/15.txt, User+rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Hungarian, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Anti-virus software: Bitdefender Internet Security.
