disappointed by the things that are happening, I can no longer be anxiety free because of the things that happens when a ad appears on the Spotify. The Ad Guard does block the ad, but the issue is that the Spotify freezes and doesn't let the next music play. i hope you will look into it and try to understand what the problem is and fix it.
