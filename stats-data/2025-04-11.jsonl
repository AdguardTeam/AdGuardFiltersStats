Brave's built-in adblocker does not work on Facebook.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/lear9d6mam84w8ogk8co48c8c80kwwkcu368pa2kxw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6u4h8k2o15wk0c400w4csgos0www00smm8iw2s12k0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/41lyi7d5d604socc8co0o8kowg0o08ghnhz7ozvjpw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.0.219 MV3\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11\r\nBrowser: | Brave\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2795769870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-11T03:52:44Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

you for linking to the previous discussion.\n\nSo just to make sure I understand, the \"anti-adblock advertising\" supersedes the overall policies regarding ads ?\n\nI'm specifically referring to this part:\n\n> Our general stance here is very similar to the EasyList policy regarding self-promotion ads. According to our [filter policy](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/filter-policy/), we should not block these ads; however, we should not make an exception if such an ad gets blocked by some rule 'alongside' a regular ad.\n\nJust for the sake of saving time, here's EasyList's policy regarding self-promotion: \n\n> Self-promotion (any type of advertising that promotes goods or services that are owned or operated by the domain owner and doesn’t get commercially compensated for by third parties (examples can include new features, new posts, newsletters, subscriptions to printed media products, merchandise etc.)) won't be targeted directly.\n\nThe filter I suggested does block the self-promotion \"'alongside' a regular ad\" (per definition, I consider regular ads the 1st party \"user ads\" that redirect to a commercial website)\n\nI understand that users are reporting those ads (note that only the 1st and 3rd reports actually report self-promotion), but that's kind of a fallacy (I'd liken it to a survivorship bias), since you don't take into account the people who want to see those \"user ads\" / \"self promotion\" (disclaimer, I'm one of those).\n\nIf the \"Anti-adblock advertising\" policy has priority over the self-promotion exception, then that's fine I guess. I just want to clarify things.\n\nThank you again !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2796473657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-11T10:12:48Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I'm from Royal Road and we are willing to work with you for the benefit of the AdGuard community and the site. \n\nWhy not set it so that those with AdGuard can only view internal ads? as in ads that link directly to the platform itself and not third party?\n\nIt's basically book recommendations at that point and it's a feature our users are interested in. \n\nIn fact our ads are popular enough that if you get a paid premium subscription then you can enable viewing those ads and those ads only, due to popular request. \n\nThose ads also have no user tracking, and they don’t load external scripts. We only count the total clicks with no user tracking involved, and we serve them randomly. \n\nIf even ads like these can't be allowed on the internet, then what chance does the internet have to remain available for free for users? \n\nWe have modified our script so that in the presence of an ad blocker, we only attempt to load ads that point at stories on the website.

No contiene trackers ni realiza peticiones externas; solo verifica localmente si hay Warp usando el mismo endpoint de Cloudflare del sitio y muestra un aviso cerrable que solo enlaza a one.one.one.one (página oficial de Cloudflare). El script está alojado en warpe.pages.dev (Cloudflare Pages, solo contenido estático) y el dominio war.pe apunta ahí. El bloqueo afecta una función útil, segura y transparente. Este script no tiene que ver con la situación mostrada en este commit ni con ningún tipo de publicidad, simplemente recomienda al usuario el servicio gratuito de Cloudflare, por favor revisar para considerar revertirlo. \n\n _Originally posted by @war-pe in [#202464](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/202464#issuecomment-2796686188)_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/202914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/202914/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-11T15:59:54Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
