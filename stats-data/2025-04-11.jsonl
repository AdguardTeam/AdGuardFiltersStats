Comment\r\n> Facebook gives me popups when I am looking at facebook without being logged in a Facebook account to create a new account. Sometimes, these popups are not able to be closed and most of the time it makes the Facebook content not load when adguard is on. Brave's built-in adblocker does not work on Facebook.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/lear9d6mam84w8ogk8co48c8c80kwwkcu368pa2kxw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6u4h8k2o15wk0c400w4csgos0www00smm8iw2s12k0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/41lyi7d5d604socc8co0o8kowg0o08ghnhz7ozvjpw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.0.219 MV3\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11\r\nBrowser: | Brave\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2795769870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-11T03:52:44Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
