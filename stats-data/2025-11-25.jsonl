Install AdGuard on Android.\r\n> 2. Use default settings (no HTTPS filtering enabled).\r\n> 3. Test ad blocking performance → ~70–80% of ads are blocked.\r\n> 4. Enable **HTTPS filtering**.\r\n> 5. Install and trust the **AdGuard CA certificate**.\r\n> 6. Test ad blocking performance again → blocking drops to <50%.\r\n> \r\n> Expected Behavior: Enabling HTTPS filtering should increase or at least maintain the level of ad blocking, not reduce it.\r\n> \r\n> Actual Behavior: After enabling HTTPS filtering, the number of unblocked ads increases, reducing overall effectiveness.\r\n> \r\n```\r\nUsername: @Sandeepxi\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/46ylmpvmjg4kwo48oks8k4g4o408gs0aoqu5un9fbs.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.10\r\nSystem version: | `Android 13`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Cloudflare `<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental, <br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>ABPindo, <br/>EasyList China, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Dutch, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>EasyList Germany, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>ROList, <br/>Icelandic ABP List, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>Liste FR, <br/>Greek AdBlock Filter, <br/>EasyList Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>Xfiles, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>Polish GDPR-Cookies Filters, <br/>Estonian List, <br/>CJX's Annoyances List, <br/>Polish Social Filters, <br/>List-KR, <br/>xinggsf, <br/>EasyList Spanish, <br/>KAD -

Test ad blocking performance again → blocking drops to <50%.\r\n> \r\n> Expected Behavior: Enabling HTTPS filtering should increase or at least maintain the level of ad blocking, not reduce it.\r\n> \r\n> Actual Behavior: After enabling HTTPS filtering, the number of unblocked ads increases, reducing overall effectiveness.\r\n> \r\n```\r\nUsername: @Sandeepxi\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/46ylmpvmjg4kwo48oks8k4g4o408gs0aoqu5un9fbs.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.10\r\nSystem version: | `Android 13`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Cloudflare `<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental, <br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>ABPindo, <br/>EasyList China, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Dutch, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>EasyList Germany, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>ROList, <br/>Icelandic ABP List, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>Liste FR, <br/>Greek AdBlock Filter, <br/>EasyList Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>Xfiles, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>Polish GDPR-Cookies Filters, <br/>Estonian List, <br/>CJX's Annoyances List, <br/>Polish Social Filters, <br/>List-KR, <br/>xinggsf, <br/>EasyList Spanish, <br/>KAD - Anti-Scam, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>ROLIST2, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>road-block, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>YousList, <br/>Polish Annoyances Filters, <br/>EasyList Polish, <br/>Polish Anti-Annoying Special Supplement, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Serbo-Croatian List, <br/>IndianList, <br/>Macedonian adBlock Filters</details>\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=and&product_version=4.10&system_version=Android+13&browser=chrome&filters=2.11.101.3.17.118.204.225.251.4.123.14.18.19.20.21.22.207.122.241.250.208.255.256.257.5.10.15.239.1.6.7.8.9.13.16.23.103.102.104.105.106.108.109.110.107.111.114.119.120.112.113.121.124.202.203.206.216.212.214.217.218.220.221.224.227.228.231.232.233.234.235.236.238.243.244.237.246.247.249.252.253.254&dns_servers=Cloudflare+&android.mode=VPN&android.system_root=false&dns.filters_enabled=false&dns.enabled=true&https.filtering=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false&license_type=paid)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/218736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/218736/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-11-25T06:12:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

The script must include the following features:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Authentication: Accept a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) as a command-line argument or environment variable.\r\n> 2. Safety Mode: Include a \"dry-run\" flag that defaults to True. If enabled, list what would happen without actually merging anything.\r\n> 3.

Install AdGuard on Android.\r\n> 2. Use default settings (no HTTPS filtering enabled).\r\n> 3. Test ad blocking performance → ~70–80% of ads are blocked.\r\n> 4. Enable **HTTPS filtering**.\r\n> 5.

Test ad blocking performance again → blocking drops to <50%.\r\n> \r\n> Expected Behavior: Enabling HTTPS filtering should increase or at least maintain the level of ad blocking, not reduce it.\r\n> \r\n> Actual Behavior: After enabling HTTPS filtering, the number of unblocked ads increases, reducing overall effectiveness.\r\n> \r\n```\r\nUsername: @Sandeepxi\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/46ylmpvmjg4kwo48oks8k4g4o408gs0aoqu5un9fbs.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.10\r\nSystem version: | `Android 13`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Cloudflare `<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental, <br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>ABPindo, <br/>EasyList China, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Dutch, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>EasyList Germany, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>ROList, <br/>Icelandic ABP List, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>Liste FR, <br/>Greek AdBlock Filter, <br/>EasyList Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>Xfiles, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>Polish GDPR-Cookies Filters, <br/>Estonian List, <br/>CJX's Annoyances List, <br/>Polish Social Filters, <br/>List-KR, <br/>xinggsf, <br/>EasyList Spanish, <br/>KAD -
