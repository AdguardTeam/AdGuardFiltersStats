( [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing#264](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing/issues/264) )\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n> Please check that there no another web browser extension that has adblocking feature is enabled on your web browser. It can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \r\n> Saving memory feature of your web browser or sleep feature of your operating system can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n> In this case, please re-enable AdGuard's filtering by toggling the protection toggle.\r\n> Following the instructions can be needed.\r\n\r\n### The instructions\r\n1. Force to update the filters by clicking the reload button in AdGuard Browser Extension/AdGuard mobile or update tray menu in your system tray. [^2]\r\n2. Reload the YouTube webpage without cache by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> [^3].\r\n3. Clear cache, cookies and site data of your web browser.\r\n4. Re-open your web browser completely (checking your system monitor[^4] will be better).\r\n\r\n[^1]: https://gitlab.com/adblockinc/ext/adblockplus/adblockplusui/-/issues/1576\r\n[^2]: [AdGuard for Windows](https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-windows/overview/#tray-menu); [AdGuard for Mac](https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-mac/overview/#updates-check); \r\n[^3]: On macOS, <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>\r\n[^4]: Task Manager on Windows, System Monitor on GNOME Shell, KDE System Guard on KDE Plasma or Activity Monitor on macOS. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172033/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1987788733","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172033#issuecomment-1987788733","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172033","id":1987788733,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM852ez-9","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-11T07:36:27Z","updated_at":"2024-03-11T07:36:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [https://www.youtube.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Not blocking ads on youtube in video player and well as when on the homepage/search\r\nUsername: `@Vany227`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/k5ndpm8h0nk8g4wowogw0ko8w4owckcnrozn90ad28.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.16.0 (4542)\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/windows/filters/15.txt`, `User rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Dutch\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1987788733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-11T07:36:28Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Safari saying that the page load was blocked by a content filter.\r\n> \r\n> I have this domain whitelisted in AdGuard (via unticking the 'disable on this website') tick box and I can see the domain

Просто не нашел раздела, куда эту задачу отправить. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/j99kvb11snwwkw08g84og888gso4gkwc00gmbqb9hk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tjkw3f55juo4skw0wssco0kww8wocssjokj4but65c.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.4 Nightly 34\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Firefox для мобильных устройств\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Block Push API, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (https://yandex.ru/search/touch/?text=), <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (1), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>I don't care about cookies<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nCustom filters: | https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/bitblock.txt\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174229/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1988285753","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174229#issuecomment-1988285753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174229","id":1988285753,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM852gtU5","user":{"login":"jellizaveta","id":91964807,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXtFhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91964807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta","html_url":"https://github.com/jellizaveta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-11T12:04:18Z","updated_at":"2024-03-11T12:04:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Задача перенаправлена в соответствующий [репозиторий](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/DisableAMP/issues/94) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1988285753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-11T12:04:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
