The page displays  normally with the annoyance filters enabled if I type the website (nj.com) manually into the Chrome address bar and then search for the article. If I click a link in the Google Discover feed, which is where I usually find the articles I'm trying to read, instead of getting the popup I had been seeing saying that an ad locker had been detected, I'm now getting a blank white screen. It's blank in the Google app and when I try to open the link in Chrome. If I disable the annoyance filters and click the link, I go back to seeing the notice the ad locker has been detected on both the Google app and Chrome browser. Since this is also the case for ticket 182157 (I just made a new report on that ticket), I'm assuming it is the same for tickets 182340, 182176 and 181350 as well. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/gabz3eoeruo04okkkc8skksssskk400cu68si2vnag.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.5\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Eset security ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2197853386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-29T02:03:25Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
