half the questions you ask .  all i know is i am being redirected  to flixhive no matter what i do  all scans have come up empty when i did blaco the ad  the redirect still happesn but now the player is gone and just the sound. cant keep adblocker or ad guard enabled   not very please with this new easy simple internet its  harder than turning on a pc in 1979 and i know please make this simple and for non  developer people to fiull out.  btw java and flash are bad ideas and the reason i use a desk top and not  amobiel of some sort is because mobiels  dont block ads they take over your phone and you never get any rest. now  its being made to where you cant use the pc with out adds we already pay for  the internet and power and parts and os and everything else.  why are we all forced to see ads and  stuff when we already pay for  internet i understand paying for your service if i could afford it but  after paying to use the internet there is no money left\r\nUsername: `@dont have one

(This is important for multiple reasons, including that people may need to know when the page has been modified so they can look for the changed content on the page.)\r\n\r\nFor a large number of those webpages, the \"Date modified\" line is stripped out by three popular filter lists for uBlock Origin:\r\n\r\n* AdGuard - Social Widgets\r\n\r\n* EasyList - Social Widgets\r\n\r\n* Fanboy's Annoyance List\r\n\r\n(I confirmed each had that effect with careful one-by-one process of elimination.)\r\n\r\nThis is on Chrome and Edge for Windows, fully updated with updated extensions and filters.\r\n\r\nHere are examples of two high-level webpages on which this occurs:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/services/culture.html\r\n\r\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/services/jobs.html\r\n\r\n(I have already reported this on the Lanik forums to request action on the same problem in the EasyList and Fanboy filters.)\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.\r\n\r\n3.
