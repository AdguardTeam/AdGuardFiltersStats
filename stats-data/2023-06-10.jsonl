Comment\r\n> Возможно, AdGuard ошибочно относит данную информацию к рекламе. Однако, на самом деле, когда пользователь самостоятельно переходит в карточку организации, это говорит о том, что ему нужна информация об этой организации. В карточке можно найти различные данные, такие как услуги, акции и другую информацию. Как пользователю, мне важна эта информация, именно то, что AdGuard скрывает, я и хочу увидеть.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9QM4MXl.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/f7oIxPB.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.13.1\r\nBrowser: | Yandex\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://ya.ru/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fya.ru%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | Kaspersky Security Cloud","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/153228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/153228/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1585805747","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/153228#issuecomment-1585805747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/153228","id":1585805747,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85ehXmz","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-10T20:26:38Z","updated_at":"2023-06-10T20:26:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Ads)\r\n[NSFW] [https://yandex.ru/maps/24/veliky-novgorod/?ll=31.269813%2C58.522856&z=12](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyandex.ru%2Fmaps%2F24%2Fveliky-novgorod%2F%3Fll%3D31.269813%252C58.522856%26z%3D12)\r\n### Comment\r\n> На яндекс картах показывается реклама\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/BYb5iw2.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.56\r\nBrowser: | Opera\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters\r\nOther extensions used: | Ghostery, Adguard extra","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1585805747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-06-10T20:26:39Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
