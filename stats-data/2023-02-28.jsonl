Comment\r\n> Не нашел настроек (семейных dns фильтров блокирующих взрослый (режим для детского телефона) контент) при котором не появлялись в поисковике, а тем более не могли открываются сайты со взрослым контентом. В приложении очень много профессиональных терминов/настроек. Наверное это хорошо, но для рядового пользователя хотелось бы иметь и изи режим - предустановленные присеты, \"детский телефон\"/\"без взрослого контента\",  а также когда находясь на непотребном сайте кликнув в adguard по кнопке \"добавить в заблокированные\". Для отправки сообщения в техподдержку опять же много вопросов. Правильней сделать кнопку отправить/экспорт настроек программы с информацией о системе/браузере/настройках браузера в техподдержку. А в общем спасибо за программу. \r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/DFV16aT.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/DFV16aT.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 7.1.2\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.0.630\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | proxy\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash, <br>Block Java, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (), <br>Hide your User-Agent ()\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1447687584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-28T07:08:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Не нашел настроек (семейных dns фильтров блокирующих взрослый (режим для детского телефона) контент) при котором не появлялись в поисковике, а тем более не могли открываются сайты со взрослым

В приложении очень много профессиональных терминов/настроек. Наверное это хорошо, но для рядового пользователя хотелось бы иметь и изи режим - предустановленные присеты, \"детский телефон\"/\"без взрослого контента\", а также когда находясь на непотребном сайте кликнув в adguard по кнопке \"добавить в заблокированные\". Для отправки сообщения в техподдержку опять же много вопросов. Правильней сделать кнопку отправить/экспорт настроек программы с информацией о системе/браузере/настройках браузера в техподдержку.
