Post website, nypost.com, no longer shows the comment section when AdGuard is enabled. I turned off all extra filters to see if they were causing the issue, but the issue still persists. In addition to Safari, the issue also occurs in Chrome and Brave. I don't use Firefox. However, Opera browser's own built-in ad protection does allow the comment section to load properly. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/ptzdC61.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/MBFmiJE.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.10.1.1277\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | None ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/153156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/153156/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-06-08T10:18:22Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
