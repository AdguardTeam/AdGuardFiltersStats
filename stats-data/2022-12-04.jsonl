hides/blurs the video frame while AdGuard is enabled (the audio component continues to play properly). When AdGuard is disabled, the video works again, although there are of course advertisements. It appears that YouTube is aware that there is a blocker working, and willfully blurs out the video to force the user to disable the blocker and see the ads. Note: I am not sure which filters I have enabled, so I only selected \"AdGuard base filter\" for the purposes of submitting this report.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/jmOjqC9.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/D06hcM7.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.46\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nOther extensions used: | DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1336408868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-12-04T13:12:53Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I already tried refreshing filters and leaving it for one minute after it was finished updating. I also disabled all filters for a minute in safari settings re enabled all of it after one minute. Issue can be reproduced on an iPad Mini 2 on iOS 12.5.6 and iPhone 7 Plus iOS 14.8. Please check with older iOS versions.
