Your comment\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/cname-trackers/master/data/ads/ad-shield.txt` is not catching up their changes. uBO has been using a regex for a while ([initial commit](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/commit/a2de6614f0aa68eb6bfb62037bfd5245185d61e1)) which successfully blocked them on `bbs.animanch.com` (mobile-only) yesterday, but at the time AG failed ([fixed](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/commit/224db4f958c47fba75e18603e44683ce40302242) already). I think in practice the form in this PR is enough which is safer and thus can omit `$header` in the uBO rule.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not

Clicking \"Verify you are human\" does nothing, just loops and then resets.  I've had this on a few websites that randomly check on page load, but some website will do a bot check each time an action is taken. In my case, namely https://domains.cloudflare.com/ and https://dropped.uk/. Initiating a domain search prompts the human check, and the verification button doesn't work until AdGuard is turned off, either entirely or just for this site.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/md20bkph2ggo8kc0kwg88co4o488csg3k85sittfas.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ece42faxz6gcssg80c84gg0ws4okkw82r4fn9fm534.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.1 (4966)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.22631.0\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (dropped.uk), <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.controld.com/nh3tb8lvh0`<br>filters: `User rules (url: none)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nCustom filters: | User rules (url: none),<br>NoCoin Filter List (url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list/master/nocoin.txt)\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29%2CNoCoin%2520Filter%2520List%2520%28url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fhoshsadiq%2Fadblock-nocoin-list%2Fmaster%2Fnocoin.txt%29&dns.custom_bootstrap=&dns.custom_fallback=&dns.custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_mode=System&dns.filters=&dns.servers=https%3A%2F%2Fdns.controld.com%2Fnh3tb8lvh0&dns.timeout=0&extensions=&extensions.enabled=true&filters=10.122.204.207.208.225.251&license_type=paid&product_type=Win&product_version=7.20.1+%284966%29&scheme_version=2&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_third_party_auth=false&stealth.block_trackers=false&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=true&stealth.disable_wap_push_message_routing_service=false&stealth.disable_windows_defender=false&stealth.disable_windows_telemetry=true&stealth.dpi=true&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.flash=false&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.java=false&stealth.location=false&stealth.push=false&stealth.referrer=dropped.uk&stealth.strip_url=true&stealth.third_party_cookies=180&stealth.turn_off_advertising_id=true&stealth.user_agent=&stealth.webrtc=true&stealth.x_client=true&system_version=Microsoft+Windows+NT+10.0.22631.0&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F133.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36+Edg%2F133.0.0.0&win.wfp=true)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200005/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-04T12:21:40Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

DNS过滤器禁止了，所以这个软件就会通过IP绕过封禁，从url内容可以知道这是用于跟踪的，会上传操作系统信息，软件版本号等等。我就通过禁止IP来阻挡，当然还有另一种方法，为了方便，假设host后面的域名为A。 `||*A*`  这条规则能拦截下面的url，我试过了，并且对软件使用没有任何不利影响。我推荐使用通配符。\n我建议将新规则添加到Adguard DNS过滤器和Adguard 防跟踪过滤器中。host后面的域名已经被你的DNS过滤器拦截，你们只需要在原有的规则上加上 `*`\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b7436f4-5f06-4c65-b6e6-74ce22a33884)\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this

DNS过滤器禁止了，所以这个软件就会通过IP绕过封禁，从url内容可以知道这是用于跟踪的，会上传操作系统信息，软件版本号等等。我就通过禁止IP来阻挡，当然还有另一种方法，为了方便，假设host后面的域名为A。 `||*A*`  这条规则能拦截下面的url，我试过了，并且对软件使用没有任何不利影响。我推荐使用通配符。\n我建议将新规则添加到Adguard DNS过滤器和Adguard 防跟踪过滤器中。host后面的域名已经被你的DNS过滤器拦截，你们只需要在原有的规则上加上 `*`\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b7436f4-5f06-4c65-b6e6-74ce22a33884)\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this

DNS过滤器禁止了，所以这个软件就会通过IP绕过封禁，从url内容可以知道这是用于跟踪的，会上传操作系统信息，软件版本号等等。我就通过禁止IP来阻挡，当然还有另一种方法，为了方便，假设host后面的域名为A。 `||*A*`  这条规则能拦截下面的url，我试过了，并且对软件使用没有任何不利影响。我推荐使用通配符。\n我建议将新规则添加到Adguard DNS过滤器和Adguard 防跟踪过滤器中。host后面的域名已经被你的DNS过滤器拦截，你们只需要在原有的规则上加上 `*`\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b7436f4-5f06-4c65-b6e6-74ce22a33884)\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this
