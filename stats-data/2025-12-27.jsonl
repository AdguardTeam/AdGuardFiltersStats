Adguarad DNS no bloquea los anucios en algunas aplicaciones, tales como Terabox, 7 minutos entre otras, anexé la captura.\r\n> \r\n> . Ninguna de las Direcciones de servidores DNS cifradas aceptó en la configuracion directa en Android, en cambio las direccion correspondiente de NextDNS sí acepta bien.\r\n> \r\n> Por favor mejoren el bloqueo en Adguard DNS, que sea comparable quizá con NextDNS.  Adguard DNS me gusta porque tiene un panel de control que puedo eliminar dispositivos, pero falta mucho para ser bueno.\r\n> \r\n> Hago pruebas, porque quiero ofrecer mi Servicios de Asesoria en uso de Aplicaciones para bloqueo de anuncios a usuarios en general.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @ExplorerAS\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/odjop8wkf28wsgsgoowws8owccg0goc683obqncuuo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/39ly0tbtkk00ccwg08ogw00g8g8cosk6y64uu6qjho.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/boiyitjtw204o4o8cso8o88gs4wgws4h1y1v1jhmrk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/h77hv8aj6ggs8cc0gg4kgwkogkokg4k6srapogd2wc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | C5GEmisor\r\nDNS server: | Private AdGuard DNS server\r\nSystem version: | `Android`\r\nBrowser: | se de la aplicacion movil de terabox en android\r\nBlocklists: | <b>General:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nCustom filters: | `https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221223/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-12-27T08:05:11Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
