But when i disable ad base filter then Brave Shields working without any issue. But i do not want to disable ag base filter for this one issue.\r\n> \r\n> Step to reproduce the issue :- Go to brave shields > set it to Aggressive > then go to custom filter > import ag base filter from this link https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/ublock/filters/2_without_easylist.txt then open the inbox of mail.com. you will see the blank frame. But if you disable the ag base filter then shields will block the blank frame successfully.\r\n> \r\n> Possible solution :- add this filter ' mail.*##html.can-have-sky .page-body > .section-content:style(margin-right: 0 !important;) ' to ag base filter list.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/nj2jqtc4q4gws00c4gkwggk8ow8sg4jpwvahnhpc00.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Brave Shields\r\nBrowser: | Brave Browser\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163333/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-10-07T07:17:01Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
