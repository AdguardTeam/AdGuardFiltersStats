@Grandpat-Star\r\n> When I try to watch the official music video for Strawberry Wine by Deana Carter Official the adblock has not worked since last night. I have tried reloading and ads show up. When I have tried reloading other videos such as Introducing LEGO Braille Bricks – Play with Braille by Lego official, and the official audio for The Wrong Girl (Greatest Hits Version) by Lee Ann Womack Official the ads are not there. This seems to be contained to this specific video.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ghclp6szi9s0c8woscogs0w80og0ggsds7aguah22o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tfx68g4v7tw4wkkg0g0s44go0o88sc4dmcps04vezs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nOther extensions used: | Duck Duck Go Privacy Essentials, Return Youtube Disklike Button, Youtube-shorts block, CustomTube, and Replace Youtube's Home with Subscriptions","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-24T13:29:35Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
