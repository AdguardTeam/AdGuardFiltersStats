Comment\r\n> Hello AdGuard team,\r\n> \r\n> I operate a website where I freely share my own original designs, which I hold all legal rights to. Instead of selling these resources, I provide them for free to a wide range of industries and creators, including with free commercial licenses for production use.\r\n> \r\n> However, I have noticed that AdGuard is applying aggressive filter rules to my site, which break core site functionality and prevent users from benefiting from these resources. What is especially concerning is that my site is being grouped under the same filter rules as adult content sites and illegal streaming domains. This unfairly impacts a legitimate resource intended for professionals, educators, and makers.\r\n> \r\n> I have already removed any adblock detection scripts from my website to avoid conflicts.\r\n> \r\n> Here are the filters currently affecting my domains:\r\n> \r\n> Element: <script>\r\n> Rule applied:\r\n> s0ft4pc.com,templatesarea.com,...#$#body > * { filter: none !important; }\r\n> Element: <a class=\"skip-link screen-reader-text\" href=\"#content\">\r\n> Rule applied:\r\n> s0ft4pc.com,templatesarea.com,...#$#body > * { filter: none !important; }\r\n> Element: <div id=\"boxed-wrapper\">\r\n> Rule applied:\r\n> s0ft4pc.com,templatesarea.com,...#$#body > * { filter: none !important; }\r\n> Element: <a class=\"fusion-one-page-text-link fusion-page-load-link\" ...>\r\n> Rule applied:\r\n> s0ft4pc.com,templatesarea.com,...#$#body > * { filter: none !important; }\r\n> Element: <div class=\"avada-footer-scripts\">\r\n> Rule applied:\r\n> s0ft4pc.com,templatesarea.com,...#$#body > * { filter: none !important; }\r\n> Element: <section class=\"to-top-container to-top-right to-top-floating\" ...>\r\n> Rule applied:\r\n> s0ft4pc.com,templatesarea.com,...#$#body > * { filter: none !important; }\r\n> These filters are not only blocking ads—they are disabling essential functionality and damaging the user experience for tens of thousands of people who rely on these free resources. Treating my site the same way as adult and illegal content sites is both inappropriate and unfair.\r\n> \r\n> If these rules are not removed, I will have no choice but to close the site and discontinue the free commercial licenses that currently benefit a wide audience across many industries. My next project will only provide access to paying customers.\r\n> \r\n> At the moment, I have stopped uploading new designs and am pausing my work while awaiting your response. Please consider removing these filters for my domains so that I can continue providing free, high-quality resources to everyone.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you for your attention and understanding.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hiqmx23zzjswwk4oc8sckkcos80kgsw7zit2pvjonw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/29i1fue86p34s8cwgsg8s4skg08kkcgsjfevyqrgao.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.102 MV2\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Turkish\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209285/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-14T02:51:57Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> adguard导致百度百科中的媒体载入失败。 \r\n> 可以看到在启用了adguard之后整个页面的图片都无法载入，禁用后正常.在过滤日志中可以清晰看到** AdGuard反跟踪保护过滤器 **中的“||eclick.baidu.com^”阻止了数次图片请求，在添加了用户规则放行后网页又一次恢复正常。我的问题是明明eclick.baidu.com就是百度的广告域名，为什么阻止之后会导致网页异常？这很难让人不去联系是不是某些大厂阻止用户拦截广告的举措。请Adguard团队尽快予以修正并及时让我了解到你们的进展，谢谢！\r\n```\r\nUsername:

description\n\nUnder false assumption of meaningful consent from a browser user Mellowtel enables a scheme where an unauthorized proxy is installed as browser extension to fetch arbitrary data over
