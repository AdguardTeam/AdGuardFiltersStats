Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://youtube.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n>  Request #783180\r\n> \r\n> Hi, we're having issues with youtube no longer giving us the option to see the description boxes within videos. We have family dns enabled to block ads...however we have not had issues with this until a few days ago after new iPhone update. We are running latest updates on iPhone, adguard, and safari. Issues are all when adguard enabled only. When you select \"more\" at bottom of youtube video, description box pops up, however the description does not come up any longer. This happens on different videos that I know have descriptions available for viewing. Running ios 16.5.1(c) \r\n> If I turn adguard off in safari under settings and through the app, then YouTube descriptions are visible. For some reason, they are no longer visible when you select \"more\" in a YouTube video underneath the video if adguard is enabled. I'm unable to see the Video description or links in youtube if adguard is on. This did not happen before latest ios update. I have provided two photos for examples. When you click on \"more\" the description and links will normally pop up for you to view, however, if I have adguard enabled the descriptions no longer pop up for viewing.  I have attached a photo to show adguard  enabled, and you cannot see the description, and then a screenshot with AdGuard disabled, and you can then see the description like we slways had been able to say with our family DNS filtering in YouTube has blocked. This was never an issue before the latest iOS update. We want to continue to have the ability to use AdGuard without having to disable it to view YouTube descriptions.\r\n> please help, thank you...Charlene\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/9cfu2ugqlh4wso4gcoscg4ws0w4oooshvdkabcuw2o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2awqi6e2z3i8soggcg8440k04sgs0o0pitsb515gyo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.5.0\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://family.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nOther extensions used: | Using latest ios 16.5.1 (c)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157138/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1647188126","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157138#issuecomment-1647188126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157138","id":1647188126,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85iLhie","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-24T04:27:22Z","updated_at":"2023-07-24T04:27:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Anti Adblock Script)\r\n [https://youtube.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> This is good idea. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jyx8kc5d0sgw0o8w4k888w0ggkss8c4fqc416xralc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nStealth mode options: | \r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1647188126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-24T04:27:22Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
