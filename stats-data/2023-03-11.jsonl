facebook android app is messed up. when adguard is on, the share button doesn't work, i see 4x more ads than before, ignoring ads is stuck, and comments doesn't applying to posts.\r\n> plus there is another thing. the last months or maybe a year now, when i am working on pc(chrome or mozilla or any other browser) and i am searching for a subject on google search everything is fine untill i press the \"images\" option  under the search line to see relevant pictures. then the browser stuck or loading for a long time without results. then i right click adguard on the bottom right and choose deactivation of adguard for 30 seconds and the image search is working, but I have to do that 60 to 100 times every day for every single search, please fix it\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n
