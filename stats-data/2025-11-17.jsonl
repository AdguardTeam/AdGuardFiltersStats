This is an issue with AdGuard DNS Family Safety specifically, as it does not occur with the standard AdGuard DNS, and the same problem happens even on PCs.\r\n> \r\n> ## Steps to Reproduce\r\n> 1.  Set the DNS settings within the AdGuard app to AdGuard DNS Family Safety (During this setup, I use the QUIC protocol.)\r\n> 2.  Access the specified website.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/43mvlxxli7uoco0wc4kwoo8cg848kw4lssz69256xw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/kaqmgtg8g5c4gckg48sowo888ck44kknj26h39u6mo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.12.1\r\nSystem version: | `Android 16`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://family.adguard-dns.com`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | `https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=and&product_version=4.12.1&system_version=Android+16&browser=chrome&filters=21.19.18.3.7.2.4.11.20.22.208&dns_servers=quic%3A%2F%2Ffamily.adguard-dns.com&userscripts=https%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fadguard-extra%252F1.0%252Fadguard-extra.meta.js&android.mode=VPN&android.system_root=false&dns.filters=https%253A%252F%252Ffilters.adtidy.org%252Fandroid%252Ffilters%252F15_optimized.txt&dns.filters_enabled=true&dns.enabled=true&https.filtering=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.webrtc=false&stealth.push=false&stealth.location=false&stealth.strip_url=false&stealth.hide_search_queries=false&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.x_client=true&stealth.dpi=false&stealth.third_party_cookies=180&stealth.first_party_cookies=4320&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=false&stealth.block_third_party_auth=false&stealth.block_trackers=true&license_type=paid&dns.timeout=5000)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/217809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/217809/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3539615551","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/217809#issuecomment-3539615551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/217809","id":3539615551,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87S-j8_","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-11-17T01:29:17Z","updated_at":"2025-11-17T01:29:17Z","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has been open for 3 days with no activity.\nUnfortunately, our resources are limited and we can not always take the time to respond to requests about websites that are not popular enough.
