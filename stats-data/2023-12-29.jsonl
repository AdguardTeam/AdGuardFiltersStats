Comment\r\n> There is a display issue with outlook.live.com when using the \"AdGuard Base Filter\" (see screenshots) with AdGuard for Windows or the  \"AdGuard - Ads\" filter in uBlock Origin (tested in Edge, Chrome, Brave and Firefox). When the filter is enabled and the Calendar/To Do pane is turned on, the pane overlays the open mail pane. When the filter is disabled, this does not happen. Nothing relevant appears to be blocked in the logs and disabling AdGuard from the browser assistant for outlook.live.com does not resolve the problem. Only disabling the filter resolves the issue.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/1z4qmcd7xtk0kco04goggkggg0w04wc49wz3sztxnu.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tspl43k18y88008wckck400444w44gwcausgxikn14.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.16.0 (4542)\r\nBrowser: | brave 120.0.0.0\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://12j62f0q11j.dns.controld.com`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://login.live.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.live.com%2F)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1871638343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-29T00:13:44Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
