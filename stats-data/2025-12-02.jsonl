uses Real Cookie Banner Pro for consent management. I understand that blocking the actual cookie banner aligns with the Annoyance Filter’s purpose.\r\n> \r\n> What I am unsure about is whether the filter is supposed to block the plugin’s inline “content blocker” elements. On the affected page, we have two YouTube embeds. Before consent is given, the plugin replaces those embeds with its own placeholder. The user must interact with that placeholder before any third-party content is loaded.\r\n> \r\n> This mechanism exists to prevent YouTube from setting cookies until the user opts in. When the Annoyance Filter blocks these placeholders, it removes the user’s ability to give consent at all, and the embedded content can never be displayed.\r\n> \r\n> I have attached a screenshot illustrating the issue.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @gabbsmo\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/565kgmznhpgkwkwc8gcc8w840c4og4w3dylu308eka.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.2.400.0 MV2\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 11`\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880)\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter\r\nFilters last update: | December 02, 2025 at 10:04\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `1Password, Dark Reader`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=ext&product_version=5.2.400.0&system_version=Windows+11&manifest_version=2&browser=edge&filters=2.3.4.10.17.18.19.20.21.22.243&browsing_security.enabled=false&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.strip_url=true&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.third_party_cookies=2880&stealth.block_trackers=true&filters_last_update=2025-12-02T10%3A04%3A37)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/219254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/219254/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3601353003","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/219254#issuecomment-3601353003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/219254","id":3601353003,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87WqEkr","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-12-02T10:35:47Z","updated_at":"2025-12-02T10:35:47Z","body":"Fixed, the filters will update automatically.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3601353003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-12-02T10:35:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
