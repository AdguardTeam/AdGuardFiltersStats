Ever since yesterday, 1/26/25, I am unable to use the fanatics Sportsbook app on IOS. I have had the app since November 2024 and have used it with no issues. Ever since yesterday, I am getting a location error. I have cleared my filter list and reopened the app then tried unblocking the domains that were being blocked with no success. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/iloq3m2l9xs80ocscckcow8kg8kgss8n3hg93hw9dc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/e4in76p5sdckswos4osc4g8ks808cog7pa2zpha4f4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.8\r\nSystem version: | iOS 18.2.1\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://dns.adguard-dns.com`<br>filters: `https://small.oisd.nl`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nOther extensions used: | AdGuard Pro app using AdGuard implementation and AdGuard DNS-Over-QUIC.

Я попробовал убрать `webkitvisibilitychange`, и вроде это работает, но как будто не каждый раз:\r\n> \r\n> ```adblock\r\n> howdyho.net#%#//scriptlet('prevent-addEventListener', 'webkitvisibilitychange', '_nativeSwitch')\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\nUsername: `@rakleed`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/nj67bsevrg0o00sgg80c4kk8s48cgckligsrlmx0rk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.16.3.1867 release\r\nSystem version: | MacOS 15.3 (Build 24D60)\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://xxxxxxx@d.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | IMDb Tomatoes (url: https://update.greasyfork.org/scripts/15222/IMDb Tomatoes.user.js)<br>Nova YouTube beta (url: https://gist.github.com/raingart/d734dd35f7090e9824df15f52c36f8a0/raw/5b21b7d2d530ba4ee3b30dbd785d2aff455f2000/nova-dev.user.js)<br>AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nReferrer: | [https://howdyho.net/download/1513](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhowdyho.net%2Fdownload%2F1513)\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.info/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&channel=release&custom_filters=&dns.bootstraps=&dns.custom_filters=&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_enabled=false&dns.fallbacks=&dns.filters=&dns.servers=https%3A%2F%2Fd.adguard-dns.com%2Fdns-query%2Fxxxxxxx&dns.timeout=2000&extensions=IMDb+Tomatoes+%28script%3B+url%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fupdate.greasyfork.org%2Fscripts%2F15222%2FIMDb%2520Tomatoes.user.js%29%2CNova+YouTube+beta+%28script%3B+url%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2Fraingart%2Fd734dd35f7090e9824df15f52c36f8a0%2Fraw%2F5b21b7d2d530ba4ee3b30dbd785d2aff455f2000%2Fnova-dev.user.js%29%2CAdGuard+Extra+%28script%3B+url%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=1.2.3.4.11.17.18.19.20.21.22&product_type=Mac&product_version=2.16.3.1867+release&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fhowdyho.net%2Fdownload%2F1513&scheme_version=3&stealth.DNT=false&stealth.block_third_party_auth=false&stealth.block_trackers=true&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=true&stealth.dpi=true&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.java=false&stealth.location=false&stealth.push=false&stealth.referrer=&stealth.strip_url=true&stealth.third_party_cookies=180&stealth.user_agent=&stealth.webrtc=false&stealth.x_client=true&system_version=MacOS+15.3+%28Build+24D60%29&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Macintosh%3B+Intel+Mac+OS+X+10_15_7%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F132.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2625100823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-01-30T17:17:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

но после успешного прохождения, на сайте большая часть контента не загружается.\r\n> \r\n> При этом, если просто отключить `Hide User-Agent` или добавить сайт в исключения и перезагрузить страницу, то контент всё равно не будет загружаться. Нужно либо полностью перезапустить браузер, либо отключить и включить AdGuard дополнительно, перезагрузить страницу, и тогда сайт заработает корректно.\r\n> \r\n> То есть скорее всего проблема с капчей, точно такая же проблема на:\r\n> - https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196418\r\n> - https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197286\r\n> -
