[#161778 (comment)](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/161778#issuecomment-1726252290) I'm not sure that some of these parameters should be removed. @AdamWr what do you think?\r\n\r\nAccording to - https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/components/search_engines/template_url.h#210, `gs_lcrp` parameter has similar purpose like `aqs` (https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/+/07ca5b139b967f62b03f08fca5d6f37a373ed20f/chrome/browser/search_engines/template_url.h#60) which we already remove, so I have added a rule for this.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1727301880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-20T09:10:33Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Once the pop up opens, this pop up problem does not recur even if you refresh the page. You can only reproduce this problem by reopening the page in an incognito window. If you close the incognito window completely (like closing chrome completely), open the incognito window again and open this site again, the pop up will appear on the first click on the site.\r\n\r\nReason for pop up opening, i think it's because of this script.\r\n\r\n**https://www.canlimacizlemax17.com/cdn/script-26082023v2.js**\r\n\r\nIf i'm block this script completely no pop up but video player and some other things are blocking too.
