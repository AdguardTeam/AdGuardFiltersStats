is not an official reply but I don't think AdGuard can filter such ads on Toffee, for reasons why it can't filter for example Facebook app. It's probably possible on a rooted phone but it doesn't seem your phone is rooted (correct me if I'm wrong). \r\n\r\nSecondly, you are using too many redundant filters. More filters don't mean more blocking. \r\nYou don't need to use Easylist because it's already part of AdGuard Base. \r\nUsually, it's not recommended to use both EasyPrivacy and AdGuard Tracking Protection at the same time. It can cause breakage. \r\nYou don't need Peter Lowe's Blocklist as it should be covered by AdGuard DNS filter and OISD BIG that you're using. \r\nAdGuard Annoyances includes AdGuard Cookie Notices,\r\nAdGuard Other Annoyances,\r\nAdGuard Widgets,\r\nAdGuard Popups,\r\nAdGuard Mobile App Banners. So either use AdGuard Annoyances alone or use them separately. \r\nYou don't need an Adblock Warning Removal List, AdGuard Base has anti-adblocking rules compatible with AdGuard products. If you find anti-adblocker on websites then simply report like you have here.\r\nFanboy's Annoyances already has EasyList Cookies. But, you should not need Fanboy's Annoyances and Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List as such annoyances are covered by AdGuard's filters in the Annoyance section. \r\nYou don't need to use the AdGuard DNS filter in the Other section as you are already using it in the DNS filtering section. Even your DNS is AdGuard DNS. \r\nIn my opinion, you also don't need to use the filters you're using in the Security section as they are covered by OISD Big which covers much more than that.\r\nI also see too many redundant filters in the custom filter section. You don't need uBO filters in AdGuard. AdGuard Base covers Indian Languages also. Get rid off them unless there's something you absolutely need for some purpose. \r\nYou also should not use anti-adblock killer and adbypasser UserScripts with AdGuard.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, a lot of overlapping filters that are absolutely unnecessary. Getting rid of these will also improve performance and battery life.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2157296943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-10T05:26:35Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
