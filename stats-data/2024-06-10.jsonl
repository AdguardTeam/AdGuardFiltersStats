is not an official reply but I don't think AdGuard can filter such ads on Toffee, for reasons why it can't filter for example Facebook app. It's probably possible on a rooted phone but it doesn't seem your phone is rooted (correct me if I'm wrong). \r\n\r\nSecondly, you are using too many redundant filters. More filters don't mean more blocking. \r\nYou don't need to use Easylist because it's already part of AdGuard Base. \r\nUsually, it's not recommended to use both EasyPrivacy and AdGuard Tracking Protection at the same time. It can cause breakage. \r\nYou don't need Peter Lowe's Blocklist as it should be covered by AdGuard DNS filter and OISD BIG that you're using. \r\nAdGuard Annoyances includes AdGuard Cookie Notices,\r\nAdGuard Other Annoyances,\r\nAdGuard Widgets,\r\nAdGuard Popups,\r\nAdGuard Mobile App Banners. So either use AdGuard Annoyances alone or use them separately. \r\nYou don't need an Adblock Warning Removal List, AdGuard Base has anti-adblocking rules compatible with AdGuard products. If you find anti-adblocker on websites then simply report like you have here.\r\nFanboy's Annoyances already has EasyList Cookies. But, you should not need Fanboy's Annoyances and Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List as such annoyances are covered by AdGuard's filters in the Annoyance section. \r\nYou don't need to use the AdGuard DNS filter in the Other section as you are already using it in the DNS filtering section. Even your DNS is AdGuard DNS. \r\nIn my opinion, you also don't need to use the filters you're using in the Security section as they are covered by OISD Big which covers much more than that.\r\nI also see too many redundant filters in the custom filter section. You don't need uBO filters in AdGuard. AdGuard Base covers Indian Languages also. Get rid off them unless there's something you absolutely need for some purpose. \r\nYou also should not use anti-adblock killer and adbypasser UserScripts with AdGuard.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, a lot of overlapping filters that are absolutely unnecessary. Getting rid of these will also improve performance and battery life.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2157296943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-10T05:26:35Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://trk.klclick.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftrk.klclick.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Whitelisting the domain redirect did absolutely nothing to stop AdGuard from blocking it. Maybe I just don’t know how to use this thing, but it doesn’t exactly come with instructions, and I followed all the ones it gave me for unblocking. I sign up for certain marketing lists, I sometimes click on links in their emails, and I think I should have the right to do that when the advertising is consensual, regardless of what AdGuard thinks of the websites my preferred vendors use to facilitate their marketing efforts. By the way, I have no idea which AdGuard features are actually active on my phone and apparently no way of figuring it out, so I just checked all the boxes related to AdGuard. To be clear, I’m using AdGuard Premium and haven’t done much to customize the experience, other than going deep into my iPhone settings to prevent the included VPN from turning itself back on every time I turn it off. It’s fairly effective at doing what it says on the tin, but it’s also very opaque and presumptuous. I suppose that’s a harbinger for whatever fresh hell AI is going to bring to devices, whether invited or otherwise. I’m not allergic to technology, but if something on my phone is going to have a mind of its own, it better start paying its share of the phone bill instead of living rent-free while eating all my data out of the fridge…\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/e3zqjaqg38oog4s0w4cw8c88c8cg4k05ub2dz7aahc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/p37zhyrg5kgo48wog8gwsgo4wg8w8so3yezvb668nw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/lr3aqqlsxfkwsw0wwckg84s8w00gckcj56013ikv8g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nSystem version: | iOS 17.5.1\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `127.0.0.1`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental, <br/>AdGuard DNS","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2159100902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-10T19:06:37Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
