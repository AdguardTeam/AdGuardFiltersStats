website\r\n> AdGuard URL Tracking filter\r\n> Legitimate URL Shortener             \r\n> The feedback that caused the website to fail to redirect was that I reinstalled the plugin and turned off all functions. Even after enabling only the above functions, I still couldn't redirect, so I had to turn off and redirect\r\n> I found during testing that if I open all the filtered content on this website, the plugin crashes and needs to be reinstalled. I have triggered it about 8 times, and I only open it\r\n> AdGuard URL Tracking filter\r\n> Legitimate URL Shortener    \r\n> These two items, as well as the forced activation of Chinese language filtering without any other filtering, will also work well. If the plugin crashes and needs to be reinstalled, the probability is very small\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jl6xj8kuw8ow4g8ggc80c4sook00sko773fxmam8mo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/dvxpm0y779s888c88oo00k8cocogo8sk7x916x0di8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.79 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | 11","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205970/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2919801921","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205970#issuecomment-2919801921","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205970","id":2919801921,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86uCKRB","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-29T15:42:43Z","updated_at":"2025-05-29T15:42:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://www.youku.com/ku/webhome](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youku.com%2Fku%2Fwebhome)\r\n### Comment\r\n> The problem I encountered is more serious than yours, it is 404, and when I try again, AdGuard crashes again, can you open this page to prove 2 points, the bad news is that you need to use a Chinese IP to watch the video, the good news is that this has nothing to do with the problem I reported and does not affect you to troubleshoot the problem. You have to turn on the filter I specified to verify the result, click on the video because the URL filter rule setting causes the deletion of important parameters and the connection access fails Redirect to https://www.youku.com/index/y404?type=urlInvalid&detail=, which is different from ad element filtering I hope that the URL rule filtering aspect can also adapt to the whitelist strategy, which is not currently enforced by the whitelist constraints, Or there are more flexible custom rule performance, because this is the second time I've reported this kind of problem, and many people may not find a reason for it to use the whitelist to temporarily transition and wait for subsequent feedback\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/s77t73x67lwk088cocko4s8kgc404ggb25l5mlfcfc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mt711wr5xhwo84cs4wgww8sccogg8sw6sh510cuo1k.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.79 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2919801921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-29T15:42:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Please note this is a very recent regression that started on May 27, 2025 and prior to that all video ads were blocked. \n\nThe behaviour is different on iPhone where mobile version of YouTube in Safari is used. In that case all ads are blocked as before.\n\nIn desktop Safari, with latest AdGuard and all most up to date filters, the behaviour is different for logged in case vs viewing without logging in.\n\nIf I don't log in to my account, no video ads are displayed. When clicking on any video, it plays immediately with no spinner and no ads. \n\nIf I do log in, the behaviour changes:\n\nOnce you click on any video, the page loads and video does not play immediately. Initially, spinner is displayed for quite long time and after that an ad is displayed. You have an option to skip the ad and then the video plays normally. \n\nPlease note that Brave Browser with its default ad blocker does not display any ads and videos start immediately. Firefox with uBlock Origin also works as normal.\n\niPad Safari (latest iPadOS, Adguard Pro and filters up to date) also shows the same experience and desktop Safari.\n\nInterestingly engough Brave Browser on iPad does block all ads as before and video startup experience is different.

I tested it and the only thing I have enabled is base and I get the same issue although it takes much less time to show. When enabled the page lags and locks up although less badly but when I select \"reload without content blockers\", the page works as it should. You can refer to the screen recording below. \n\n\nAlso I have to use \"reload without content blockers\" as for some reason, using the extension and disabling \"enabled on this website\" doesn't seem to work and the issue is still present so I don't know if this is a filter problem or an issue with the extension itself. \n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98899c42-b8a4-4cc3-b8d6-2fc088131101","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2920441767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-29T20:00:23Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
