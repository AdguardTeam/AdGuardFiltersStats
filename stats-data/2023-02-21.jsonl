GoMovies it recently started launching Ads sometimes when you tap on a tab/function. I opened it and when I hit \"home\" it opened a new tab, appeared to open a couple of different things before settling on Monster.ca. Sometimes when it happens it take a coupe or clicks with the trackpad before it does something. In all the years I've used AdGuard I've never had an issue it works so well. I've not changed any of the setting. It started doing this a few weeks ago. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/cuvAtBd.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Zedd0HA.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.10\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List\r\nCustom filters: | Easy List\r\nOther extensions used: | AdGuard is amazing. It used to work on the site I stream from https://gomovies.sx until recently. Now it randomly \"freezes\" when you go to click on a button. It takes another click or two for something to happen and then it opens a new tab with random promotions which themselves most often get stopped. This is only happening with GoMovies site. In all the years I've used it this is actually the first issue I've encountered, so thank you!

description\n\nIf users have the AdGuard enabled in their adblocking extensions, then they cannot load our feature flags and a/b tests. The effect is different across our product, such as missing new functionality, new styles, or new versions of existing capabilities. This is especially problematic when we expect all users of a customer to have access to a capability they have paid for.\r\n\r\nHere are the websites we are having trouble with\r\n\r\n`https://*.guildeducation.com`\r\n`https://optimizely.guildeducation.com/*`\r\n`https://*.guildeducation.com/optimizelydatafile=*`\r\n`https://cdn.optimizely.com/datafiles/* with referrer from https://*.guildeducation.com`\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdding `guildeducation.com` to the AllowedList of domains for Optimizely .\n\n### Additional information\n\nOur company’s product, offered through [guildeducation.com](http://guildeducation.com/) does not serve any types of ads or ad-related materials. We are an education benefit provider, helping connect our users to debt-free education. We do use Optimizely for product management best practices of testing new offerings for our users.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142370/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142370/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-21T07:55:52Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
