Some of them have ads, which is why I use the ad blocker. However, let's say I am watching a movie, and it is finished, and I go to click pause, and it takes me to another tab with either weird ads or sexually inappropriate images. It is not just that one ad site, many other sites pop up randomly.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/X4Upcfn.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.11\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146699/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146699/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-27T20:26:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
