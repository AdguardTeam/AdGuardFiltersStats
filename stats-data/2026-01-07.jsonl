Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmytotalconnectcomfort.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> This is the site I use to control my thermostat in my home so I need it to be working.  I've been through extensive troubleshooting to fix this over the past few weeks and I had to take my computer to a specialist for $80 to determine that the issue is caused by AdGuard.  I didn't think it was initially because I disabled AdGuard on this site and it still wouldn't load.  However, he pointed out that if I completely exit AdGuard, then the site will load properly.   My screenshots are of AdGuard still running on my computer, but with it disabled on the site, and the site will not load with \"ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED\".  The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmytotalconnectcomfort.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> This is the site I use to control my thermostat in my home so I need it to be working.  I've been through extensive troubleshooting to fix this over the past few weeks and I had to take my computer to a specialist for $80 to determine that the issue is caused by AdGuard.  I didn't think it was initially because I disabled AdGuard on this site and it still wouldn't load.  However, he pointed out that if I completely exit AdGuard, then the site will load properly.   My screenshots are of AdGuard still running on my computer, but with it disabled on the site, and the site will not load with \"ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED\".  The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://m.naver.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.naver.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Hello, this is the Naver Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS (dns.adguard.com) cannot access naver.com domains. We received confirmation from AdGuard support that naver.com domains are not blocked.\r\n> \r\n> As a follow-up, we would like to provide additional details about the ongoing issue.\r\n> \r\n> **Issue Overview:**\r\n> We have recently received numerous reports from customers experiencing difficulties accessing Naver-related services through Android apps (Chrome, Google app, Naver app, etc.) when using AdGuard DNS. Based on customer inquiries and internal reproduction tests, we have confirmed that this issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS in conjunction with LG U+, a major network provider in South Korea.\r\n> \r\n> **Symptoms:**\r\n> * Various Naver services (Naver Search, Naver Shopping, Naver News, etc.) are inaccessible or fail to load properly\r\n>   > For example, when accessing \"m.naver.com\" through mobile Chrome or Google app, users encounter errors such as \"Unable to connect to the Internet\" or \"This site can't be reached\"\r\n>   > Web pages fail to load in browser apps, displaying ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED errors\r\n> * The issue is primarily reported by Android users\r\n> * The problem occurs intermittently (not continuously), sometimes lasting several minutes\r\n> * Our internal testing confirms the issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS with the LG U+ network\r\n>   > Configuration: Phone Settings > Connections > More connection settings > Private DNS > dns.adguard-dns.com (or dns.adguard.com)\r\n> \r\n> **Actions Taken:**\r\n> The Naver development team has contacted the LG U+ network team to investigate this issue further. We are reaching out to request AdGuard's cooperation as well, as this appears to be an interaction between AdGuard DNS and the LG U+ network that is affecting our users' ability to access Naver services.\r\n> \r\n> We appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/l12z5xty3tsk004k8000skoks8w80wsb2r994pz5r4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/16ho0xijiiw0g4w8gookogko4g4ss0kphwb4855j00.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/sy801lsz4000s8c0s0wgkwcc4s0wcg4dje2wixxao0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/eqnqnc2iq8g8g04cw8o0ksogcg8gg48lnokjgnjwzk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/iadqmo6ipq0wocgkcwggs8o0k8ggk40tpgtxpyimsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/oljxujs1sn4w8swck4okwgow4ssswk0e96d8hnp0f4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/tkvknvqico0gw4880gs0kcokg444woseo1nz2b8zfc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/6s32hb49exgc48k8kcowg04ogowgcowbz4xhkisev4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Android 16`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3717225685","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474#issuecomment-3717225685","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474","id":3717225685,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87dkFzV","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-07T03:57:10Z","updated_at":"2026-01-07T03:57:10Z","body":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474#issuecomment-3713551660\nCurrently, AdGuard DNS does not block the domains by anti-phishing or filters list.\nIt seems that filters list maintainer needs to forward to AdGuard's DNS department.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3717225685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2026-01-07T03:57:10Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmytotalconnectcomfort.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> This is the site I use to control my thermostat in my home so I need it to be working.  I've been through extensive troubleshooting to fix this over the past few weeks and I had to take my computer to a specialist for $80 to determine that the issue is caused by AdGuard.  I didn't think it was initially because I disabled AdGuard on this site and it still wouldn't load.  However, he pointed out that if I completely exit AdGuard, then the site will load properly.   My screenshots are of AdGuard still running on my computer, but with it disabled on the site, and the site will not load with \"ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED\".  The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://m.naver.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.naver.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Hello, this is the Naver Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS (dns.adguard.com) cannot access naver.com domains. We received confirmation from AdGuard support that naver.com domains are not blocked.\r\n> \r\n> As a follow-up, we would like to provide additional details about the ongoing issue.\r\n> \r\n> **Issue Overview:**\r\n> We have recently received numerous reports from customers experiencing difficulties accessing Naver-related services through Android apps (Chrome, Google app, Naver app, etc.) when using AdGuard DNS. Based on customer inquiries and internal reproduction tests, we have confirmed that this issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS in conjunction with LG U+, a major network provider in South Korea.\r\n> \r\n> **Symptoms:**\r\n> * Various Naver services (Naver Search, Naver Shopping, Naver News, etc.) are inaccessible or fail to load properly\r\n>   > For example, when accessing \"m.naver.com\" through mobile Chrome or Google app, users encounter errors such as \"Unable to connect to the Internet\" or \"This site can't be reached\"\r\n>   > Web pages fail to load in browser apps, displaying ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED errors\r\n> * The issue is primarily reported by Android users\r\n> * The problem occurs intermittently (not continuously), sometimes lasting several minutes\r\n> * Our internal testing confirms the issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS with the LG U+ network\r\n>   > Configuration: Phone Settings > Connections > More connection settings > Private DNS > dns.adguard-dns.com (or dns.adguard.com)\r\n> \r\n> **Actions Taken:**\r\n> The Naver development team has contacted the LG U+ network team to investigate this issue further. We are reaching out to request AdGuard's cooperation as well, as this appears to be an interaction between AdGuard DNS and the LG U+ network that is affecting our users' ability to access Naver services.\r\n> \r\n> We appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/l12z5xty3tsk004k8000skoks8w80wsb2r994pz5r4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/16ho0xijiiw0g4w8gookogko4g4ss0kphwb4855j00.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/sy801lsz4000s8c0s0wgkwcc4s0wcg4dje2wixxao0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/eqnqnc2iq8g8g04cw8o0ksogcg8gg48lnokjgnjwzk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/iadqmo6ipq0wocgkcwggs8o0k8ggk40tpgtxpyimsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/oljxujs1sn4w8swck4okwgow4ssswk0e96d8hnp0f4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/tkvknvqico0gw4880gs0kcokg444woseo1nz2b8zfc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/6s32hb49exgc48k8kcowg04ogowgcowbz4xhkisev4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Android 16`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3717374486","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474#issuecomment-3717374486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474","id":3717374486,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87dkqIW","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-07T05:29:26Z","updated_at":"2026-01-07T05:29:26Z","body":"Sent a request about the further instruction to AdGuard CTO (Currently, in vacation).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3717374486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2026-01-07T05:29:26Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://m.naver.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.naver.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Hello, this is the Naver Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS (dns.adguard.com) cannot access naver.com domains. We received confirmation from AdGuard support that naver.com domains are not blocked.\r\n> \r\n> As a follow-up, we would like to provide additional details about the ongoing issue.\r\n> \r\n> **Issue Overview:**\r\n> We have recently received numerous reports from customers experiencing difficulties accessing Naver-related services through Android apps (Chrome, Google app, Naver app, etc.) when using AdGuard DNS. Based on customer inquiries and internal reproduction tests, we have confirmed that this issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS in conjunction with LG U+, a major network provider in South Korea.\r\n> \r\n> **Symptoms:**\r\n> * Various Naver services (Naver Search, Naver Shopping, Naver News, etc.) are inaccessible or fail to load properly\r\n>   > For example, when accessing \"m.naver.com\" through mobile Chrome or Google app, users encounter errors such as \"Unable to connect to the Internet\" or \"This site can't be reached\"\r\n>   > Web pages fail to load in browser apps, displaying ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED errors\r\n> * The issue is primarily reported by Android users\r\n> * The problem occurs intermittently (not continuously), sometimes lasting several minutes\r\n> * Our internal testing confirms the issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS with the LG U+ network\r\n>   > Configuration: Phone Settings > Connections > More connection settings > Private DNS > dns.adguard-dns.com (or dns.adguard.com)\r\n> \r\n> **Actions Taken:**\r\n> The Naver development team has contacted the LG U+ network team to investigate this issue further. We are reaching out to request AdGuard's cooperation as well, as this appears to be an interaction between AdGuard DNS and the LG U+ network that is affecting our users' ability to access Naver services.\r\n> \r\n> We appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/l12z5xty3tsk004k8000skoks8w80wsb2r994pz5r4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/16ho0xijiiw0g4w8gookogko4g4ss0kphwb4855j00.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/sy801lsz4000s8c0s0wgkwcc4s0wcg4dje2wixxao0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/eqnqnc2iq8g8g04cw8o0ksogcg8gg48lnokjgnjwzk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/iadqmo6ipq0wocgkcwggs8o0k8ggk40tpgtxpyimsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/oljxujs1sn4w8swck4okwgow4ssswk0e96d8hnp0f4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/tkvknvqico0gw4880gs0kcokg444woseo1nz2b8zfc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/6s32hb49exgc48k8kcowg04ogowgcowbz4xhkisev4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Android 16`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3717348644","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474#issuecomment-3717348644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474","id":3717348644,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87dkj0k","user":{"login":"JunyeongSeok","id":11582227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTgyMjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11582227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok","html_url":"https://github.com/JunyeongSeok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-07T05:14:08Z","updated_at":"2026-01-07T05:14:08Z","body":"Thanks for confirming that Naver domains aren't blocked by your filters.\n\nSince you mentioned this needs to be forwarded to AdGuard's DNS department, quick question:\n\n**Should I continue this discussion here in this GitHub repo, or is there a different channel for DNS infrastructure issues?**\n\nIf there's a more appropriate place for this (support ticket, different repo, direct contact with DNS team, etc.), please let me know and I'll follow up there.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3717348644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2026-01-07T05:14:08Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS (dns.adguard.com) cannot access naver.com domains. We received confirmation from AdGuard support that naver.com domains are not blocked.\r\n> \r\n> As a follow-up, we would like to provide additional details about the ongoing issue.\r\n> \r\n> **Issue Overview:**\r\n> We have recently received numerous reports from customers experiencing difficulties accessing Naver-related services through Android apps (Chrome, Google app, Naver app, etc.) when using AdGuard DNS. Based on customer inquiries and internal reproduction tests, we have confirmed that this issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS in conjunction with LG U+, a major network provider in South Korea.\r\n> \r\n> **Symptoms:**\r\n> * Various Naver services (Naver Search, Naver Shopping, Naver News, etc.) are inaccessible or fail to load properly\r\n>   > For example, when accessing \"m.naver.com\" through mobile Chrome or Google app, users encounter errors such as \"Unable to connect to the Internet\" or \"This site can't be reached\"\r\n>   > Web pages fail to load in browser apps, displaying ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED errors\r\n> * The issue is primarily reported by Android users\r\n> * The problem occurs intermittently (not continuously), sometimes lasting several minutes\r\n> * Our internal testing confirms the issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS with the LG U+ network\r\n>   > Configuration: Phone Settings > Connections > More connection settings > Private DNS > dns.adguard-dns.com (or dns.adguard.com)\r\n> \r\n> **Actions Taken:**\r\n> The Naver development team has contacted the LG U+ network team to investigate this issue further. We are reaching out to request AdGuard's cooperation as well, as this appears to be an interaction between AdGuard DNS and the LG U+ network that is affecting our users' ability to access Naver services.\r\n> \r\n> We appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/l12z5xty3tsk004k8000skoks8w80wsb2r994pz5r4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/16ho0xijiiw0g4w8gookogko4g4ss0kphwb4855j00.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/sy801lsz4000s8c0s0wgkwcc4s0wcg4dje2wixxao0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/eqnqnc2iq8g8g04cw8o0ksogcg8gg48lnokjgnjwzk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/iadqmo6ipq0wocgkcwggs8o0k8ggk40tpgtxpyimsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/oljxujs1sn4w8swck4okwgow4ssswk0e96d8hnp0f4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/tkvknvqico0gw4880gs0kcokg444woseo1nz2b8zfc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/6s32hb49exgc48k8kcowg04ogowgcowbz4xhkisev4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Android 16`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3717786268","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474#issuecomment-3717786268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474","id":3717786268,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87dmOqc","user":{"login":"JunyeongSeok","id":11582227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTgyMjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11582227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok","html_url":"https://github.com/JunyeongSeok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-07T08:20:05Z","updated_at":"2026-01-07T08:20:05Z","body":"We're not sure about the timing - we've been getting reports throughout the day without a clear pattern.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3717786268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2026-01-07T08:20:05Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

recommend to use only app (or just extension).\n\nOne more thing is that we don't know your AdGuard app configuration.\nIf the rule above does not work, please send report through AdGuard

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://m.naver.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.naver.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Hello, this is the Naver Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS (dns.adguard.com) cannot access naver.com domains. We received confirmation from AdGuard support that naver.com domains are not blocked.\r\n> \r\n> As a follow-up, we would like to provide additional details about the ongoing issue.\r\n> \r\n> **Issue Overview:**\r\n> We have recently received numerous reports from customers experiencing difficulties accessing Naver-related services through Android apps (Chrome, Google app, Naver app, etc.) when using AdGuard DNS. Based on customer inquiries and internal reproduction tests, we have confirmed that this issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS in conjunction with LG U+, a major network provider in South Korea.\r\n> \r\n> **Symptoms:**\r\n> * Various Naver services (Naver Search, Naver Shopping, Naver News, etc.) are inaccessible or fail to load properly\r\n>   > For example, when accessing \"m.naver.com\" through mobile Chrome or Google app, users encounter errors such as \"Unable to connect to the Internet\" or \"This site can't be reached\"\r\n>   > Web pages fail to load in browser apps, displaying ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED errors\r\n> * The issue is primarily reported by Android users\r\n> * The problem occurs intermittently (not continuously), sometimes lasting several minutes\r\n> * Our internal testing confirms the issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS with the LG U+ network\r\n>   > Configuration: Phone Settings > Connections > More connection settings > Private DNS > dns.adguard-dns.com (or dns.adguard.com)\r\n> \r\n> **Actions Taken:**\r\n> The Naver development team has contacted the LG U+ network team to investigate this issue further. We are reaching out to request AdGuard's cooperation as well, as this appears to be an interaction between AdGuard DNS and the LG U+ network that is affecting our users' ability to access Naver services.\r\n> \r\n> We appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/l12z5xty3tsk004k8000skoks8w80wsb2r994pz5r4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/16ho0xijiiw0g4w8gookogko4g4ss0kphwb4855j00.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/sy801lsz4000s8c0s0wgkwcc4s0wcg4dje2wixxao0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/eqnqnc2iq8g8g04cw8o0ksogcg8gg48lnokjgnjwzk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/iadqmo6ipq0wocgkcwggs8o0k8ggk40tpgtxpyimsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/oljxujs1sn4w8swck4okwgow4ssswk0e96d8hnp0f4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/tkvknvqico0gw4880gs0kcokg444woseo1nz2b8zfc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/6s32hb49exgc48k8kcowg04ogowgcowbz4xhkisev4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Android 16`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3717987865","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474#issuecomment-3717987865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474","id":3717987865,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87dm_4Z","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-07T09:23:29Z","updated_at":"2026-01-07T09:23:29Z","body":"If someone experiences a similar issue in the future, can you ask them to get what the value is at `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/info.txt` in a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) with what AdGuard DNS (DNS over TLS) in Android system setting is disabled?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3717987865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2026-01-07T09:23:29Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmytotalconnectcomfort.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> This is the site I use to control my thermostat in my home so I need it to be working.  I've been through extensive troubleshooting to fix this over the past few weeks and I had to take my computer to a specialist for $80 to determine that the issue is caused by AdGuard.  I didn't think it was initially because I disabled AdGuard on this site and it still wouldn't load.  However, he pointed out that if I completely exit AdGuard, then the site will load properly.   My screenshots are of AdGuard still running on my computer, but with it disabled on the site, and the site will not load with \"ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED\".  The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

Comment\r\n> If I go to this site with AdGuard enable I have to go through the \"Press and Hold\" to prove you're a human process every time.  With AdGuard disabled I don't have to do this.  This only started recently, in the past 2 weeks.  I want to be able to have AdGuard enabled to block ads on the site.  This has also been happening lately with www.walmart.com.  Thanks.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
