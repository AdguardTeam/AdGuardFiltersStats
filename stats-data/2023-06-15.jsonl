HOWEVER, for some reason it’s not doing that anymore!!\r\n> On the website I linked (9anime.to) if I try to click ANYTHING it will redirect me to any number of countless scam websites. It opens up a new browsing window, and takes me to a completely different page/site.\r\n> This hasn’t ever been a problem for me before, because AdGuard wouldn’t allow them to take me anywhere — but all of a sudden AdGuard stopped blocking them!  HELP!!\r\n> \r\n> I’ve spent the last day and a half trying to figure out what can be done. I’ve updated, made sure all filters are active and on, and tried updating the app several different times too. NOTHING works. When I click the spinning arrows in the top right of the screen, eventually (after I wait forever while it says it’s updating) it gives me the error “Filter update error” and stops. I’ve tried four separate times, just sitting here staring at those circling arrows until the error message pops up.
