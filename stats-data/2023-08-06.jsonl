I have the same problem with all galleries (bulletin boards) on a site called dcinside. The gallery I specified in the link is just one example.\r\n> \r\n> 2. intermittently, when I try to access, refresh, enter a post/comment, etc., it just loads pointlessly and never completes, as if the browser is lagging.\r\n> \r\n> 3. In that state, I can't select any links, try to refresh again, or even hit back button to go back until I get to the new tab home.\r\n> \r\n> 4. like 'namu wiki', I have a suspicion that the company is intentionally making the site difficult to use if you have adblock enabled.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/npk3eowo1hws8880kw84k4oosw40wo0btj3rewqkjc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/iw5zdzox51k4kgkwco0wwo0g4040k8o5umb8xhphjc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.14\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (30), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://***.d.adguard-dns.com,tls://254ff525.d.adguard-dns.com,https://254ff525.d.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/windows/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>List-KR, <br/>AdGuard Japanese\r\nUserscripts: | https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/List-KR/NamuLink@main/NamuLink.user.js,<br>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/List-KR/microShield@main/microShield.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/lists?id=ftl](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgall.dcinside.com%2Fmgallery%2Fboard%2Flists%3Fid%3Dftl)\r\nOther extensions used: |  Listly/DownThemAll!/Eightify/Gimme Summary/GoFullPage/Image Downloader/ShareGPT/클린디씨/프롬프트 지니/Ahnlab V3","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158328/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-06T01:05:10Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
