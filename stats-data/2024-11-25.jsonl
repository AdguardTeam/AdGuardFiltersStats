The relevant filter ebay.*##.gadget-banner.bottom-of-page is not working on iPhone\r\n\r\nThere is no such rule on iOS due to the limitations of the Safari Content Blocking API.\r\nHowever, there is a similar one in the AdGuard Mobile App Banners as I [mentioned earlier](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/193578#issuecomment-2497752804). I see that the rule works fine on your end. Please try to update the filters by waiting in AdGuard for 2-3 min.\r\nIf that does not help, try to re-enable web extensions (content blockers) in the Safari settings (wait about the same amount of time as you did when you updated the filters).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2497818674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-25T11:58:01Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
