Creating the pull request\r\n\r\n> Please include a summary of the change and which issue is fixed\\\r\n> If the related issue does not exist in our repository, please create it before making pull request\\\r\n> It is highly recommended to use our [Web Reporting Tool](https://kb.adguard.com/technical-support/reporting-tool) instead of creating an issue on GitHub directly\\\r\n> Please note, that we verify every pull request manually, so it may take time to apply it\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### To avoid invalid pull requests, please check and confirm following terms\r\n\r\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report;\r\n- [x] My code follows the [guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [ ] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [ ] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [x] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\n\r\n### Enter the issue address\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198137\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\n#### If possible, a screenshot of a page or application should not be cropped too much. Otherwise, it is not always clear where the element is located\r\n\r\n0. **DO NOT** upload screenshots with sexually explicit material on GitHub directly.\\\r\n Instead, upload it to a third-party image hosting and post the link to it without preview (!) here.\\\r\n Also, mention if the link leads to NSFW content;\r\n\r\n1. Add screenshots of the problem. You can drag and drop images or paste them from clipboard\r\n\r\n    Use `<details> </details>` tag to hide screenshots under the spoiler;\r\n\r\n2. Describe the issue in detail until it is absolutely clear from the screenshot what the problem is\r\n\r\n    You can also indicate any other information that you think the developers should know.\r\n\r\n**Warning:** Please remove personal information before uploading screenshots!\r\n\r\n1. Your comment\r\n\r\nLooks like the overlay appears in multiple sites (I see many in specific list as well). Should we make it generic and remove duplicated in specific list or should we still make the rule per-site?\r\n\r\n2.

Used by hundreds of webshops. In this system, they used Cookie notice. With AdGuard Mobile, this notice hidden, but full with overlay broke sites. Can scroll up and down, but can not click anywhere or navigate on site, so site is broken. With turned of AdGuard Cookie Notices filter (or if use only AdGuard Annoyances filter turned of this) works properly. I tested with Fanboy's Annoyances and Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances filters and also works well. Please add exception or fix full width overlay that broke sites. Thank You :)\n\n2.

guess that the problem is that script from `connatix.com` is loaded in `about:blank` iframe and source of this script is not detected by apps.\nIt looks like that as a workaround we could add `srcdoc` attribute to this `iframe` by using `$replace` rule like (seems to works fine on my end and referrer is added to request, though I'm not sure exactly why):\n```adblock\n||sport24.gr^$replace=/((.)\\.src='javascript:false';)/\\$1\\$2.srcdoc='';/,document\n```\nAfter adding this rule clearing cache or refreshing website by using
