Comment\r\n> When using the admin panel of Taboola, a specific URL fails to load if AdGuard's language filters are enabled, even when AdGuard is disabled for the website. This issue breaks the website and prevents the report from being generated.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> AdGuard Status:\r\n> AdGuard is disabled for the website.\r\n> Language-specific filters in AdGuard are enabled.\r\n> Problem:\r\n> With language-specific filters enabled, the URL request gets blocked before it executes, causing the website to break and the report generation to fail.\r\n> When language filters are turned off, the URL loads successfully, and the network request executes correctly.\r\n> \r\n> Steps to Reproduce:\r\n> You can't reproduce it, but I'm explaining.\r\n> Disable AdGuard for the Taboola admin panel website.\r\n> Ensure language filters in AdGuard are enabled.\r\n> In the network panel URL request gets blocked, breaking the website and preventing report generation.\r\n> Disable the language filters in AdGuard.\r\n> Attempt to load the URL again and observe that it loads successfully.\r\n> \r\n> Expected Behavior:\r\n> The URL should load successfully, and the report should generate correctly even if the language filters are enabled, given that AdGuard is disabled for the website.\r\n> \r\n> URL: https://backstage.taboola.com/backstage/resources/components/requirejs/require.js\r\nUsername: `@Chetan7575`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/91zogxt5ehgck44kko88gwcog0s48k84qd3npnc2wa.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/5d6xnzxv6tc0kcsw8oc80o84ww4c0s43glz7z2op28.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.53\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880)\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182230/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-28T09:11:56Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

When AdGuard is running while I'm watching shows on Hulu, the ads do come through but I can fast forward through them.  The problem arises, I think, with Hulu behaving like I'm watching an ad-free version of the show that's 7-10 minutes shorter than the version \"with ads.\" The closed captioning is way out of sync, and the popup for \"next episode/watch credits\" happens 7-10 minutes prior to when the credits really run.  After that popup, during the last 7-10 minutes of the show, if I hit forward/backward it will \"reset\" to that point in the video where the system thinks the show is over but it's really got 7-10 minutes left.  If I disable AdGuard this problem resolves but then I can't skip the ads anymore.  I do have a Hulu \"with ads\" membership, so maybe I just need to suck it up, but I figured it was worth checking.  If AdGuard can get around this problem a lot more people would be willing to pay for AdGuard. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/g8x032hh1y8kk4og4888s484s8cswc0hbnu9v3hii0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/fmeyxx5e334kcokk0co4wo4cs8www082s7bl4zoplk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.12.2.1415 release\r\nSystem version: | Mac OS 14.4.1 (23E224)\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/mac_v2/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nOther extensions used: | Apple Safari, I think, has some relevant features ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182404/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2197408342","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182404#issuecomment-2197408342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182404","id":2197408342,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86C-cpW","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-28T18:03:07Z","updated_at":"2024-06-28T18:03:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi.\r\nThe length of video is correct, but ad length is included in subtitles and probably other metadata.
