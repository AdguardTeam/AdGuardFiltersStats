They can be found by:\r\n`document.cookie =`\r\nThey must be replaced by `set-cookie` / `set-cookie-reload` / `trusted-set-cookie-reload` scriptlet rules.\r\n\r\nThere are many old rules, so first you need to check if the site is available, and then the need for the rule.\r\n\r\n* For convenience, you can work in a separate browser\r\n* Retrieve the list of domains, clean up duplicates and check if sites exist (if redirects occur, we assume that the site is dead).\r\n* All such rules can be merged into one file, convert them to exception rules and import as custom filter. Then go down the list and check if the rules are needed (other types of problems not related to these rules are skipped).\r\n* If the site is dead - add domains in the comment below. Then we will remove them from the filters.\r\n\r\nIn order not to overlap with other filter maintainers, it is desirable to perform batch rule replacement via pull-requests (5-10 rules per PR).\r\n\r\n### Important\r\nIt should be checked with a Dutch or German VPN, because otherwise the cookie usage messages may not appear.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1842809428","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756#issuecomment-1842809428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756","id":1842809428,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85t1wpU","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-06T12:50:55Z","updated_at":"2023-12-06T12:50:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Dead website: `pfm.pl` https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/26890","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1842809428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-06T12:50:56Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

They can be found by:\r\n`document.cookie =`\r\nThey must be replaced by `set-cookie` / `set-cookie-reload` / `trusted-set-cookie-reload` scriptlet rules.\r\n\r\nThere are many old rules, so first you need to check if the site is available, and then the need for the rule.\r\n\r\n* For convenience, you can work in a separate browser\r\n* Retrieve the list of domains, clean up duplicates and check if sites exist (if redirects occur, we assume that the site is dead).\r\n* All such rules can be merged into one file, convert them to exception rules and import as custom filter. Then go down the list and check if the rules are needed (other types of problems not related to these rules are skipped).\r\n* If the site is dead - add domains in the comment below. Then we will remove them from the filters.\r\n\r\nIn order not to overlap with other filter maintainers, it is desirable to perform batch rule replacement via pull-requests (5-10 rules per PR).\r\n\r\n### Important\r\nIt should be checked with a Dutch or German VPN, because otherwise the cookie usage messages may not appear.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1842785204","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756#issuecomment-1842785204","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756","id":1842785204,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85t1qu0","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-06T12:39:21Z","updated_at":"2023-12-06T12:39:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Dead domain: `exrapidleech.info` https://github.com/jspenguin2017/uBlockProtector/issues/167","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1842785204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-06T12:39:22Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

says\r\n> \"AdGuard cannot verify the certificate of the website since the root certificate has expired\" (Screenshot 2, 3).\r\n> \r\n> The highlighted part in Screenshot 4 should be \"AdGuard

refreshing the page.\r\n> \r\n> This issue also occurs in Safari on my Mac, and in Chrome on my Android (with AdGuard for Android 4.2).\r\n> \r\n> I have not yet found any other website causing the

continued expansion of anti-adblock features is detecting AdGuard again.\r\n> Had added the following filters which worked for a month or so:\r\n> youtube.com##+js(set, yt.config_.openPopupConfig.supportedPopups.adBlockMessageViewModel, false)\r\n> youtube.com##+js(set, Object.prototype.adBlocksFound, 0)\r\n> youtube.com##+js(set, ytplayer.config.args.raw_player_response.adPlacements, [])\r\n> youtube.com##+js(set, Object.prototype.hasAllowedInstreamAd, true)\r\n> \r\n> But now it doesn't prevent detection anymore, and even with user rules turned off, youtube still detects adguard. Updating filters and clearing cache didn't work either.\r\n> Youtube doesn't prevent the video playing with AdGuard when using Incognito as usual.\r\n> \r\n> Issue is easy to reproduce, just have AdGuard on and browse to any video on youtube's website. \r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/rxl96h89bk0w44844o8owwo0wk4s4ckv7zq0z1s4s0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/56wzuu5fm1c8goocck0gw044cccssco7hosml1skwk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.2.209\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters</details>\r\nOther extensions used: | No other adblockers","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1843695267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-06T21:10:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
