Please note this is a very recent regression that started on May 27, 2025 and prior to that all video ads were blocked. \n\nThe behaviour is different on iPhone where mobile version of YouTube in Safari is used. In that case all ads are blocked as before.\n\nIn desktop Safari, with latest AdGuard and all most up to date filters, the behaviour is different for logged in case vs viewing without logging in.\n\nIf I don't log in to my account, no video ads are displayed. When clicking on any video, it plays immediately with no spinner and no ads. \n\nIf I do log in, the behaviour changes:\n\nOnce you click on any video, the page loads and video does not play immediately. Initially, spinner is displayed for quite long time and after that an ad is displayed. You have an option to skip the ad and then the video plays normally. \n\nPlease note that Brave Browser with its default ad blocker does not display any ads and videos start immediately. Firefox with uBlock Origin also works as normal.\n\niPad Safari (latest iPadOS, Adguard Pro and filters up to date) also shows the same experience and desktop Safari.\n\nInterestingly engough Brave Browser on iPad does block all ads as before and video startup experience is different. Videos play immediately and no ads are shown.\n\nHere is some relevant systems info:\n\nmacOS 15.5 (24F74), Safari Version 18.5 (20621.2.5.11.8) with AdGuard for Safari Version 1.11.22.\n\niPadOS 18.5 with AdGuard Pro for iOS version 4.5.10 (1029)\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2937889396","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206500#issuecomment-2937889396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206500","id":2937889396,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86vHKJ0","user":{"login":"mario-grgic","id":1044216,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQyMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1044216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic","html_url":"https://github.com/mario-grgic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-grgic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-04T00:41:26Z","updated_at":"2025-06-04T00:41:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I was able to reproduce this in Private Tab by watching this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lwBJFWkGik\n\nHere is the HAR with my interaction recorded\n\n[\n\n[youtube_ads.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20582391/youtube_ads.zip)\n\n](url)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2937889396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-04T00:41:27Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> A video player that can't be put away has been popping up at DailyMail for at least the past two days. It happens on the main page and then again on any article link that I click (as shown in attached screenshot).  I have tried selecting that element to block with Adguard but it makes no difference. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b849x7zc1y8k8o4w4kgw0scg0w0ggkkpkin1jz2ovk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.10\r\nSystem version: | IOS 17.7.2\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2939162809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-04T08:45:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
