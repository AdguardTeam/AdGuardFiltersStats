The site contains banner ads and pre-roll ads. It is simple to block them, but what I want to ask is that when I block the pre-roll ad video with the `inattvhd200.xyz###video-before` filter, when I click on it to open another match broadcast from the right side, the warning to wait for the ad to end appears. What kind of filter can be used to prevent this?\r\nUsername: `@punisher018`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pb7gtfo3m8gckkwgk8cw0ogg00c00go4fx6p15ez9y.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.13\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880)\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdBlockID","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175056/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-16T15:01:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

But if you copy/paste the link, it will paste Google’s full tracking version.  It will also use this Google tracking link if you click the article title, rather than going directly to the destination link.
