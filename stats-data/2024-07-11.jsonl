For some reason MangaDex now no longer allows me to access it and it shows what’s in the image. I have been MangaDex for a while and that could be the reason why it’s doing this.\r\n> \r\n> I tried everything like: updating filters, clearing cache and cookies, turning my iPad off and on, reconnecting to the Wi-fi, turning content blockers and extensions on and off, asking for help of how to actually fix the issue, but none of these methods seem to work.\r\n> \r\n> I’m not sure if this issue is due AdGuard interfering, but I don’t think that’s the case cause way before accessing and browsing on MangaDex was completely fine, even with AdGuard and no VPN. But now it decides to do this, it turns out some people are having this issue as well, though it’s possible some are not using AdGuard.\r\n> \r\n> Right now I’m asking for how to fix this issue, clearing cache and cookies won’t do anything as it did make things a bit worse, I don’t want to use a VPN because there are other sites that I like using and I fear it will cause the ‘Safari can’t open this page because it cannot access a secure network to the server’ issue.\r\n> \r\n> Are there any other solution to this issue, because I know there are sites that have this problem as well and can be resolved. Please help.\r\nUsername: `@Ian Chen`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/a3thw2aqh2wwow84ogwsscw44ckcggsbl3q3ibsbpc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bnz17ikjgjk048s4ko8cgw4s0g8wwscamt4pimt1wg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.5\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`, `default`, `(Regular)`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183385/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-11T00:27:31Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
