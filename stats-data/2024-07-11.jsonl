For some reason MangaDex now no longer allows me to access it and it shows what’s in the image. I have been MangaDex for a while and that could be the reason why it’s doing this.\r\n> \r\n> I tried everything like: updating filters, clearing cache and cookies, turning my iPad off and on, reconnecting to the Wi-fi, turning content blockers and extensions on and off, asking for help of how to actually fix the issue, but none of these methods seem to work.\r\n> \r\n> I’m not sure if this issue is due AdGuard interfering, but I don’t think that’s the case cause way before accessing and browsing on MangaDex was completely fine, even with AdGuard and no VPN. But now it decides to do this, it turns out some people are having this issue as well, though it’s possible some are not using AdGuard.\r\n> \r\n> Right now I’m asking for how to fix this issue, clearing cache and cookies won’t do anything as it did make things a bit worse, I don’t want to use a VPN because there are other sites that I like using and I fear it will cause the ‘Safari can’t open this page because it cannot access a secure network to the server’ issue.\r\n> \r\n> Are there any other solution to this issue, because I know there are sites that have this problem as well and can be resolved. Please help.\r\nUsername: `@Ian Chen`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/a3thw2aqh2wwow84ogwsscw44ckcggsbl3q3ibsbpc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bnz17ikjgjk048s4ko8cgw4s0g8wwscamt4pimt1wg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.5\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`, `default`, `(Regular)`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183385/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-11T00:27:31Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

recently started, I can get to the main site but no articles will load, the entire page is blank. On iOS (and previously on Mac) there's an error message that just states a problem repeatedly occurred. I've tried clearing Safari's caches & cookies, completely disabling AdGuard DNS and AdGuard and the network filter in system settings and removed all user rules for the site specifically and disabled user filters. The site works (with its profusion of ads) in Safari using a different user account and in other browsers with and without AdGuard installed (I just can't import my settings to AdGuard in Firefox to compare apples to apples). Quitting AdGuard and DNS doesn't resolve the problem either. I've also tried clearing any of  Safari's settings for the site and it still won't load.\r\nUsername: `@Eric Johnson`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/irostwszepwgkgcggogo8sk08kog0kk6hz78rknjvo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bzt4f0gfzj4kok04og80oksccc8kw40aszc3mm48v4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/cv82oa5oic08k04wogcckog0swkogkkncw42na6qkg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.14.1.1603 release\r\nSystem version: | Mac OS 14.5\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/mac_v2/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdBlockID\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)<br>AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183274/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-11T16:49:23Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Also, don't see it if I disable the AdGuard Popup Blocker script in ADG Windows.\r\n> So what's actually the benefit of this script? So far I only faced annoyance like this with the script giving me multiple notifications on some websites while the ADG Extension just silently blocks them. \r\n> What's the downside of disabling it
