I noticed one big problem after updating the filters. That annoying pay or consent banner was gone, but the problem was that most of the items on the site, with the exception of the few above, didn't respond when I clicked on them.\r\nCurrent clickable items:\r\nLANGUE FRANÇAISE\r\nDICTIONNAIRES BILINGUES\r\nTRADUCTEUR\r\nCONJUGATEUR\r\nENCYCLOPÉDIE\r\nCUISINE\r\nFORUM\r\nJEUX\r\nLIVRES\r\nCurrently unclickable items: everything except the above.\r\ne.g) Flag and language items in the centre of the website\r\n\r\nAlso, on the language-specific dictionary site, you can't enter text in an empty text box.\r\nAlso when I click the button nothing happens.\r\n\r\ne.g) https://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/italien-francais\r\nhttps://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais-arabe\r\n\r\n3.
