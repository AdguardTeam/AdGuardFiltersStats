With the filter enabled, for this report, I get a blank white page instead of content. With the filters off, I get the pop-up that an adblocker has been detected. I didn't retry all the other ticker numbers with the annoyance filters enabled but I did do a few the other day and updated those tickets. They have the same behavior as what I'm experiencing here so I would assume even the untested ones would do the same. These websites are from links from the Google Discover feed.

However, same behavior has been happening with nj.com (tkt 180077) and there was a link for nj.com in the feed today so I tried it and am reporting here because of troubleshooting you wanted me to try. All third party filters are off. I went into statiatics<recent activity and tried both suceedscene.com (screenshot) and ambrosialsummit.com in the search bar. There were no results for either one.
