With the filter enabled, for this report, I get a blank white page instead of content. With the filters off, I get the pop-up that an adblocker has been detected. I didn't retry all the other ticker numbers with the annoyance filters enabled but I did do a few the other day and updated those tickets. They have the same behavior as what I'm experiencing here so I would assume even the untested ones would do the same. These websites are from links from the Google Discover feed.

However, same behavior has been happening with nj.com (tkt 180077) and there was a link for nj.com in the feed today so I tried it and am reporting here because of troubleshooting you wanted me to try. All third party filters are off. I went into statiatics<recent activity and tried both suceedscene.com (screenshot) and ambrosialsummit.com in the search bar. There were no results for either one.

With the filter enabled, for this report, I get a blank white page instead of content. With the filters off, I get the pop-up that an adblocker has been detected. I didn't retry all the other ticker numbers with the annoyance filters enabled but I did do a few the other day and updated those tickets. They have the same behavior as what I'm experiencing here so I would assume even the untested ones would do the same. These websites are from links from the Google Discover feed. They have the same exact behavior if I try to open them in the Google app as they do on Chrome\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/nlkr5rfkda8w8osww0scc4soo8o0cwgd5m1k4fwcw0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.5\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Eset security ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182605/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2210330899","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182605#issuecomment-2210330899","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182605","id":2210330899,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86DvvkT","user":{"login":"BlazDT","id":34266271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjY2Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34266271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT","html_url":"https://github.com/BlazDT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-05T07:16:54Z","updated_at":"2024-07-05T07:16:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like JS rules are working then (as those domains not showing up).\r\nPlease add these two rules to user filter (one line, one rule):\r\n```\r\ncleaveland.com,nj.com#@%#//scriptlet('abort-current-inline-script', 'document.createElement', '/admiral|String\\.fromCharCode\\(97,( )*?100,( )*?109,( )*?105,( )*?114,( )*?97,( )*?108\\)|a%64%6d%69%72%61%6c|adm%69%72%61l|%61%64m%69r%61l|-engaged[\\s\\S]*?googletag[\\s\\S]*?decodeURI/')\r\ncleaveland.com,nj.com#@%#//scriptlet('set-constant', 'admiral', 'noopFunc')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have the same behaviour for another page, just add the domain name in front of the rule seperating the other domains with ,","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2210330899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-05T07:16:55Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
