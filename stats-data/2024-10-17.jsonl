Operator\r\n\r\nI am deeply shocked and appalled by the content posted on your website. It is inconceivable that such cruel and disturbing images and videos are even allowed to exist. Depicting violence, abuse and other heinous acts is not only morally reprehensible, but also illegal.\r\n\r\nI urge you to remove this content immediately and stop the distribution of such horrific materials. It is important that we work together as a society to prevent such cruelty and hold those responsible to account.\r\n\r\nI hope that you recognize the gravity of the situation and act accordingly.
