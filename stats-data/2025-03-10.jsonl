I use our family computer so I'm not sure if somebody changed something thats affected it, but I deleted and reinstalled it, and only checked the starting filters, so I don't know if this really isn't possible to prevent anymore or if I'm missing something. Maybe Hulu updated their user agreement and that's changed its something, but I also have this installed on Windows and it works fine, last I checked.\r\nUsername: `@sendhelpthanks`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ka0u6nnpq1w0sc0g0o4gckk8s0owo4oangi67wknog.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.20\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200413/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-10T00:02:20Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
