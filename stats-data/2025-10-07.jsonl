Comment\r\n> I've been using AdGuard to block ads on YahooMail, sometimes having to do it manually until they go away at the top of the list. However, in the past few days, it seems to have stopped blocking the ads, and when I click \"Block Ads Manually\", it does absolutely nothing. Before, it would let me click around elements on the site, choosing exactly what I'm trying to block, and now it does nothing at all.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/gye7l7h9lyos0wk448k0gggks0wk0o8isyi6uy8xig.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/1t82awrnor8k484k488k04wk00o488o72mbkhxbmu0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.139 MV2\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters</details>\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `NoScript, Windows Defender`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=ext&product_version=5.1.139&system_version=Windows+10&manifest_version=2&browser=firefox&filters=1.2.6.7.8.9.13.16.109.120.202.208.224.227.235.249&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false)","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3374830660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-07T01:22:25Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
