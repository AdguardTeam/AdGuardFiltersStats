Then I've tried use Chrome Extension only & use whitelist for URL ads.google.com. \r\n> \r\n> But it doesn’t work correctly, I have broken images f.e. on the Google Ads dashboard and so. Can you help me with settings or advanced settings?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/xp6CC1H.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/lxiHW2m.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.55\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150300/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-06T12:57:23Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
