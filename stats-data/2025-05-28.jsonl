Although it was closed as \"Cannot reproduce\", I am still able to reproduce it, so I’d like to provide detailed steps.\r\n> \r\n> As I mentioned in my previous report, the issue occurs when the AdGuard Tracking Protection filter is enabled. As you may know, filter changes take some time to take effect in Safari, so please wait a few seconds or restart Safari if necessary.\r\n> \r\n> 1. Please visit https://www.nhk.or.jp and click any link while the AdGuard Tracking Protection filter is enabled. For this demo, I clicked the link highlighted in the red rectangle in the attached screenshot.\r\n> 2. You should now see that the URL includes the \"cid\" parameter. In this case, it’s \"?cid=dchk-commonheader\".\r\n> 3. Please disable the AdGuard Tracking Protection filter and visit https://www.nhk.or.jp again, then click the same link as in Step 1.\r\n> 4. You should now see that Safari loads the URL without the parameter. If the parameter is still visible, please try restarting Safari.\r\n> \r\n> I suspect this issue occurs because the AdGuard Tracking Protection filter conflicts with Safari’s tracking protection feature. If that’s the case, this issue might not be limited to https://www.nhk.or.jp, but may also occur on other websites. Although I’m not certain about this, I’ve noticed many other URLs with similar parameters. However, I haven't tested whether the AdGuard Tracking Protection filter actually affects those URLs.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you for your continued support.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/su45hdyoqf440soww8808skcc844k8s2b2g54dluxc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/469l6fjsv9kwwoogwwgcowo8o84kccsfklvyhw1o4g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.22\r\nSystem version: | macOS 15.5\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2915189011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-28T06:57:35Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
