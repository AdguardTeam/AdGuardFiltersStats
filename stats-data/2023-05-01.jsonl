Ещё банковское приложение \"ругается\", когда он включён, хотя в настройках указано не фильтровать его трафик. У меня впечатление, что после покупки лицензии adguard его работа не стала лучше; реклама в youtube и opera давят как прежде. А в Opera исчезла вдруг возможность игнорировать рекламу через \"прилеплённое\" к ней меню: сама кнопочка меню в правом верхнем углу рекламы мерестала появляться. У меня не хватает сил и времени (может и сообразительности, она уже не та) разбираться в тонкостях работы и настроек приложений без хорошего учителя рядом и в реальном времени, так что простите, если где ошибся, предоставив противоречивую информацию от непонимания самого вопроса.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/T6hNMXv.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/KLNnrcV.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 8.1.0\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.11+(54)\r\nBrowser: | Opera\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt,   DnsUserRules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149841/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-01T03:09:52Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
