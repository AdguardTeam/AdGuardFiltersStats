Though blocking pemsrv.com prevents Gelbooru from opening an actual advertisement for a popunder, it creates another tab containing the page you're currently in, which is an annoying advertisement leftover.\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [x] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [ ] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [x] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\nI don't know if there is any, I just noticed this today. This explains the issue well enough.\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\n#### If possible, a screenshot of a page or application should not be cropped too much. Otherwise, it is not always clear where the element is located\r\n\r\n0. **DO NOT** upload screenshots with sexually explicit material on GitHub directly.\\\r\n Instead, upload it to a third-party image hosting and post the link to it without preview (!) here.\\\r\n Also, mention if the link leads to NSFW content;\r\n\r\n1. Add screenshots of the problem. You can drag and drop images or paste them from clipboard\r\n\r\n    Use `<details> </details>` tag to hide screenshots under the spoiler;\r\n\r\n2. Describe the issue in detail until it is absolutely clear from the screenshot what the problem is\r\n\r\n    You can also indicate any other information that you think the developers should know.\r\n\r\n**Warning:** Please remove personal information before uploading screenshots!\r\n\r\n1.

Comment\r\n> При включенной фильтрации только на этом сайте если включить сортировку по новизне, в любом из разделов при пролистывании страницы вниз страница сама начинает прокручиваться вверх и вниз, такое происходит только если включена сортировка по новизне. Эта проблема уже около полугода (как то была ранее и я создавал обращение в тех. поддержку и её исправляли, но она вернулась через несколько лет). Если отключить фильтрацию на 30 сек. и прокрутить страничку до первой подгрузки новых объявлений то страничка прокручивается нормально и по истечении 30 сек подгрузка рекламных миниатюр вместо иконок объявлений прекращается (то есть всё работает как положено, до обновления странички например по F5 или перехода в другую категорию объявлений и выборе сортировки по новизне). Очень надеюсь что в следующем релизе это исправят так как ждать устал и написал обращение.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Comment\r\n> При включенной фильтрации только на этом сайте если включить сортировку по новизне, в любом из разделов при пролистывании страницы вниз страница сама начинает прокручиваться вверх и вниз, такое происходит только если включена сортировка по новизне. Эта проблема уже около полугода (как то была ранее и я создавал обращение в тех. поддержку и её исправляли, но она вернулась через несколько лет). Если отключить фильтрацию на 30 сек. и прокрутить страничку до первой подгрузки новых объявлений то страничка прокручивается нормально и по истечении 30 сек подгрузка рекламных миниатюр вместо иконок объявлений прекращается (то есть всё работает как положено, до обновления странички например по F5 или перехода в другую категорию объявлений и выборе сортировки по новизне). Очень надеюсь что в следующем релизе это исправят так как ждать устал и написал обращение.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n

Comment\r\n> При включенной фильтрации только на этом сайте если включить сортировку по новизне, в любом из разделов при пролистывании страницы вниз страница сама начинает прокручиваться вверх и вниз, такое происходит только если включена сортировка по новизне. Эта проблема уже около полугода (как то была ранее и я создавал обращение в тех. поддержку и её исправляли, но она вернулась через несколько лет). Если отключить фильтрацию на 30 сек. и прокрутить страничку до первой подгрузки новых объявлений то страничка прокручивается нормально и по истечении 30 сек подгрузка рекламных миниатюр вместо иконок объявлений прекращается (то есть всё работает как положено, до обновления странички например по F5 или перехода в другую категорию объявлений и выборе сортировки по новизне). Очень надеюсь что в следующем релизе это исправят так как ждать устал и написал обращение.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/900gyo4o2eosgcg8wwcgsw4k4c4wo4oblmwgg6xbz4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/f9j1l03offccg8w0cc8s8ws440kgs4k62okht2xsi4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.2 (4988)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.19045.0\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`, `User rules (url: none)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nCustom filters: | User rules (url: none)\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nReferrer: | [https://youla.ru/all/dom-dacha?attributes[sort_field]=date_published](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoula.ru%2Fall%2Fdom-dacha%3Fattributes%5Bsort_field%5D%3Ddate_published)\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.info/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.custom_bootstrap=&dns.custom_fallback=&dns.custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_mode=System&dns.filters=1&dns.servers=System&dns.timeout=0&extensions=AdGuard%2520Extra%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29%2CAdGuard%2520Popup%2520Blocker%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fpopup-blocker%2F2.5%2Fpopupblocker.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=1.2.3.10&license_type=paid&product_type=Win&product_version=7.20.2+%284988%29&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fyoula.ru%2Fall%2Fdom-dacha%3Fattributes%5Bsort_field%5D%3Ddate_published&scheme_version=2&stealth.enabled=false&system_version=Microsoft+Windows+NT+10.0.19045.0&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F134.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&utm_campaign=report&utm_medium=assistant&utm_source=win&win.wfp=true)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201978/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201978/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-31T13:09:30Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> При включенной фильтрации только на этом сайте если включить сортировку по новизне, в любом из разделов при пролистывании страницы вниз страница сама начинает прокручиваться вверх и вниз, такое происходит только если включена сортировка по новизне. Эта проблема уже около полугода (как то была ранее и я создавал обращение в тех. поддержку и её исправляли, но она вернулась через несколько лет). Если отключить фильтрацию на 30 сек. и прокрутить страничку до первой подгрузки новых объявлений то страничка прокручивается нормально и по истечении 30 сек подгрузка рекламных миниатюр вместо иконок объявлений прекращается (то есть всё работает как положено, до обновления странички например по F5 или перехода в другую категорию объявлений и выборе сортировки по новизне). Очень надеюсь что в следующем релизе это исправят так как ждать устал и написал обращение.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Comment\r\n> При включенной фильтрации только на этом сайте если включить сортировку по новизне, в любом из разделов при пролистывании страницы вниз страница сама начинает прокручиваться вверх и вниз, такое происходит только если включена сортировка по новизне. Эта проблема уже около полугода (как то была ранее и я создавал обращение в тех. поддержку и её исправляли, но она вернулась через несколько лет). Если отключить фильтрацию на 30 сек. и прокрутить страничку до первой подгрузки новых объявлений то страничка прокручивается нормально и по истечении 30 сек подгрузка рекламных миниатюр вместо иконок объявлений прекращается (то есть всё работает как положено, до обновления странички например по F5 или перехода в другую категорию объявлений и выборе сортировки по новизне). Очень надеюсь что в следующем релизе это исправят так как ждать устал и написал обращение.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/900gyo4o2eosgcg8wwcgsw4k4c4wo4oblmwgg6xbz4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/f9j1l03offccg8w0cc8s8ws440kgs4k62okht2xsi4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.2 (4988)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.19045.0\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`, `User rules (url: none)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nCustom filters: | User rules (url: none)\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nReferrer: | [https://youla.ru/all/dom-dacha?attributes[sort_field]=date_published](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoula.ru%2Fall%2Fdom-dacha%3Fattributes%5Bsort_field%5D%3Ddate_published)\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.info/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.custom_bootstrap=&dns.custom_fallback=&dns.custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_mode=System&dns.filters=1&dns.servers=System&dns.timeout=0&extensions=AdGuard%2520Extra%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29%2CAdGuard%2520Popup%2520Blocker%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fpopup-blocker%2F2.5%2Fpopupblocker.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=1.2.3.10&license_type=paid&product_type=Win&product_version=7.20.2+%284988%29&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fyoula.ru%2Fall%2Fdom-dacha%3Fattributes%5Bsort_field%5D%3Ddate_published&scheme_version=2&stealth.enabled=false&system_version=Microsoft+Windows+NT+10.0.19045.0&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F134.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&utm_campaign=report&utm_medium=assistant&utm_source=win&win.wfp=true)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201978/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201978/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2766257445","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201978#issuecomment-2766257445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201978","id":2766257445,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86k4b0l","user":{"login":"rakleed","id":19418601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDE4NjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19418601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakleed","html_url":"https://github.com/rakleed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakleed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakleed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakleed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakleed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakleed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakleed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakleed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakleed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakleed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-31T13:35:03Z","updated_at":"2025-03-31T13:35:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Sergey-Lyapin теперь ошибки нет, и после повторной публикации первого объявления он автоматически закрывается.

Comment\r\n> При включенной фильтрации только на этом сайте если включить сортировку по новизне, в любом из разделов при пролистывании страницы вниз страница сама начинает прокручиваться вверх и вниз, такое происходит только если включена сортировка по новизне. Эта проблема уже около полугода (как то была ранее и я создавал обращение в тех. поддержку и её исправляли, но она вернулась через несколько лет). Если отключить фильтрацию на 30 сек. и прокрутить страничку до первой подгрузки новых объявлений то страничка прокручивается нормально и по истечении 30 сек подгрузка рекламных миниатюр вместо иконок объявлений прекращается (то есть всё работает как положено, до обновления странички например по F5 или перехода в другую категорию объявлений и выборе сортировки по новизне). Очень надеюсь что в следующем релизе это исправят так как ждать устал и написал обращение.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/900gyo4o2eosgcg8wwcgsw4k4c4wo4oblmwgg6xbz4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/f9j1l03offccg8w0cc8s8ws440kgs4k62okht2xsi4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.2 (4988)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.19045.0\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`, `User rules (url: none)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nCustom filters: | User rules (url: none)\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nReferrer: | [https://youla.ru/all/dom-dacha?attributes[sort_field]=date_published](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoula.ru%2Fall%2Fdom-dacha%3Fattributes%5Bsort_field%5D%3Ddate_published)\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.info/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.custom_bootstrap=&dns.custom_fallback=&dns.custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_mode=System&dns.filters=1&dns.servers=System&dns.timeout=0&extensions=AdGuard%2520Extra%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29%2CAdGuard%2520Popup%2520Blocker%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fpopup-blocker%2F2.5%2Fpopupblocker.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=1.2.3.10&license_type=paid&product_type=Win&product_version=7.20.2+%284988%29&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fyoula.ru%2Fall%2Fdom-dacha%3Fattributes%5Bsort_field%5D%3Ddate_published&scheme_version=2&stealth.enabled=false&system_version=Microsoft+Windows+NT+10.0.19045.0&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F134.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&utm_campaign=report&utm_medium=assistant&utm_source=win&win.wfp=true)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201978/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201978/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2766592369","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201978#issuecomment-2766592369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201978","id":2766592369,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86k5tlx","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-31T15:26:03Z","updated_at":"2025-03-31T15:26:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"trusted-click-element действует только 10 секунд после загрузки страницы.
