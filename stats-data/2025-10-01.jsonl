because of <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale#operations-per-run\">operations-per-run</a> then the next run will start from the first unprocessed issue skipping the issues processed during the previous run(s). The state is reset when all the issues are processed. This should be considered for scheduling workflow runs.</li>\n<li>Version 9 of this action updated the runtime to Node.js 20.

ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript.
