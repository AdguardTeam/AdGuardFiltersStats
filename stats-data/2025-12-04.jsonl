動画再生ボタン押下後アンケートが現れます。アンケートに回答せずともm3u8ファイルを取得可能なのは以前と変わりません。\r\n> \r\n> 私は日常的にTverを利用することはないので気づきませんでしたが、Tver側がいたちごっこを仕掛けてきている可能性もありそうですね。\r\n> \r\n> The questionnaire appears after a click on the play button.\r\n> An issue of the same type was previously resolved here: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184080#issuecomment-2697622576\r\n> You don't have to answer the form to extract m3u8 data of the movie, so I guess there is some way to bypass the wall without assigning a random value to each question.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1

https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/219029#issuecomment-3610709441\r\n> \r\n> Yeah, the rule\r\n> ```\r\n> ||platform-api.tver.jp/v*/api/platform_users/questionnaire?$xmlhttprequest\r\n> ```\r\n> works fine. Thanks!\r\n> \r\n> As for the cookies, I checked the following:\r\n> open the page with Chrome's guest mode (logged out) → answer the questionnaire and the video plays → copy the cookies → close the page → add user rules to set the cookies with `trusted-set-cookie` scriptlet → reopen the page → then the video plays normally.\r\n> This might mean that information on cookies is saved on the server side?\r\n> If so, then after a certain period time it would be lost?\r\n> \r\n> I also found two other issues:\r\n> \r\n> 1. The video quality setting \"画質\" on the player appears on Chrome, but not on Safari (even with the following all off: the content blocker of Safari, prevent cross-site tracking, hide IP address from trackers, use advanced tracking and fingerprinting protection). This might be Safari's bug or something?\r\n> \r\n> 2. A bug in AdGuard's Assistant, as commented in https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/219352#issuecomment-3606152400 : when reporting an issue, you cannot go forward until adding Annoyances filter to the filter list manually, even if you've already enabled it. Perhaps this is related     to the fact that Annoyances filter is now regarded as a custom filter?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/hcm66tgyxy8kwk8skkk44s8w48o8w0w34wuk0293ds.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.17.3.2020 release\r\nSystem version: | `バージョン15.7.1（ビルド24G231）`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (0), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header<br><br>**Browser API**:<br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter</details>\r\nCustom filters: | `AdGuard Annoyances filter (url: https://filters.adtidy.org/mac_v2/filters/14.txt)`\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | `AdGuard Assistant (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js)`<br>`Web of Trust (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js)`<br>`AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)`<br>`AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)`<br>`tinyShield (url: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@filteringdev/tinyshield@latest/dist/tinyShield.user.js)`\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=mac&product_version=2.17.3.2020+release&system_version=%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B315.7.1%EF%BC%88%E3%83%93%E3%83%AB%E3%83%8924G231%EF%BC%89&browser=chrome&filters=1.2.3.4.6.7.8.9.13.16.17.105.108.109.224.227.243.14&custom_filters=AdGuard%2520Annoyances%2520filter%2520%28url%253A%2520https%253A%252F%252Ffilters.adtidy.org%252Fmac_v2%252Ffilters%252F14.txt%29&dns_servers=https%3A%2F%2Fdns.adguard-dns.com%2Fdns-query&userscripts=AdGuard%2520Assistant%2520%28url%253A%2520https%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fassistant%252F4.3%252Fassistant.user.js%29%252C%250AWeb%2520of%2520Trust%2520%28url%253A%2520https%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fadguard-wot%252F1.0%252Fwot.user.js%29%252C%250AAdGuard%2520Popup%2520Blocker%2520%28url%253A%2520https%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fpopup-blocker%252F2.5%252Fpopupblocker.user.js%29%252C%250AAdGuard%2520Extra%2520%28url%253A%2520https%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fadguard-extra%252F1.0%252Fadguard-extra.user.js%29%252C%250AtinyShield%2520%28url%253A%2520https%253A%252F%252Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%252Fnpm%252F%2540filteringdev%252Ftinyshield%2540latest%252Fdist%252FtinyShield.user.js%29&dns.filters=AdGuard%2520DNS%2520filter&dns.filters_enabled=true&dns.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.webrtc=true&stealth.push=true&stealth.location=true&stealth.java=true&stealth.strip_url=true&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.referrer=&stealth.user_agent=&stealth.x_client=true&stealth.dpi=true&stealth.third_party_cookies=0&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=true&stealth.block_third_party_auth=true&stealth.block_trackers=true&referrer=&scheme_version=3&adblocking.enabled=true&dns.timeout=2000)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3611670282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-12-04T11:23:10Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
