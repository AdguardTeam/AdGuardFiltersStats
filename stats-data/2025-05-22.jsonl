The goal is to enable AdGuard to effectively manage and filter the network traffic from these applications, bypassing SSL pinning limitations in a secure and user-consented manner. This would greatly enhance AdGuard's utility in blocking ads and tracking elements within popular apps that currently resist traditional filtering techniques due to SSL pinning. I believe such functionality, if implemented responsibly, would be highly valuable for advanced users who wish to maintain privacy and control over their network traffic which is not possible without rooting the device.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\ncreating an apps that bypasses ssl pinning of social media. (tiktok,snapchat,insta,facebook,etc...) same as github # @[https://github.com/Eltion/Tiktok-SSL-Pinning-Bypass](url) ,whole people worldwide are concerned about their privacy while using their android/ios phones and ready to pay to hide their data , and block trackers which is not possible without the sslpinning bypassing plus modification of the social media apps to make them routed thru adguard without rooting their phone.\n\n### Additional information\n\nmodern phones are hard to be rooted because their firmware is about 50 gb plus.. rooting phones can break it  which is neeeded to block trackers and ads well in encrypted traffic for phones , we are in 2025 people useses phones most of time unlike other devices... currently github versions of the apps that bypass sslpinning are outdated and some the rest doesn't even work ... so i hope one day there be a solution\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80e1da79-f451-4c3b-967f-0e3536a2c50f)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206024/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-22T18:38:41Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

The issue can be seen when connecting to a network that has the dns configured with 94.140.14.14/94.140.15.15.  When connected to a network with that dns, apps such as gmail on android, are unable to send or receive any new emails.  If you disconnect from the network with that DNS emails will begin syncing again.  This is also an issue when running on mobile networks and using the private network dns.adguard-dns.com on the device.  If you remove the private network, syncing begins again.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/s2dd9mof15c808ko0080c88wo40wgsg2wslr3pyhh4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3yypfn41so6cw408o8wcg4o8w00gkw8g6jstku6a74.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nBrowser: | Gmail Android App","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206028/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-22T20:18:42Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
