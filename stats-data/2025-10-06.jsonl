Comment\r\n> Steps to Reproduce the Issue\r\n> \r\n> Open the affected webpage in Safari. e.g (https://www.lululemon.com.hk/en-hk/p/softstreme-full-zip-hoodie-long/prod20003819.html?dwvar_prod20003819_color=020392)\r\n> \r\n> Click on a color option ( color selector).\r\n> \r\n> Attempt to click another color option — the page becomes unresponsive and no further actions are possible.\r\n> \r\n> At this point, keyboard input still works (e.g., pressing Command + A selects all text on the page).\r\n> \r\n> Noticed that AdGuard extension is installed and active, but disabled for this website.\r\n> \r\n> Fully deactivating the AdGuard extension in Safari settings resolves the issue — the color options can then be clicked without the page freezing.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

click another color option — the page becomes unresponsive and no further actions are possible.\r\n> \r\n> At this point, keyboard input still works (e.g., pressing Command + A selects all text on the page).\r\n> \r\n> Noticed that AdGuard extension is installed and active, but disabled for this website.\r\n> \r\n> Fully deactivating the AdGuard extension in Safari settings resolves the issue — the color options can then be clicked without the page freezing.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [https://www.yahoo.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Prior to the most recent update, i had setup custom the previous version blocked the ads but left empty spaces as per the screenshot i shared.  I manually blocked all the individual \"empty\" ad spaces using manual/custom rules and the yahoo page was ad free and no random spaces.  AFTER the update to the most recent version, the ads themselves were blocked but the random \"ad\" spaces remained.  I manually blocked all those random spaces again with custom block rules.  But, the yahoo auto-refreshes and every time, the \"empty ad\" spaces return despite of how many times I block them.  Its not an issue, more like an FYI for you guys.
