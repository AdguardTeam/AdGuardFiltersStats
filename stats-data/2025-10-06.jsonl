Comment\r\n> Steps to Reproduce the Issue\r\n> \r\n> Open the affected webpage in Safari. e.g (https://www.lululemon.com.hk/en-hk/p/softstreme-full-zip-hoodie-long/prod20003819.html?dwvar_prod20003819_color=020392)\r\n> \r\n> Click on a color option ( color selector).\r\n> \r\n> Attempt to click another color option — the page becomes unresponsive and no further actions are possible.\r\n> \r\n> At this point, keyboard input still works (e.g., pressing Command + A selects all text on the page).\r\n> \r\n> Noticed that AdGuard extension is installed and active, but disabled for this website.\r\n> \r\n> Fully deactivating the AdGuard extension in Safari settings resolves the issue — the color options can then be clicked without the page freezing.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

click another color option — the page becomes unresponsive and no further actions are possible.\r\n> \r\n> At this point, keyboard input still works (e.g., pressing Command + A selects all text on the page).\r\n> \r\n> Noticed that AdGuard extension is installed and active, but disabled for this website.\r\n> \r\n> Fully deactivating the AdGuard extension in Safari settings resolves the issue — the color options can then be clicked without the page freezing.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
