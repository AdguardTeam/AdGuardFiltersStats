left all settings options in the bug report form as is, b/c the AdGuard add-on is disabled for the web site (but enabled on the Add-Ons page).  Also, it used to auto-populate the current settings in the form, but it didn’t do it this time.\r\n> \r\n> For several months, the Allowlist in the Firefox add-on has not been working properly on Amazon.  When it’s disabled in the toolbar icon (and in the Allowlist), the Legitimate URL Shortener and AdGuard URL Tracking filter (if enabled) in the “Privacy” section still both block all sponsored product links that contain '$' and '&' special characters in the URL.  This doesn’t happen in AdGuard for Safari, b/c these filters are not included in this version.\r\n> \r\n> https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DHZRW4Q – Click on any of the sponsored links in the “Products related to this item” section below the product, and they all return the error “Sorry, we couldn’t find that page”.  When I disable these 2 filters, they all load fine.\r\n> \r\n> Also, why doesn’t AdGuard for Safari also include these filters, or have an essential Tracking Protection section like the Firefox add-on does?\r\n> \r\n> Additionally, on the “Share your settings” page when reporting an issue, it should include an option for “None” (no filters enabled), rather than requiring you to remove all filters from the list.\r\n> \r\n> Thanks\r\nUsername: `@shape55`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/cwgxprnd5n48csg0ssos08wgg8k80k8km8nq62dveo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ajcg9d27mqok0g0ss4k8008kso00o0c7sxg6tq4xlg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.49 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Mac OS 10.15\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>IndianList</details>\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | All add-ons other than AdGuard were disabled before testing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2620511584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-01-29T02:49:09Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

You can add that to the rule.","created_at":"2025-01-29T07:56:24Z","updated_at":"2025-01-29T07:56:24Z","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pull/197325#discussion_r1933406277","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pulls/197325","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pulls/comments/1933406277"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pull/197325#discussion_r1933406277"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pulls/197325"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pulls/comments/1933406277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":317,"original_start_line":317,"start_side":"RIGHT","line":319,"original_line":319,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":1933387668,"original_position":7,"position":7,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pulls/197325","id":2303862895,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAVlsM86JUihv","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pull/197325","diff_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pull/197325.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pull/197325.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197325","number":197325,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Fix #197308 woltair.pl","user":{"login":"ntnguyen1234","id":23257168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjU3MTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23257168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234","html_url":"https://github.com/ntnguyen1234","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"body":"# Creating the pull request\r\n\r\n> Please include a summary of the change and which issue is fixed\\\r\n> If the related issue does not exist in our repository, please create it before making pull request\\\r\n> It is highly recommended to use our [Web Reporting Tool](https://kb.adguard.com/technical-support/reporting-tool) instead of creating an issue on GitHub directly\\\r\n> Please note, that we verify every pull request manually, so it may take time to apply it\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### To avoid invalid pull requests, please check and confirm following terms\r\n\r\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report;\r\n- [x] My code follows the [guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [ ] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [ ] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [x] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\n\r\n### Enter the issue address\r\n\r\n[#197308](https://www.github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197308)\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\n#### If possible, a screenshot of a page or application should not be cropped too much.
