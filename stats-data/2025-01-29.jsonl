left all settings options in the bug report form as is, b/c the AdGuard add-on is disabled for the web site (but enabled on the Add-Ons page).  Also, it used to auto-populate the current settings in the form, but it didn’t do it this time.\r\n> \r\n> For several months, the Allowlist in the Firefox add-on has not been working properly on Amazon.  When it’s disabled in the toolbar icon (and in the Allowlist), the Legitimate URL Shortener and AdGuard URL Tracking filter (if enabled) in the “Privacy” section still both block all sponsored product links that contain '$' and '&' special characters in the URL.  This doesn’t happen in AdGuard for Safari, b/c these filters are not included in this version.\r\n> \r\n> https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DHZRW4Q – Click on any of the sponsored links in the “Products related to this item” section below the product, and they all return the error “Sorry, we couldn’t find that page”.  When I disable these 2 filters, they all load fine.\r\n> \r\n> Also, why doesn’t AdGuard for Safari also include these filters, or have an essential Tracking Protection section like the Firefox add-on does?\r\n> \r\n> Additionally, on the “Share your settings” page when reporting an issue, it should include an option for “None” (no filters enabled), rather than requiring you to remove all filters from the list.\r\n> \r\n> Thanks\r\nUsername: `@shape55`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/cwgxprnd5n48csg0ssos08wgg8k80k8km8nq62dveo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ajcg9d27mqok0g0ss4k8008kso00o0c7sxg6tq4xlg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.49 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Mac OS 10.15\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>IndianList</details>\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | All add-ons other than AdGuard were disabled before testing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2620511584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-01-29T02:49:09Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
