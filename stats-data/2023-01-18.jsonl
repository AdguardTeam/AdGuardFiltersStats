The image appears in the card.\r\n> \r\n> Every once in a while an image goes through when AdGuard is on (because I forget to turn it off), but it's mostly the first one, then nothing else goes through until I turn AdGuard off. \r\n> Oftentimes I also get an error (from Trello on their website) that I am not connected to the server. Everything (creating cards, changing text etc) continues to work except for the image upload, and once AdGuard is off there are no more server error messages on the Trello site either. \r\n> Note that all my Trello pages are affected by this issue, not just the \"Rezepte\" one from the screenshots.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/27u9kQt.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9IRBpWq.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Germany\r\nOther extensions used: | Extensions: 1Password Beta, AdGuard AdBlocker, Download Manager (S3), Evernote Web Clipper, Nervenschoner (Adblocker, but I disabled that and the issue persists), Perfect Home, Save to Pocket (mini), The Camelizer // Anti-virus: Bitdefender Antivirus Free","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/139468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/139468/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1386952381","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/139468#issuecomment-1386952381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/139468","id":1386952381,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85Sqza9","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-18T12:09:39Z","updated_at":"2023-01-18T12:09:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please test in user rules:\r\n`@@||api-gateway.trello.com^`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1386952381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-01-18T12:09:40Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Jeżeli ktoś wchodzi tylko na jastrzabpost a nie wchodzi na inne domeny WP, to pokaże się komunikat. Znika dopiero wtedy gdy wejdziemy na jakąś inną domenę WP, gdzie ten komunikat chyba zatwierdzi reguła zbiorcza i odświeżymy.  Wyczyść u siebie wszystkie cookies z WP i ich domen i od razu wejdź na jastrząb a zobaczysz o co chodzi.  W przyszłości musicie takie okoliczności sprawdzać, bo jak widać jest nierozpoznany, może mało istotny ale problem. \r\n> Mam też nadzieje a tego nie wiem, że przy zatwierdzaniu cookies przez regułę, gdy w komunikacie jest wybór zgody czy niezgody na przetwarzanie i zbieranie danych, to zawsze powinno być najpierw auto klikane wszystkie przyciski sprzeciwów na wszystko i dopiero przycisk Zapisz. Jeżeli jeszcze tak nie ma, to czym prędzej pracujcie na tym, bo to bardzo istotne.
