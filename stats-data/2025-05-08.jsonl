It wraps actual stream links for example like:\r\n> \r\n> `javascript:void(window.open('https://advsmedia.xyz/live/?t=Flash&link=https://wikisport.best/embed/bt1.php&id=357889&w=https://vipbox.to/%27,%27ddd%27,%27width=1000,height=900%27))`\r\n> \r\n> The stream appears to be hosted at `https://wikisport.best/embed/bt1.php`, but it is embedded through advsmedia.xyz, which adds advertising and possibly controls navigation between streams. It may be worth checking whether the ads can be separated from the functional streaming component.\r\n> \r\n> Also similar websites:\r\n> \r\n> `https://streamsports.to/`\r\n> `https://streameast.plus/`\r\n> `https://fromsport.online/`\r\n> `https://pirlotv.site/`\r\n> `https://hesgoal.games/`\r\n> `https://score808.fyi/`\r\n> `https://score808.my/`\r\n> `https://live-tv.show/`\r\n> `https://score808.watch/`\r\n> `https://808score.pro/`\r\n> `https://sportlemon.site/`\r\n> `https://jokerstreams.tv/`\r\n> `https://soccerstreams.soccer/`\r\n> `https://vipbox.watch/`\r\n> `https://sportshub.watch/`\r\n> `https://lemonsport.live/`\r\n> `https://sportplus.ws/`\r\n> `https://footybite.soccer/`\r\n> `https://footybite.me/`\r\n> `https://batmanstream.watch/`\r\n> `https://jokerlivestream.co/`\r\n> `https://sportstream.one/`\r\n> `https://sport-plus.live/`\r\n> `https://jokerlive.stream/`\r\n> `https://buffstreams.vip/`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ho42amemg5k4w4oww8k8s4sgw40csc4dauf6hm1i0g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ew5c4ci39jk8wow0okcw0c8ck8kscselm3164i0mos.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.79 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-08T15:30:09Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
