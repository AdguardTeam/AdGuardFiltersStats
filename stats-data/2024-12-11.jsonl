advertisement comes on while listening on Spotify, the Ablocker does its job and blocks the ad. However,  this only stops it from ever playing, ultimately stopping the music from playing entirely. I can't skip the blocked ad, because, well, it's an ad, but it won't play cause of the ad blocker. I understand I could turn it off when listening to Spotify, but I'd hope there would be an easier fix. The only fix other than that that I've found it restarting the whole spotofy webpage and starting my music again.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/iby0yh9y92ossk0848c0cw004cc8g8kdvokwki32ag.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hmyc2q9xkc8w044404so8os88s4g8wkjuassxdwb5s.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.0.175 MV3\r\nSystem version: | Chromium OS 14541.0.0\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Quick Fixes<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2533607823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-12-11T04:31:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
