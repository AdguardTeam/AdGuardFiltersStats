Comment\r\n> With AdGuard turned on, the Quizlet website no longer loads the sign in or sign up page, and appears as if the button was not clicked at all, even if navigating to the direct URL of the sign in page. Therefore, it is not possible to sign in to Quizlet with AdGuard turned on. With AdGuard turned off, the sign in page loads quickly as a overlay that obscures whatever page was behind it.
