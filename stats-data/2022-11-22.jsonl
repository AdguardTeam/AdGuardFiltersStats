I figured I should give a quick headsup that the attempt to add whitelistings in AdGuard Base for `/adservice.` currently aren't working entirely correctly, since uBO would sync List-KR from its own extension settings, instead of while the browser GUI is visiting any of the three `$domain=~` domains.\r\n\r\nI see two possible fixes:\r\n*My recommended way:* `@@/adservice.txt?_=` (Appears to work correctly in Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List.) + potentially `@@||adservice.io^$~third-party`?\r\n*An alternative way:* `@@||githubusercontent.com/*/adservice.` + `@@||github.com/*/adservice.` + `@@||adservice.io^`\r\n\r\n3.
