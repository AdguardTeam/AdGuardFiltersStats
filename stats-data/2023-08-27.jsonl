Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо.
