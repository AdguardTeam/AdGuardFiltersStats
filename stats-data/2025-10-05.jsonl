I manually blocked all the individual \"empty\" ad spaces using manual/custom rules and the yahoo page was ad free and no random spaces.  AFTER the update to the most recent version, the ads themselves were blocked but the random \"ad\" spaces remained.  I manually blocked all those random spaces again with custom block rules.  But, the yahoo auto-refreshes and every time, the \"empty ad\" spaces return despite of how many times I block them.  Its not an issue, more like an FYI for you guys.  My custom block rules are rendered useless once the page refreshes every time.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @Hear AdGuard\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/ehjvqbpemvsc8o0oscgo4ow04sk4444jz7cijwa7y8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.22.0 (5225)\r\nSystem version: | `Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.26100.0`\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (2200), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests<br><br>**Browser API**:<br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (custom referer), <br>Hide your User-Agent (custom user-agent), <br>Hide your IP address (208.54.104.184), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nCustom filters: | `User rules (url: none)`\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `No anti-virus.
