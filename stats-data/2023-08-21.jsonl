Comment\r\nUsername: @115dkk\r\n> 1. I have the same problem with all galleries (bulletin boards) on a site called dcinside. The gallery I specified in the link is just one example.\r\n> \r\n> 2. intermittently, when I try to access, refresh, enter a post/comment, etc., it just loads pointlessly and never completes, as if the browser is lagging.\r\n> \r\n> 3. In that state, I can't select any links, try to refresh again, or even hit back button to go back until I get to the new tab home.\r\n> \r\n> 4. like 'namu wiki', I have a suspicion that the company is intentionally making the site difficult to use if you have adblock enabled.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/npk3eowo1hws8880kw84k4oosw40wo0btj3rewqkjc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/iw5zdzox51k4kgkwco0wwo0g4040k8o5umb8xhphjc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.14\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (30), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://***.d.adguard-dns.com,tls://254ff525.d.adguard-dns.com,https://254ff525.d.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/windows/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>List-KR, <br/>AdGuard Japanese\r\nUserscripts: | https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/List-KR/NamuLink@main/NamuLink.user.js,<br>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/List-KR/microShield@main/microShield.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/lists?id=ftl](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgall.dcinside.com%2Fmgallery%2Fboard%2Flists%3Fid%3Dftl)\r\nOther extensions used: |  Listly/DownThemAll!/Eightify/Gimme Summary/GoFullPage/Image Downloader/ShareGPT/클린디씨/프롬프트 지니/Ahnlab V3","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158328/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-21T10:17:36Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> 此网址为steam盗版网站。它会高度模仿正版steam并且引诱下载它以欺骗不知情的用户。所以我希望你们能够在用户第一次进入时予以警告和提醒。非常感谢！\r\n> This website is a Steam pirated website. It will highly imitate genuine Steam and lure download to deceive unaware users. So I hope you can provide warnings and reminders when users enter for the first time. Thank you.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/eywmvw6x41s0okss88wksgcgo8cg8s8dgsy2aos6rw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158772/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1686046409","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158772#issuecomment-1686046409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158772","id":1686046409,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85kfwbJ","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-21T10:14:00Z","updated_at":"2023-08-21T10:14:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=ps2023%E7%A0%B4%E8%A7%A3%E7%89%88&rsv_spt=1&rsv_iqid=0xa7b5935d00074da6&issp=1&f=3&rsv_bp=1&rsv_idx=2&ie=utf-8&rqlang=cn&tn=baiduhome_pg&rsv_enter=0&rsv_dl=ts_6&rsv_btype=t&rsv_t=29d2BSIDqkKmg7EfrBkVGKeWvrLszxMUJT24dOhteHWsxFxSwwhmYLWnaEdv0QWM0ZzE&oq=ps202%2526lt%253B%25E7%25A0%25B4%25E8%25A7%25A3%25E7%2589%2588&rsv_pq=83f15dfa00045d65&prefixsug=ps202%2526lt%253B%25E7%25A0%25B4%25E8%25A7%25A3%25E7%2589%2588&rsp=6](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.baidu.com%2Fs%3Fwd%3Dps2023%25E7%25A0%25B4%25E8%25A7%25A3%25E7%2589%2588%26rsv_spt%3D1%26rsv_iqid%3D0xa7b5935d00074da6%26issp%3D1%26f%3D3%26rsv_bp%3D1%26rsv_idx%3D2%26ie%3Dutf-8%26rqlang%3Dcn%26tn%3Dbaiduhome_pg%26rsv_enter%3D0%26rsv_dl%3Dts_6%26rsv_btype%3Dt%26rsv_t%3D29d2BSIDqkKmg7EfrBkVGKeWvrLszxMUJT24dOhteHWsxFxSwwhmYLWnaEdv0QWM0ZzE%26oq%3Dps202%252526lt%25253B%2525E7%2525A0%2525B4%2525E8%2525A7%2525A3%2525E7%252589%252588%26rsv_pq%3D83f15dfa00045d65%26prefixsug%3Dps202%252526lt%25253B%2525E7%2525A0%2525B4%2525E8%2525A7%2525A3%2525E7%252589%252588%26rsp%3D6)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8ph84wddxbwg8cok4co0ss4wk0ggc4cqxy1a01966o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Japanese\r\nOther extensions used: | 无","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1686046409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-21T10:14:01Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
