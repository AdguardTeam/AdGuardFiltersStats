I used only the uBlock Origin extension, with it's default settings on the mentioned version. Then I added the AdGuard URL Tracking Protection Filter and then force updated it. Then I restarted the browser, went to Amazon store US, tried opening a few items from the home page. All the URLs were complete with the default tracking params as usual. I tried after logging into amazon and even without logging in to see the same results. Other filters such as ClearURL (a bit buggy, it clears even necessary params), and Dandelion's list works just fine, and can be added on uBlock origin. Hope this gets fixed soon, I know you guys don't use hard coded lists, so if this works, I am sure will work for some other websites too, thank you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2492825888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-22T03:54:56Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
