The destinations vary, but the original URL is as follows:\r\n> ```\r\n> https://p23hxejm1.com//CPR/CPR.php?c=1843194\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> And there is the list of redirects\r\n> ```\r\n> https://vpn-center.com/cdu/ww/index.php?p1=https://click.vpn-center.com&p2=https://click.vpn-center.com/click&zoneid=1843194&connection_type=other\r\n> \r\n> https://gamdom.com/?utm_source=propellerads&utm_medium=paid\r\n> \r\n> https://ak.ptailadsol.net/4/6280799\r\n> \r\n> https://v.qiepian.vip/a/?code=QOgz0kM0WK\r\n> \r\n> https://p23hxejm1.com/r/dir?zoneid=1843194&pb=8a5ed67ac74da11ec8711dc92c75d4171724251476&psp=aosbZquUoWnIMKmW2g3EjoVTVurHhQbkoR_x36SXMNAJl4LdUHjzlpUobaWL5MWfSuUMi8GUMGDdd-TEOgc5XzsrL7rpgT565lDRcNwSjxdnQW9dRv-W-GoWr18_mMaJYUXWcPMdS0Y1IzV-cs2Kf66k-PBRNz5U6D0mLL9O1N55FnUTlCKgHUsyqwEUvIXQca-xToo2c4pLLvt2dXoWhjPv9AHiEt1djfPKrC_un9c5XUzWnSnzW_1avatabFnUMqrLok9fM3zm60C_E52rzYCfJRRX-zBUXCOxb8CNXpectOwyzVsQcoYgGk7idd0zjitvEoOwBJdk7rJeGgkU1BP6245obf1BluOC6smxo5ltrGxKLQ==&fdl=1&nojs=0&abvar=0&febuild=1.0.314&t=1&wcks=1&wgl=1&cnvs=1&os=-540\r\n> \r\n> https://fulliosdefense.com/landers/valid-vpn/lp11/index.php?lpkey=1701240627f2567738\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> I don't think you can access it anymore since it has expired, but when I look at my browser history, I can see that I was redirected from this URL.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> https://208.87.241.75/channel/UCsBoll12QILGTkmQ4PSttkw?__cpo=aHR0cHM6Ly9tLnlvdXR1YmUuY29t\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186904\r\n> \r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/5cosa9p584kkwc4808k4sggo48g088sd972x6e1xlw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.5\r\nSystem version: | 17.6\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186928/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2348026165","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186928#issuecomment-2348026165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186928","id":2348026165,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86L9Ak1","user":{"login":"rhdeceptionz","id":168719647,"node_id":"U_kgDOCg51Hw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/168719647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhdeceptionz","html_url":"https://github.com/rhdeceptionz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhdeceptionz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhdeceptionz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhdeceptionz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhdeceptionz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhdeceptionz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhdeceptionz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhdeceptionz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhdeceptionz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhdeceptionz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-13T04:51:40Z","updated_at":"2024-09-13T04:51:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Alex-302 \r\nSorry for the late. \r\nCan you read record from this HAR file? \r\nThe whole thing was 90MB, so I just cut out the session near the ad tab `http://p23hxejm1.com/ `.\r\n[#186928-cut.har.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16988536/186928-cut.har.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2348026165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-09-13T04:59:53Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

[https://lk.megafon.ru/options/categories](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Flk.megafon.ru%2Foptions%2Fcategories)\r\n### Comment\r\n> При включенном AdGuard стало блокироватся содержимое раздела каталога услуг, список категорий услуг доступных для подключения, в Личном кабинете Мегафон (ссылка на Личный кабинет https://lk.megafon.ru/) (ссылка на конкретный раздел Личного кабинета ( https://lk.megafon.ru/options/categories ) Как в мобильном приложении (версия мобильного приложения актуальная последняя 4.56.0, скачано с официального сайта Мегафон (со страницы https://moscow.megafon.ru/help/lk/ ) в виде apk-файла, но это приложение есть также в разных магазинах приложений, но в Google Play его давно уже нет по понятным причинам) так и в веб-версии Личного кабинета Мегафон через браузер. Причем проблема воспроизводится и при переключении браузера в режим принудительного просмотра страниц в режиме для ПК, так что хотя непосредственно с ПК на Windows я не проверял пока, но скорее всего соответственно проблема затрагивает и ПК, поэтому и фикс нужен не только для Adguard для Android но и общий с Adguard для Windows. Проблему обнаружил вчера вечером перед сном, до недавнего времени такого точно не было, хотя и не факт что появилось вчера а не на днях. Проблема очень критичная и наверняка затрагивает очень много пользователей AdGuard, поскольку и пользователей у AdGuard и клиентов у Мегафона очень много, и требует фикса как можно скорее.\r\nUsername: `@NUser2018`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/h5d5yililigogg4gs4kw4w44gsw8ckc15u6vp4z5ph.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/afybe4o2ahkck4s8880408g4scwwkooqvx1hdrca6o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/sm9hhe1h9msksog0s44ww84k48gsgs8tu6w5fpjmxw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jpo8iqwt81csc800sowog8gsow0w8wws79t17erxqs.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.6.2\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.google/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/187988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/187988/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2348487104","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/187988#issuecomment-2348487104","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/187988","id":2348487104,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86L-xHA","user":{"login":"NUser2018","id":43743908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQzOTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43743908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018","html_url":"https://github.com/NUser2018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-13T09:31:38Z","updated_at":"2024-09-13T09:31:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Alex-302 Ну есть хорошие новости. :) На стороне Adguard я так понимаю ничего не менялось по данной проблеме?

AdGuard стало блокироватся содержимое раздела каталога услуг, список категорий услуг доступных для подключения, в Личном кабинете Мегафон (ссылка на Личный кабинет https://lk.megafon.ru/) (ссылка на конкретный раздел Личного кабинета ( https://lk.megafon.ru/options/categories ) Как в мобильном приложении (версия мобильного приложения актуальная последняя 4.56.0, скачано с официального сайта Мегафон (со страницы https://moscow.megafon.ru/help/lk/ ) в виде apk-файла, но это приложение есть также в разных магазинах приложений, но в Google Play его давно уже нет по понятным причинам) так и в веб-версии Личного кабинета Мегафон через браузер. Причем проблема воспроизводится и при переключении браузера в режим принудительного просмотра страниц в режиме для ПК, так что хотя непосредственно с ПК на Windows я не проверял пока, но скорее всего соответственно проблема затрагивает и ПК, поэтому и фикс нужен не только для Adguard для Android но и общий с Adguard для Windows. Проблему обнаружил вчера вечером перед сном, до недавнего времени такого точно не было, хотя и не факт что появилось вчера а не на днях. Проблема очень критичная и наверняка затрагивает очень много пользователей AdGuard, поскольку и пользователей у AdGuard и клиентов у Мегафона очень много, и требует фикса как можно скорее.\r\nUsername: `@NUser2018`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/h5d5yililigogg4gs4kw4w44gsw8ckc15u6vp4z5ph.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/afybe4o2ahkck4s8880408g4scwwkooqvx1hdrca6o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/sm9hhe1h9msksog0s44ww84k48gsgs8tu6w5fpjmxw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jpo8iqwt81csc800sowog8gsow0w8wws79t17erxqs.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.6.2\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.google/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/187988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/187988/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2348796397","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/187988#issuecomment-2348796397","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/187988","id":2348796397,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86L_8nt","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-13T12:05:54Z","updated_at":"2024-09-13T12:05:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ок.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2348796397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-09-13T12:05:55Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

The destinations vary, but the original URL is as follows:\r\n> ```\r\n> https://p23hxejm1.com//CPR/CPR.php?c=1843194\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> And there is the list of redirects\r\n> ```\r\n> https://vpn-center.com/cdu/ww/index.php?p1=https://click.vpn-center.com&p2=https://click.vpn-center.com/click&zoneid=1843194&connection_type=other\r\n> \r\n> https://gamdom.com/?utm_source=propellerads&utm_medium=paid\r\n> \r\n> https://ak.ptailadsol.net/4/6280799\r\n> \r\n> https://v.qiepian.vip/a/?code=QOgz0kM0WK\r\n> \r\n> https://p23hxejm1.com/r/dir?zoneid=1843194&pb=8a5ed67ac74da11ec8711dc92c75d4171724251476&psp=aosbZquUoWnIMKmW2g3EjoVTVurHhQbkoR_x36SXMNAJl4LdUHjzlpUobaWL5MWfSuUMi8GUMGDdd-TEOgc5XzsrL7rpgT565lDRcNwSjxdnQW9dRv-W-GoWr18_mMaJYUXWcPMdS0Y1IzV-cs2Kf66k-PBRNz5U6D0mLL9O1N55FnUTlCKgHUsyqwEUvIXQca-xToo2c4pLLvt2dXoWhjPv9AHiEt1djfPKrC_un9c5XUzWnSnzW_1avatabFnUMqrLok9fM3zm60C_E52rzYCfJRRX-zBUXCOxb8CNXpectOwyzVsQcoYgGk7idd0zjitvEoOwBJdk7rJeGgkU1BP6245obf1BluOC6smxo5ltrGxKLQ==&fdl=1&nojs=0&abvar=0&febuild=1.0.314&t=1&wcks=1&wgl=1&cnvs=1&os=-540\r\n> \r\n> https://fulliosdefense.com/landers/valid-vpn/lp11/index.php?lpkey=1701240627f2567738\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> I don't think you can access it anymore since it has expired, but when I look at my browser history, I can see that I was redirected from this URL.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> https://208.87.241.75/channel/UCsBoll12QILGTkmQ4PSttkw?__cpo=aHR0cHM6Ly9tLnlvdXR1YmUuY29t\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186904\r\n> \r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/5cosa9p584kkwc4808k4sggo48g088sd972x6e1xlw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.5\r\nSystem version: | 17.6\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186928/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2349274187","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186928#issuecomment-2349274187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186928","id":2349274187,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86MBxRL","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-13T15:54:12Z","updated_at":"2024-09-13T15:54:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"please test `#%#//scriptlet('abort-on-property-write', '__Cpn')`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2349274187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-09-13T15:54:14Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
