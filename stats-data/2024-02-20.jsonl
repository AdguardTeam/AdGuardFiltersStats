Comment\r\n> Pornhub links in google search results cannot be middle-clicked to have them open in a new tab while the extension is active for pornhub. I tried disabling all the relevant filters, like for pop-ups but still couldn't middle-click any pornhub links on google. I didn't know how to make user rules for this specific problem, so that might still be possible somehow. Nobody wants to have ads on pornhub obviously, so they can't just disable it for pornhub entirely. I also tried disabling it on google itself by the way, but that did not have any effect, still wouldn't open.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pw8qt6yc9pcgs8ok8sc4kksc0sksogko76p56al64g.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mmdr408v4cgwcw8g884s0wc4gc44cw0d7y7sm8pr94.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.13\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 Pro, versie 22H2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>List-KR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1954100563","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050#issuecomment-1954100563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050","id":1954100563,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM850eTVT","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-20T12:21:18Z","updated_at":"2024-02-20T12:21:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> \"images\" or design elements don't get loaded properly\r\n@Neuker1984\r\n\r\nPlease read descriptions of filters.\r\nIt is caused by `Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1954100563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-20T12:21:20Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Pornhub links in google search results cannot be middle-clicked to have them open in a new tab while the extension is active for pornhub. I tried disabling all the relevant filters, like for pop-ups but still couldn't middle-click any pornhub links on google. I didn't know how to make user rules for this specific problem, so that might still be possible somehow. Nobody wants to have ads on pornhub obviously, so they can't just disable it for pornhub entirely. I also tried disabling it on google itself by the way, but that did not have any effect, still wouldn't open.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pw8qt6yc9pcgs8ok8sc4kksc0sksogko76p56al64g.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mmdr408v4cgwcw8g884s0wc4gc44cw0d7y7sm8pr94.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.13\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 Pro, versie 22H2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>List-KR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-20T12:21:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Pornhub links in google search results cannot be middle-clicked to have them open in a new tab while the extension is active for pornhub. I tried disabling all the relevant filters, like for pop-ups but still couldn't middle-click any pornhub links on google. I didn't know how to make user rules for this specific problem, so that might still be possible somehow. Nobody wants to have ads on pornhub obviously, so they can't just disable it for pornhub entirely. I also tried disabling it on google itself by the way, but that did not have any effect, still wouldn't open.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pw8qt6yc9pcgs8ok8sc4kksc0sksogko76p56al64g.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mmdr408v4cgwcw8g884s0wc4gc44cw0d7y7sm8pr94.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.13\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 Pro, versie 22H2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>List-KR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1954098118","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050#issuecomment-1954098118","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050","id":1954098118,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM850eSvG","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-20T12:19:49Z","updated_at":"2024-02-20T12:19:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@infinity-surfer Please write here\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension/issues/2489","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1954098118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-20T12:19:50Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Pornhub links in google search results cannot be middle-clicked to have them open in a new tab while the extension is active for pornhub. I tried disabling all the relevant filters, like for pop-ups but still couldn't middle-click any pornhub links on google. I didn't know how to make user rules for this specific problem, so that might still be possible somehow. Nobody wants to have ads on pornhub obviously, so they can't just disable it for pornhub entirely.

Comment\r\n> Pornhub links in google search results cannot be middle-clicked to have them open in a new tab while the extension is active for pornhub. I tried disabling all the relevant filters, like for pop-ups but still couldn't middle-click any pornhub links on google. I didn't know how to make user rules for this specific problem, so that might still be possible somehow. Nobody wants to have ads on pornhub obviously, so they can't just disable it for pornhub entirely. I also tried disabling it on google itself by the way, but that did not have any effect, still wouldn't open.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pw8qt6yc9pcgs8ok8sc4kksc0sksogko76p56al64g.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mmdr408v4cgwcw8g884s0wc4gc44cw0d7y7sm8pr94.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.13\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 Pro, versie 22H2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>List-KR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1954401387","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050#issuecomment-1954401387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050","id":1954401387,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM850fcxr","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-20T14:59:30Z","updated_at":"2024-02-20T14:59:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@infinity-surfer yes, this rule should help in this case.

Comment\r\n> Pornhub links in google search results cannot be middle-clicked to have them open in a new tab while the extension is active for pornhub. I tried disabling all the relevant filters, like for pop-ups but still couldn't middle-click any pornhub links on google. I didn't know how to make user rules for this specific problem, so that might still be possible somehow. Nobody wants to have ads on pornhub obviously, so they can't just disable it for pornhub entirely. I also tried disabling it on google itself by the way, but that did not have any effect, still wouldn't open.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pw8qt6yc9pcgs8ok8sc4kksc0sksogko76p56al64g.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mmdr408v4cgwcw8g884s0wc4gc44cw0d7y7sm8pr94.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.13\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 Pro, versie 22H2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>List-KR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1954375006","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050#issuecomment-1954375006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050","id":1954375006,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM850fWVe","user":{"login":"Neuker1984","id":104734501,"node_id":"U_kgDOBj4fJQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104734501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuker1984","html_url":"https://github.com/Neuker1984","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuker1984/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuker1984/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuker1984/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuker1984/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuker1984/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuker1984/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuker1984/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuker1984/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuker1984/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-20T14:48:34Z","updated_at":"2024-02-20T14:48:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am stupid.\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Feb 20, 2024, 14:50 LORΣL ***@***.***> wrote:\r\n\r\n> @Alex-302 <https://github.com/Alex-302> thanks but I have found the\r\n> answer, I had to use: @@||pornhub.com^$popup that @@ at the beginning\r\n> adds the rule as an exception for popups, I initially thought that it would\r\n> do that by default.\r\n>\r\n> —\r\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\r\n> <https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050#issuecomment-1954257689>,\r\n> or unsubscribe\r\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AY7B6JKPSL6EQE6UYTEYGN3YUSS25AVCNFSM6AAAAABDOJFNGKVHI2DSMVQWIX3LMV43OSLTON2WKQ3PNVWWK3TUHMYTSNJUGI2TONRYHE>\r\n> .\r\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.Message ID:\r\n> ***@***.***>\r\n>\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1954375006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-20T14:48:35Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Szukam przyczyny i nic nie mogę znaleźć, niby wszystko ustawione poprawnie, chociaż juz wcześniej nie blokowało wszystkich wideo z yotube i własnych.  Adguard nie uruchamia się automatycznie po restarcie systemu i nie aktualizuje reguł, choć te opcje są włączone .  Opcja oszczedzania energii w systemie wyłączona i dodany do wyjątków aby nie ubijalo apki a i tak czasem ubija.  watchdog też nie wznawia ochrony, więc wszystko muszę recznie robić. Mam Huawei, czytałem pliki pomocy że ich power genie jest upierdliwe, wiec nic już  od nich nie kupie. Formularz wykrywa że podobno mam włączoną opcje czyszczenia cookie firm pierwszych a nie mam. Niedziałanie zauważyłem dopiero jak  wyłączyłem kompresje  bo jej celem było przeciwdziałanie banowaniu ip z wifi. Banowali proxy data saver i musiałem czesto restartować Opere, więc użyłem łącza GSM i to było najlepsze rozwiązanie z wyłączona  kompresją i wtedy zauważyłem że nie filtrujeuser reguł ani opera ani chrome. Nie wiem co sie stało i nie mam już pomysłów co robić? Te reguły  użytkownika powinny działać na wszystkich przeglądarkach na Chromium mobile i desktop?\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/kpisrorahqock80kgcocoskcowwoco4pj6h8s16080.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.3.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 9\r\nBrowser: | Opera\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Hide your IP address (176.64.193.370), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://dns.adguard-dns.com`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish GDPR-Cookies Filters, <br/>Polish Social Filters, <br/>KAD - Anti-Scam, <br/>Polish Annoyances Filters, <br/>EasyList Polish, <br/>Polish Anti-Annoying Special Supplement, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nUserscripts: | tylko AMP był  i jest włączony \r\nOther extensions used: | nie ma","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1954320008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-20T14:21:48Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

disabled hush, still shows for me.\r\n\r\nWow, I just read the anti-adblock script, it's a nasty little virus! Registers event listeners for DOMRemoved, so if the node gets removed it recreates itself. I guess the inline script needs to be explicitly blocked from executing, it seems like it would be pretty hard to clean up everything it's doing. Unfortunately my AdGuard fu is not up to the job of experimenting with my own filters to see if I can find a solution.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm not using the correct set of filters. I don't speak German so I don't have any German filters turned on. I just looked at the commit and I see it's in `GermanFilter/sections/antiadblock.txt`.

( [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing#264](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing/issues/264) )\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n> Please check that there no another web browser extension that has adblocking feature is enabled on your web browser. It can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \r\n> Saving memory feature of your web browser or sleep feature of your operating system can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n> In this case, please re-enable AdGuard's filtering by toggling the protection toggle.\r\n> Following the instructions can be needed.\r\n\r\n### The instructions\r\n1. Force to update the filters by clicking the reload button in AdGuard Browser Extension/AdGuard mobile or update tray menu in your system tray. [^2]\r\n2. Reload the YouTube webpage without cache by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> [^3].\r\n3. Clear cache, cookies and site data of your web browser.\r\n4.

There are no other complaints. \r\n\r\nCrappy answer, as if you were blind and didn't notice that OP reported same issue (just with a different phrase put in Google search and a different link) and BlazDT fixed it for OP, because BlazDT noticed the issue,  but you didn't see any problem and added the filters again, and now you bringed the issue back for me, and you're saying again you don't see any problem.\r\n\r\n> I have two Android devices, and all good.\r\n\r\nWhat does this shitty answer \"all good\" mean?\r\nDid you try to reproduce on my `user-agent` string or not?\r\n\r\n> I assume that the problem is also related to some browser settings. \r\n\r\nYes, like I already said: related to `user-agent` string. \r\n\r\nCould you be more helpful in reproducing the issue..., I provided you my `user-agent` string in my previous comment, because I expected you to copy it and set the same `user-agent` in your browser and tell me whether you can reproduce the issue with my `user-agent `. Also I asked you what is your device/`user-agent` so that I can check whether I can reproduce the issue on my end with your `user-agent` string. \r\n\r\nCustom `user-agent` string can be set in https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/responsive_design_mode/ or alternatively can use one of plenty extensions in Firefox Desktop to set custom `user-agent`, for example https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/uaswitcher/ , I don't see any extension for Firefox Mobile, but the issue can be reproduced on Firefox Desktop with custom `user-agent` string anyway.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1955106146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-20T21:12:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
