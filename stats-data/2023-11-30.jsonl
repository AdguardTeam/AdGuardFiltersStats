Comment\r\n> Придётся вероятно отказаться от вашего приложения так как простому пользователю невозможно разобраться с настройками вашего адгуарда. Это надо закончить компьютерные курсы чтобы разобраться во всех буковках и циферках которые вы нарисовали в настройках! Неужели нельзя сделать что то проще чтобы простой чайник мог разобраться во всех фильтрах которые вы предлагаете? Купил у вас лицензию и ровно одну неделю всё работало прекрасно,но ведь лицензию я приобретал не на неделю.Вот к примеру то что на этой странице,что такое GitHub ? Это получается чтобы понять смысл вашей клинописи я вынужден пользоваться словарём? А потом через неделю опять всё сначала? Почему АВР работает безо всяких настроек,а ваш адгуард только деньги собирает за лицензию,а работает только неделю хотя лицензия годовая?\r\nUsername: `@bv47mail.ru`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hkcwucdicbkkskoow480k8kgsk0okssa2rs0s8tx6g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.15.1 (4386)\r\nBrowser: | Opera\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | TDI\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Systeвуыкенофукцпря\\фваитm`<br>filters: `питцфуекрф\\ывмфыа `\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | АВРждалвгшц0фзшывмэдшр","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1834012110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-30T15:34:38Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Scroll down the page about a third of the way. The TV Channels listed from 10, 10 Peach, 10 Bold, onwards are out of line with their channel listing. (See image). I disabled all filters and enabled one-by-one to check to find the cause and it was the 'AdGuard Base Filter'. Tested with only 'EasyList' instead and didn't have any issue with the page. Happens on both iOS and macOS in Safari and also tested with multiple devices, all the same problem with AdGuard Base Filter enabled on the AdGuard For Safari app. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/rycghlwjftww4c4s0k4c8wgwcso0wg0m5jjxs0vjnk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/k2kknwsbx8g08wocsggks4c4k0s0048f66x1as6jjw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.16\r\nSystem version: | macOS 14.1.1\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1834081984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-30T16:13:05Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
