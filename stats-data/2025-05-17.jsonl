However, over the past few months, it started showing me ads on SoundCloud and some other apps as well. I reported the issue to the AdGuard team, but I received one of the worst customer support responses ever. Their reply was: “Somehow, it has decided to show you the ads,” which made me seriously question whether they even care.\r\n> \r\n> Anyway, I did my best and tried everything I could find online, but I wasn’t able to fix the issue myself. As I mentioned, the AdGuard support team was no help at all.\r\n> \r\n> Right now, AdGuard has completely stopped working. I’m seeing ads everywhere — on YouTube, Google Chrome, various apps, and even on some social networks where I never saw ads before. I’ve attached a screenshot from YouTube, but that’s just one example — the problem is widespread.\r\n> \r\n> I have no idea what’s going on — whether AdGuard is gradually failing or there’s an issue on my end. Please have someone experienced and knowledgeable look into this, not like the previous support rep who seemed more interested in brushing me off than actually resolving the problem. I’ve also attached a link to my previous report for reference.\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236#issuecomment-2695212996\r\nUsername: `@sakciit`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oym40yq262o4wcwc08kksckc0wkcwog1pw2c5w9g1q.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.10\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Adguard Dns `<br>filters: `Adguard DNS filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2887868456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-17T00:06:49Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
