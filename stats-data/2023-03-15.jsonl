Issue URL (Anti Adblock Script)\r\n [https://www.bloomberg.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Dear AdGuard,\r\n> \r\n> I am writing to bring to your attention an issue that I have been experiencing with one of your products, particularly the ad blocking extension for Safari.\r\n> \r\n> Firstly, I would like to express my satisfaction with the extension, as it has been serving my needs for a considerable period of time, including on the Bloomberg website. However, I have noticed that after a recent update, the extension seems to be encountering some difficulties when used on the Bloomberg site.\r\n> \r\n> To be specific, the website loads a couple times, and then it goes blank white after a few seconds when the adguard is turned on. Upon inspection of the element inspector, I noticed that the site runs some CSS code that obstructs the display of the entire page when the adguard is turned on. The page then goes white, make it unusable.\r\n> \r\n> Moreover, when the adguard is turned off on the Bloomberg website, I tried to block the top element that was causing the empty white space (as shown in screenshot 1). However, the setting is not saved after reloading the website, even though I have everything saved in my custom rules that should remove the white space at the beginning of the page.\r\n> \r\n> As a loyal user of your products, I hope that you can address this issue as soon as possible. I look forward to a prompt resolution of this matter. Thank you for your excellent products.\r\n> \r\n> Yours sincerely,\r\n> Powers.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9xOt9Pq.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/s6H7W6D.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/I7L9rrG.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://reports-img.adguard.com/5dlxDCc.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.11\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List\r\nOther extensions used: | Adblock Plus","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1470509908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-15T18:04:28Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

При этом хочется убрать рекламу в пабликах, т.к. она не относится к нужному контенту и исключить назойливые плашки о регистрации. Сначала пробовал включить AdGuard в режим VPN, все работает замечательно - рекламы нет, раздражителей нет. Но при этом некоторые приложения на Android телефоне (Сбербанк, Wildberries), даже добавленные в исключения AdGuard, продолжают напоминать про VPN. Это тоже определенный раздражитель. В режиме локального HTTP прокси напоминаний про VPN нет, но \"отваливается\" DNS фильтр и AdGuard начинает пропускать рекламу и раздражители. Данная проблема присутствует и на других пабликах - \"Киномания\" просто приведена в качестве иллюстрации. В общем, добиться комфортной работы пока не удалось.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/dTAC2hx.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/DzZrRjB.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/VMWCDUS.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://reports-img.adguard.com/yJXDFhb.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://reports-img.adguard.com/gfMT43z.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.11\r\nBrowser: | Yandex\r\nAdGuard mode: | proxy\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Hide your User-Agent ()\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>RU AdList: Counters\r\nUserscripts: | Adguard Extra\r\nOther extensions used: | Не имеются","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145616/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-15T17:45:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
