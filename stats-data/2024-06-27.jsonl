I can't block the ads on the pop up website and keeps coming back each time I block any stuff on the page with the \"block ads on this website\" feature.  I'm only using adguard as my pop up blocker and ad remover. I've updated chrome recently as well as adguard. I also tried re-installing adguard to see if that was the issue and it didn't fix anything.

instantly.\r\n> \r\n> I have tried keeping Adguard enabled and disabling all filters but unfortunately, the Plex app does not work. I have to completely disable Adguard to get it to work.\r\n> \r\n> Or If I disable Route traffic through Adguard for Plex it also works.\r\n> \r\n> So it's something in Adguard core that is blocking the Plex app from loading.

it directs to a website with ads that. I can't block the ads on the pop up website and keeps coming back each time I block any stuff on the page with the \"block ads on this website\" feature.  I'm only using adguard as my pop up blocker and ad remover. I've updated chrome recently as well as adguard. I also tried re-installing adguard to see if that was the issue and it didn't fix anything.
