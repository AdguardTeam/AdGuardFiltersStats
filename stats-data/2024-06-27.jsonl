I can't block the ads on the pop up website and keeps coming back each time I block any stuff on the page with the \"block ads on this website\" feature.  I'm only using adguard as my pop up blocker and ad remover. I've updated chrome recently as well as adguard. I also tried re-installing adguard to see if that was the issue and it didn't fix anything.

instantly.\r\n> \r\n> I have tried keeping Adguard enabled and disabling all filters but unfortunately, the Plex app does not work. I have to completely disable Adguard to get it to work.\r\n> \r\n> Or If I disable Route traffic through Adguard for Plex it also works.\r\n> \r\n> So it's something in Adguard core that is blocking the Plex app from loading.

it directs to a website with ads that. I can't block the ads on the pop up website and keeps coming back each time I block any stuff on the page with the \"block ads on this website\" feature.  I'm only using adguard as my pop up blocker and ad remover. I've updated chrome recently as well as adguard. I also tried re-installing adguard to see if that was the issue and it didn't fix anything.

Comment\r\n> When using the admin panel of Taboola, a specific URL fails to load if AdGuard's language filters are enabled, even when AdGuard is disabled for the website. This issue breaks the website and prevents the report from being generated.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> AdGuard Status:\r\n> AdGuard is disabled for the website.\r\n> Language-specific filters in AdGuard are enabled.\r\n> Problem:\r\n> With language-specific filters enabled, the URL request gets blocked before it executes, causing the website to break and the report generation to fail.\r\n> When language filters are turned off, the URL loads successfully, and the network request executes correctly.\r\n> \r\n> Steps to Reproduce:\r\n> You can't reproduce it, but I'm explaining.\r\n> Disable AdGuard for the Taboola admin panel website.\r\n> Ensure language filters in AdGuard are enabled.\r\n> In the network panel URL request gets blocked, breaking the website and preventing report generation.\r\n> Disable the language filters in AdGuard.\r\n> Attempt to load the URL again and observe that it loads successfully.\r\n> \r\n> Expected Behavior:\r\n> The URL should load successfully, and the report should generate correctly even if the language filters are enabled, given that AdGuard is disabled for the website.\r\n> \r\n> URL: https://backstage.taboola.com/backstage/resources/components/requirejs/require.js\r\nUsername: `@Chetan7575`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/91zogxt5ehgck44kko88gwcog0s48k84qd3npnc2wa.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/5d6xnzxv6tc0kcsw8oc80o84ww4c0s43glz7z2op28.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.53\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880)\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182230/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2194484899","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182230#issuecomment-2194484899","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182230","id":2194484899,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86CzS6j","user":{"login":"jellizaveta","id":91964807,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXtFhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91964807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta","html_url":"https://github.com/jellizaveta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-27T11:55:29Z","updated_at":"2024-06-27T11:55:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If you switch off AdGuard, the page needs to reload so that the blocker stops applying the rules.

Comment\r\n> When using the admin panel of Taboola, a specific URL fails to load if AdGuard's language filters are enabled, even when AdGuard is disabled for the website.
