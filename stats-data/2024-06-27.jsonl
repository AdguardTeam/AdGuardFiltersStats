I can't block the ads on the pop up website and keeps coming back each time I block any stuff on the page with the \"block ads on this website\" feature.  I'm only using adguard as my pop up blocker and ad remover. I've updated chrome recently as well as adguard. I also tried re-installing adguard to see if that was the issue and it didn't fix anything.
