В чём остаётся проблема:\r\n> 1. Сбоку на серых фонах нет картинки, но если ты там нажмёшь, то на новой вкладке открывается реклама. Обозначил прямоугольниками.\r\n> 2. Нет картинки рекламы на сером фоне слева от новостей, но остаётся пустое место. Обозначил стрелочками.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/89jvd5glhm4ogscswkk8koskcw4so00f3fx0q2w5tc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.53\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>EasyList China, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2242674908","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184199#issuecomment-2242674908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184199","id":2242674908,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86FrIDc","user":{"login":"GamerXXX25","id":30142948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTQyOTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30142948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GamerXXX25","html_url":"https://github.com/GamerXXX25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GamerXXX25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GamerXXX25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GamerXXX25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GamerXXX25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GamerXXX25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GamerXXX25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GamerXXX25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GamerXXX25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GamerXXX25/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-22T10:56:55Z","updated_at":"2024-07-22T10:56:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Плохо, что не повторяется.
