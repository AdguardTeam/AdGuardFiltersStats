Comment\r\n> The problem arises because Adguard on iPhone struggles to manage iframes effectively. It lacks a specific rule to conceal the space reserved for advertisements. While on a PC, disabling the script reduces the space to zero, the scenario differs on an iPhone. Due to the persistence of the iframe, it's expected that the advertisement frame remains visible. If there's any other reason for this issue, please let me know for future reference. \r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> <center>\r\n> <iframe src=\"https://rcm-fe.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?o=9&p=12&l=ur1&category=homekitchen&banner=1BFB96RQCPEY03S6CYG2&f=ifr&linkID=b0b13f4e59bea3d444e46d5f2e86769a&t=rbbtoday2-22&tracking_id=rbbtoday2-22\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" scrolling=\"no\" border=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" style=\"border:none;\" frameborder=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\">\r\n> </center>\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/a2x1ednapmo0c0w8ok4w8skg0o40g48d8u3k4j803s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.5\r\nSystem version: | 17.5.1\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://doh.opendns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/ios/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184923/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-29T09:43:49Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

It lacks a specific rule to conceal the space reserved for advertisements. While on a PC, disabling the script reduces the space to zero, the scenario differs on an iPhone.
