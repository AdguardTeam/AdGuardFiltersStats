Comment\r\n> The problem arises because Adguard on iPhone struggles to manage iframes effectively. It lacks a specific rule to conceal the space reserved for advertisements. While on a PC, disabling the script reduces the space to zero, the scenario differs on an iPhone. Due to the persistence of the iframe, it's expected that the advertisement frame remains visible. If there's any other reason for this issue, please let me know for future reference. \r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> <center>\r\n> <iframe src=\"https://rcm-fe.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?o=9&p=12&l=ur1&category=homekitchen&banner=1BFB96RQCPEY03S6CYG2&f=ifr&linkID=b0b13f4e59bea3d444e46d5f2e86769a&t=rbbtoday2-22&tracking_id=rbbtoday2-22\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" scrolling=\"no\" border=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" style=\"border:none;\" frameborder=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\">\r\n> </center>\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/a2x1ednapmo0c0w8ok4w8skg0o40g48d8u3k4j803s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.5\r\nSystem version: | 17.5.1\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://doh.opendns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/ios/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184923/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-29T09:43:49Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

It lacks a specific rule to conceal the space reserved for advertisements. While on a PC, disabling the script reduces the space to zero, the scenario differs on an iPhone.

tracking the filtering logs, I found that the issue was caused by \"uBlock Origin - Malware Risk.\" It seems to be blocking some compromised CDNs. I enabled it because its malicious website database appears to be larger, allowing it to block sites like z-lib.id, a fake ZLibrary site. After disabling it, the websites I mentioned are now displaying correctly. I plan to temporarily disable it for 30 seconds to handle such situations in the future. Thank you very much for your testing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2256226230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-29T15:21:06Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Quando acesso o site Metrópoles (qualquer link, mas segue a página principal: https://www.metropoles.com) o uso de memória RAM sobe sem parar. Quando desativo o Adguard esse problema não ocorre. A primeira vez que isso ocorreu foi ainda no Android 11 em outro aparelho que tinha apenas 6GB de RAM e o consumo de memória ficava visível (ficava irresponsivo por algum tempo, e aí só reiniciando ou quando reduzisse o consumo de memória com o fechamento de alguns apps em segundo plano que eu conseguia mexer no aparelho e fechar o Chrome).\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pzltmmgmd6owk4k4kgcgkkg4484gow06g8271arhxk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ddfpgxix25cg04oco4gwgc4kws4kc0om92kyl7eg1w.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.6\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | disabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.cloudflare.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184796/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-29T14:53:03Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
