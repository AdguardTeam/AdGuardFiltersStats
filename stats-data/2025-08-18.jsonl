Comment\r\n> So for some reason all of a sudden last night Webtoon started getting ads again. There was an ad at the end of each comic, and the New & Hot reappeared again. I didn't change any settings in AdGuard. I was only using the general AdGuard block list before. No other site/app had ads, just Webtoon. Somehow they circumvented ad blocking. I added a handful of new lists to AdGuard including Peter Lowe's, etc., and that helped with the ad at the end of the comic, but there is still the annoying New & Hot as well as pop ups like \"buy our coins!!\" I'm not sure what happened but the app is way more annoying to use now.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/qaxswspnjo0cs4w80kc00ckwcgss8coam2e56quymw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | Private AdGuard DNS server\r\nSystem version: | `Android 15`\r\nBrowser: | It's the app\r\nBlocklists: | <b>General:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>OISD Blocklist Small, <br/>Dan Pollock's List","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210600/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3194833642","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210600#issuecomment-3194833642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210600","id":3194833642,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86-bUrq","user":{"login":"Panaikran","id":23102899,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTAyODk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23102899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Panaikran","html_url":"https://github.com/Panaikran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Panaikran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Panaikran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Panaikran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Panaikran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Panaikran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Panaikran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Panaikran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Panaikran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Panaikran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-18T01:30:41Z","updated_at":"2025-08-18T01:30:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> \"New & Hot\" is not an ad.
