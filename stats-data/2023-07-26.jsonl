Вас опять приветствует разработчик Одноклассников. У нас с начала июля идет заметный поток жалоб на зависания сайта. Сразу были подозрения на AdGuard, но не было доказательств. Наконец, один из пользователей прислал по нашей просьбе запись Performance в инструментах разработчика Chrome. Скриншот приложил. Сам файл прислать не могу, т.к. боюсь передачи каких-либо персональных данных юзера.

Вас опять приветствует разработчик Одноклассников. У нас с начала июля идет заметный поток жалоб на зависания сайта. Сразу были подозрения на AdGuard, но не было доказательств. Наконец, один из пользователей прислал по нашей просьбе запись Performance в инструментах разработчика Chrome. Скриншот приложил. Сам файл прислать не могу, т.к. боюсь передачи каких-либо персональных данных юзера. Но готов посодействовать в предоставлении дополнительной информации.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/canixe5x7zsww844gkog0s4s4k4c80clb7mzzporo0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8zf2zfguxp8gsg4w4888cowgs4w8g8ks1a9e25mrao.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-26T07:32:33Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

день! Вас опять приветствует разработчик Одноклассников. У нас с начала июля идет заметный поток жалоб на зависания сайта. Сразу были подозрения на AdGuard, но не было доказательств. Наконец, один из пользователей прислал по нашей просьбе запись Performance в инструментах разработчика Chrome. Скриншот приложил. Сам файл прислать не могу, т.к. боюсь передачи каких-либо персональных данных юзера.

Вас опять приветствует разработчик Одноклассников. У нас с начала июля идет заметный поток жалоб на зависания сайта. Сразу были подозрения на AdGuard, но не было доказательств. Наконец, один из пользователей прислал по нашей просьбе запись Performance в инструментах разработчика Chrome. Скриншот приложил. Сам файл прислать не могу, т.к. боюсь передачи каких-либо персональных данных юзера.
