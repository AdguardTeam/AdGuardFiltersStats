Вас опять приветствует разработчик Одноклассников. У нас с начала июля идет заметный поток жалоб на зависания сайта. Сразу были подозрения на AdGuard, но не было доказательств.

Вас опять приветствует разработчик Одноклассников. У нас с начала июля идет заметный поток жалоб на зависания сайта. Сразу были подозрения на AdGuard, но не было доказательств. Наконец, один из пользователей прислал по нашей просьбе запись Performance в инструментах разработчика Chrome. Скриншот приложил. Сам файл прислать не могу, т.к. боюсь передачи каких-либо персональных данных юзера. Но готов посодействовать в предоставлении дополнительной информации.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/canixe5x7zsww844gkog0s4s4k4c80clb7mzzporo0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8zf2zfguxp8gsg4w4888cowgs4w8g8ks1a9e25mrao.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-26T07:32:33Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

день! Вас опять приветствует разработчик Одноклассников. У нас с начала июля идет заметный поток жалоб на зависания сайта. Сразу были подозрения на AdGuard, но не было доказательств.

Сам файл прислать не могу, т.к. боюсь передачи каких-либо персональных данных юзера.

Вас опять приветствует разработчик Одноклассников. У нас с начала июля идет заметный поток жалоб на зависания сайта. Сразу были подозрения на AdGuard, но не было доказательств. Наконец, один из пользователей прислал по нашей просьбе запись Performance в инструментах разработчика Chrome. Скриншот приложил. Сам файл прислать не могу, т.к. боюсь передачи каких-либо персональных данных юзера. Но готов посодействовать в предоставлении дополнительной информации.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/canixe5x7zsww844gkog0s4s4k4c80clb7mzzporo0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8zf2zfguxp8gsg4w4888cowgs4w8g8ks1a9e25mrao.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1651535186","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157414#issuecomment-1651535186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157414","id":1651535186,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85icG1S","user":{"login":"sevastyanov","id":4459543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTk1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4459543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevastyanov","html_url":"https://github.com/sevastyanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevastyanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevastyanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevastyanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevastyanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevastyanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevastyanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevastyanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevastyanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevastyanov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-26T10:46:08Z","updated_at":"2023-07-26T10:46:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@zloyden вот файл настроек:\r\n\r\nhttps://disk.yandex.ru/d/cbK2MvoHir9Flg\r\n\r\nЕщё вопрос - судя по логам, конкретный юзер использует расширение chrome-extension://bieimkcgkepinadnphjpljpcfbdipofn\r\nЭто расширение явно связано с AdGuard, но структура файлов не похожа на ту, что у меня на ноутбуке.

день! Вас опять приветствует разработчик Одноклассников. У нас с начала июля идет заметный поток жалоб на зависания сайта. Сразу были подозрения на AdGuard, но не было доказательств. Наконец, один из пользователей прислал по нашей просьбе запись Performance в инструментах разработчика Chrome. Скриншот приложил. Сам файл прислать не могу, т.к. боюсь передачи каких-либо персональных данных юзера.

день! Вас опять приветствует разработчик Одноклассников. У нас с начала июля идет заметный поток жалоб на зависания сайта. Сразу были подозрения на AdGuard, но не было доказательств.

день! Вас опять приветствует разработчик Одноклассников. У нас с начала июля идет заметный поток жалоб на зависания сайта. Сразу были подозрения на AdGuard, но не было доказательств. Наконец, один из пользователей прислал по нашей просьбе запись Performance в инструментах разработчика Chrome. Скриншот приложил. Сам файл прислать не могу, т.к. боюсь передачи каких-либо персональных данных юзера. Но готов посодействовать в предоставлении дополнительной информации.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/canixe5x7zsww844gkog0s4s4k4c80clb7mzzporo0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8zf2zfguxp8gsg4w4888cowgs4w8g8ks1a9e25mrao.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1651690382","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157414#issuecomment-1651690382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157414","id":1651690382,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85icsuO","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-26T12:14:57Z","updated_at":"2023-07-26T12:14:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157414#issuecomment-1651588112 включите фильтр раздражителей, но лучше установите AdGuard Extra.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nИзвестно, что эта проблема решается с помощью AdGuard Extra.\r\n\r\nЕсли вы пользуетесь AdGuard на устройствах Windows, Mac или Android, пожалуйста, убедитесь, что AdGuard Extra включена в настройках приложения.\r\n\r\nЕсли вы используете расширение AdGuard для браузера, рекомендуется также установить AdGuard Extra.\r\n\r\n* [Установка на браузеры Chrome, Edge или другие, основанные на Chromium](https://agrd.io/adguard_extra_chrome_release)\r\n* [Установка на Firefox](https://agrd.io/adguard_extra_firefox_release)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1651690382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-26T12:14:57Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
