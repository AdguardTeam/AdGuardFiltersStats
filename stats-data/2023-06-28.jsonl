하고있습니다.\r\n> 그리고 해당 앱의 개별 Https 설정 등도 다 했고, 로그 필터링도 이상해보이는건 다 추가했습니다.\r\n> \r\n> 해당 앱 시작 시 뜨는 전체 광고가 있는데 데이터 삭제 후 하루이틀 정도 안뜨다가 다시 생깁니다.\r\n> 한번 뜨면 캐시가 남는지 계속 생겨서 그때마다 앱 데이터를 삭제해주고 있습니다.\r\n> 그러면 며칠 괜찮다가 다시 발생합니다.\r\n> 동일 시간 AdGuard 정상 작동 중이며 다른 앱들은 문제없이 적용 중이었습니다.\r\n> \r\n> 그리고 앱에서 역 정보 화면으로 들어가면 작은 광고가 계속 뜹니다.\r\n> AdGuard 를 쓰고 나선 깨져서 보일 때도 있으나 실제 광고가 나올 때도 있습니다.\r\n> 처음에 바로 뜨진 않고 1, 2초 지나서
