하고있습니다.\r\n> 그리고 해당 앱의 개별 Https 설정 등도 다 했고, 로그 필터링도 이상해보이는건 다 추가했습니다.\r\n> \r\n> 해당 앱 시작 시 뜨는 전체 광고가 있는데 데이터 삭제 후 하루이틀 정도 안뜨다가 다시 생깁니다.\r\n> 한번 뜨면 캐시가 남는지 계속 생겨서 그때마다 앱 데이터를 삭제해주고 있습니다.\r\n> 그러면 며칠 괜찮다가 다시 발생합니다.\r\n> 동일 시간 AdGuard 정상 작동 중이며 다른 앱들은 문제없이 적용 중이었습니다.\r\n> \r\n> 그리고 앱에서 역 정보 화면으로 들어가면 작은 광고가 계속 뜹니다.\r\n> AdGuard 를 쓰고 나선 깨져서 보일 때도 있으나 실제 광고가 나올 때도 있습니다.\r\n> 처음에 바로 뜨진 않고 1, 2초 지나서

@KevinGu0611\r\n> I can't open the bbs.kafan.cn when using AdGuard. I have attached screenshots and pictures of the filter logs. When opening AdGuard, the website has been in the state of checking the browser and cannot be entered. No matter how long you wait, the website is checking the browser.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/i5f5g8z0u1c8ws0ks0s8gg0c8s8cgsk5uf9og7p6wg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/d3st0k498gg8wgk0w8o80sgkg08kgkgmhbmtspr1q8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/hvrjx4spfs0g80oow400g4c04s8skg08j58gukchf4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.13 nightly 16\r\nBrowser: | Edge 114.0.1823.58 (Chromium-based)\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nCustom filters: | https://deliver.flymc.cc/rules/sophie-advanced.txt\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://bbs.kafan.cn/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbbs.kafan.cn%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | McAfee","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1611049361","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804#issuecomment-1611049361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804","id":1611049361,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85gBqmR","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-28T09:09:59Z","updated_at":"2023-06-28T09:09:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Requests from `tacool.com` are not loaded or blocked on your side, that's why the site is not loaded.

@KevinGu0611\r\n> I can't open the bbs.kafan.cn when using AdGuard. I have attached screenshots and pictures of the filter logs. When opening AdGuard, the website has been in the state of checking the browser and cannot be entered. No matter how long you wait, the website is checking the browser.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/i5f5g8z0u1c8ws0ks0s8gg0c8s8cgsk5uf9og7p6wg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/d3st0k498gg8wgk0w8o80sgkg08kgkgmhbmtspr1q8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/hvrjx4spfs0g80oow400g4c04s8skg08j58gukchf4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.13 nightly 16\r\nBrowser: | Edge 114.0.1823.58 (Chromium-based)\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nCustom filters: | https://deliver.flymc.cc/rules/sophie-advanced.txt\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://bbs.kafan.cn/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbbs.kafan.cn%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | McAfee","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1611139562","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804#issuecomment-1611139562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804","id":1611139562,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85gCAnq","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-28T10:12:55Z","updated_at":"2023-06-28T10:12:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm glad it works fine!
