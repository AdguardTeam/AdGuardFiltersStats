When I click on a new video or if a video is loaded on autoplay, I am instantly greeted with a \"content not available\" screen that disappears once I refresh the page. Ad blocking still works but I have to refresh every single video page to watch a video. Only started being an issue this week. Interestingly when I turned on \"disable webrtc\" it would only show me \"content not available\" no matter how many times I refreshed, but I've turned it off as default, and now its back to only displaying the error initially before a refresh fixes it\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/5obht0sp7n8coko48s4wgww88wok488msh9gpk89io.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/fjj3gm9cilw8480s84w0gkgg084cc8891blem42uns.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.2.800.27 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Linux x86_64`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nFilters last update: | January 16, 2026 at 09:00\r\nOther extensions used: | `none`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=ext&product_version=5.2.800.27&system_version=Linux+x86_64&manifest_version=3&browser=chrome&filters=2.10&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false&filters_last_update=2026-01-16T09%3A00%3A32)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3764954219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2026-01-18T06:00:52Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Меня зовут Иван, прошу разобраться в проблеме, или системном сбое касаемо наверное неправильной работы расширения: Все было хорошо, но в один миг, расширение Ад гуард стало блокировать на странице ВК все посты(картинки) и отображения плей листов тоже пропало: На скриншотах видно, что реклама как бы блокируется , но как то не так: при Включенном расширении пропало отображение постов(картинок) и плей листов, а при Выключенном всё да наоборот, Появилось отображение постов, и плей листов, и появилась реклама! Прошу вас разобраться с этой проблемой!!! Заранее спасибо за понимание!!\r\n```\r\nUsername: Gureev.05.2001@mail.ru\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/rjyo6vdbwmscck8skok0ook40wwkc0w3bs2f2mx1ok.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/9f9scgtbsb8cgwg4o4008cwgcwc4g0gcbayq0ouo28.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.2.800.27 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Яндекс Браузер\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880)\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nCustom filters: | `Браузерное расширение AdGuard`\r\nFilters last update: | January 16, 2026 at 09:00\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.info/settings/import.html?product_type=ext&product_version=5.2.800.27&system_version=Windows+10&manifest_version=3&browser=yandex&browser_detail=Yandex&filters=1.2.3.5.11.17.19.21.23.208.224.255.256.257.259&custom_filters=%25D0%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%2520%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2520AdGuard&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.strip_url=true&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_trackers=true&filters_last_update=2026-01-16T09%3A00%3A32)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3765431090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2026-01-18T15:52:29Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

In AdGuard it is marked as recommended.\n\nI've disabled AdGuard base filter, and enabled Dandelion Sprout Nordic filter and/or Frellwits Swedish filter = ads are playing\n\nIf I have enabled AdGuard base filter + Dandelion or Frellwits filter = \"turn off your adblocker\" message.\n\n**So either way it doesn't work. Something in AdGuard base filter makes the player recognise you have a ad blocker running. And the local filters does nothing to stop the ads from playing.** \n\n\n1. Are you using AdGuard mini + safari, on a Mac?\n\n2. A few months ago I just blocked ***.prism-ads-cdn.a2d.tv** on dns level, and no ads would play. But if you do it now, the player freezes on a buffer page. So they must have changed how things work.
