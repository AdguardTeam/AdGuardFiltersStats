When I click on a new video or if a video is loaded on autoplay, I am instantly greeted with a \"content not available\" screen that disappears once I refresh the page. Ad blocking still works but I have to refresh every single video page to watch a video. Only started being an issue this week. Interestingly when I turned on \"disable webrtc\" it would only show me \"content not available\" no matter how many times I refreshed, but I've turned it off as default, and now its back to only displaying the error initially before a refresh fixes it\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/5obht0sp7n8coko48s4wgww88wok488msh9gpk89io.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/fjj3gm9cilw8480s84w0gkgg084cc8891blem42uns.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.2.800.27 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Linux x86_64`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nFilters last update: | January 16, 2026 at 09:00\r\nOther extensions used: | `none`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=ext&product_version=5.2.800.27&system_version=Linux+x86_64&manifest_version=3&browser=chrome&filters=2.10&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false&filters_last_update=2026-01-16T09%3A00%3A32)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3764954219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2026-01-18T06:00:52Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
