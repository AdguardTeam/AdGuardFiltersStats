Yes, you do have to finish a race before going to the home page.

The bigger problem here is that I do not have the annoyance filters activated. What I discovered is that when I turn on the annoyance filter (the overall toggle), it breaks the website in question. But, when I turn off and on all of the filters (not including the annoyance filter), it fixes the issue on the website. This seems to be an overall adguard issue because it seems that when the annoyance filters are toggled off, they aren't actually off until you turn off the rest of the adguard toggles. Another solution could be just fixing the error in one of the annoyance filters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1877964477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-05T00:52:00Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Problem ONLY occurs when AdGuard Enabled.\r\n> \r\n> I wanted to view census records on FamiilySearch.org (free site). When AdGuard first gave me the error message, I disabled AdGuard from within my browser for that specific site. Ctrl-F5 failed to give me the page. I then disabled the AdGuard for Windows, and Ctrl-F5 was fine. I then re-enabled thinking it was just a glitch. I eventually came to a page I needed to refresh, and the problem resumed. I then tried to report the error because I've had this problem intermittently for a while. And I got the exact same error message. I disabled AdGuard for Windows and then I was able to send this message.\r\n> \r\nUsername: `@digging4roots`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oshpd219mu8k0gk80wsoggg4s4s8gg4h7d1k5sx8xs.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/p57bvucxg004c4400wk84gs840c8ggsw2lxexv952s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.2.241\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter\r\nOther extensions used: | AVD, Dashlane, Google translate, PDF & Print Friendly, Group Speed Dial, FVD Synchronizer, Force paste","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169711/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1878526789","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169711#issuecomment-1878526789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169711","id":1878526789,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85v-AtF","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-05T11:33:01Z","updated_at":"2024-01-05T11:33:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It doesn't look like filters issue.\r\nI'm not sure but it might be related to this problem - https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/4982\r\nPlease contact technical support - support@adguard.com","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1878526789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-05T11:33:03Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Problem ONLY occurs when AdGuard Enabled.\r\n> \r\n> I wanted to view census records on FamiilySearch.org (free site). When AdGuard first gave me the error message, I disabled AdGuard from within my browser for that specific site. Ctrl-F5 failed to give me the page. I then disabled the AdGuard for Windows, and Ctrl-F5 was fine. I then re-enabled thinking it was just a glitch. I eventually came to a page I needed to refresh, and the problem resumed. I then tried to report the error because I've had this problem intermittently for a while. And I got the exact same error message. I disabled AdGuard for Windows and then I was able to send this message.\r\n> \r\nUsername: `@digging4roots`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oshpd219mu8k0gk80wsoggg4s4s8gg4h7d1k5sx8xs.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/p57bvucxg004c4400wk84gs840c8ggsw2lxexv952s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.2.241\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter\r\nOther extensions used: | AVD, Dashlane, Google translate, PDF & Print Friendly, Group Speed Dial, FVD Synchronizer, Force paste","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169711/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-05T11:33:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
