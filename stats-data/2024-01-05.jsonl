Yes, you do have to finish a race before going to the home page.

The bigger problem here is that I do not have the annoyance filters activated. What I discovered is that when I turn on the annoyance filter (the overall toggle), it breaks the website in question. But, when I turn off and on all of the filters (not including the annoyance filter), it fixes the issue on the website. This seems to be an overall adguard issue because it seems that when the annoyance filters are toggled off, they aren't actually off until you turn off the rest of the adguard toggles. Another solution could be just fixing the error in one of the annoyance filters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1877964477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-05T00:52:00Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
