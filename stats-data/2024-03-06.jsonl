현재 iOS에서 List-KR을 AdGuard 베이스 필터, AdGuard 기타 방해 요소 필터와 함께 사용하면 파워링크가 노출됩니다. List-KR을 단독으로 사용하거나 List-KR, AdGuard 베이스 필터만 사용하거나 List-KR, AdGuard 기타 방해 요소 필터만 사용하는 경우에는 정상적으로 차단합니다. 세 필터를 모두 사용하는 경우에만 파워링크를 차단하지 못하는 현상이 나타납니다. 필터 버전은 모두 최신 버전입니다.\r\n\r\n며칠 전부터 계속 파워링크 차단이 됐다가 안 됐다가 오락가락합니다. 오늘 또다시 차단이 안 되길래 제보했는데 AdGuard 베이스 필터 2.3.25.44 버전으로 업데이트 이후 고쳐졌습니다.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1980370515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-06T08:52:15Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
