현재 iOS에서 List-KR을 AdGuard 베이스 필터, AdGuard 기타 방해 요소 필터와 함께 사용하면 파워링크가 노출됩니다. List-KR을 단독으로 사용하거나 List-KR, AdGuard 베이스 필터만 사용하거나 List-KR, AdGuard 기타 방해 요소 필터만 사용하는 경우에는 정상적으로 차단합니다. 세 필터를 모두 사용하는 경우에만 파워링크를 차단하지 못하는 현상이 나타납니다. 필터 버전은 모두 최신 버전입니다.\r\n\r\n며칠 전부터 계속 파워링크 차단이 됐다가 안 됐다가 오락가락합니다. 오늘 또다시 차단이 안 되길래 제보했는데 AdGuard 베이스 필터 2.3.25.44 버전으로 업데이트 이후 고쳐졌습니다.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1980370515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-06T08:52:15Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

AdGuard 베이스 필터 2.3.25.46인데 잘 동작합니다. 나중에 버그가 발생하면 알려주시겠어요? AdGuard for iOS 버그에 가까워 보입니다.\r\n\r\n지금 파워링크 나옵니다. 필터는 모두 최신 버전으로 업데이트한 상태입니다. 참고로 필터를 업데이트하거나 껐다 켜도 iOS 사파리에서는 바로 반영되지가 않고 3회 새로고침을 해줘야 최종 설정이 똑바로 적용되더군요. 이번에도 필터 업데이트하고 사파리에서 3회 새로고침 했더니 파워링크가 다시 나오네요.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1980657451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-06T11:24:57Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

They can be found by:\r\n`document.cookie =`\r\nThey must be replaced by `set-cookie` / `set-cookie-reload` / `trusted-set-cookie-reload` scriptlet rules.\r\n\r\nThere are many old rules, so first you need to check if the site is available, and then the need for the rule.\r\n\r\n* For convenience, you can work in a separate browser\r\n* Retrieve the list of domains, clean up duplicates and check if sites exist (if redirects occur, we assume that the site is dead).\r\n* All such rules can be merged into one file, convert them to exception rules and import as custom filter. Then go down the list and check if the rules are needed (other types of problems not related to these rules are skipped).\r\n* If the site is dead - add domains in the comment below. Then we will remove them from the filters.\r\n\r\nIn order not to overlap with other filter maintainers, it is desirable to perform batch rule replacement via pull-requests (5-10 rules per PR).\r\n\r\n### Important\r\nIt should be checked with a Dutch or German VPN, because otherwise the cookie usage messages may not appear.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1980871600","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756#issuecomment-1980871600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756","id":1980871600,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM852EbOw","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-06T13:26:55Z","updated_at":"2024-03-06T13:26:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Dead domain: `megalyrics.ru`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1980871600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-06T13:26:56Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
