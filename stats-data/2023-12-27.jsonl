Comment\r\n> When I search for something, let's say beds, I see Google ads on the top of my page and that's perfectly fine. I want to see the ads on the top of my search results, but I don't want to see the additional ads once I go to a page. However, I can't go to a page because all pages are blocked. Which filter I have to turn of to have all ads block everywhere but not Google ads?\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot

Comment\r\n> When I search for something, let's say beds, I see Google ads on the top of my page and that's perfectly fine. I want to see the ads on the top of my search results, but I don't want to see the additional ads once I go to a page. However, I can't go to a page because all pages are blocked. Which filter I have to turn of to have all ads block everywhere but not Google ads?\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/661ojckhyxc8wkwsgccc8s80400gcooq2ztpaedaw0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hvfy8y6mct4cscg0c8wgc80c0kg000cmbt8zd3mcis.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v1.11.16\r\nSystem version: | iOS 17\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-27T06:30:33Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

unlocked when AdGuard is enabled ; the countdown for unlocking items is displayed instead of the advertising video because it's blocked by AdGuard.\r\n> \r\n> But when the countdown is over, it starts over and over again :-(\r\n> \r\n> I also update the ad filters without effect...\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Do you have any idea what's going on please ?\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Thank you in advance for your

已经尝试过以下方法：\r\n> 1. 重置Adguard设置，完全重装Adguard。\r\n> 2. 清空Safari浏览器缓存和Mac网络缓存\r\n> 3. 关闭Adgurad尝试了其他过滤插件，其他插件能在www.zhihu.com上正常运行。\r\n> 推测：某一次关闭了adguard之后，再次打开时，设置未能生效。我想知道，adguard是否在PC的其他位置中缓存了配置文件。\r\nUsername: `@MrStrangerYang`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot

`capital.it#@##iubenda-cs-banner`: if you don't reject cookies you can't listen to the webradio, so you can't hide it;\r\n\r\n- Added `deejay.it` and `capital.it` to the existing (trusted-) scriptlets to automatically reject cookies;\r\n- Removed `capital.it` from `#%#//scriptlet('trusted-click-element', '.iubenda-cs-visible .iubenda-cs-accept-btn')`: you don't need to accept cookies, you can reject them;\r\n\r\n- Replaced `capital.it#%#//scriptlet('prevent-element-src-loading', 'script', 'static.chartbeat.com/js/chartbeat_brightcove_plugin.js')` with `redirect=noopjs` so uBO users can take advantage of it;\r\n- Added `googletagmanager.com/gtm.js` exception needed to listen to the webradio.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not

fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [ ] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [x] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters

`capital.it#@##iubenda-cs-banner`: if you don't reject cookies you can't listen to the webradio, so you can't hide it;\r\n\r\n- Added `deejay.it` and `capital.it` to the existing (trusted-) scriptlets to automatically reject cookies;\r\n- Removed `capital.it` from `#%#//scriptlet('trusted-click-element', '.iubenda-cs-visible .iubenda-cs-accept-btn')`: you don't need to accept cookies, you can reject them;\r\n\r\n- Replaced `capital.it#%#//scriptlet('prevent-element-src-loading', 'script', 'static.chartbeat.com/js/chartbeat_brightcove_plugin.js')` with `redirect=noopjs` so uBO users can take advantage of it;\r\n- Added `googletagmanager.com/gtm.js` exception needed to listen to the webradio.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not

[guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [ ] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [x] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\n\r\nfix https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/168620\r\nfix https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/168622\r\nupdate

`capital.it#@##iubenda-cs-banner`: if you don't reject cookies you can't listen to the webradio, so you can't hide it;\r\n\r\n- Added `deejay.it` and `capital.it` to the existing (trusted-) scriptlets to automatically reject cookies;\r\n- Removed `capital.it` from `#%#//scriptlet('trusted-click-element', '.iubenda-cs-visible .iubenda-cs-accept-btn')`: you don't need to accept cookies, you can reject them;\r\n\r\n- Replaced `capital.it#%#//scriptlet('prevent-element-src-loading', 'script', 'static.chartbeat.com/js/chartbeat_brightcove_plugin.js')` with `redirect=noopjs` so uBO users can take advantage of it;\r\n- Added `googletagmanager.com/gtm.js` exception needed to listen to the webradio.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not

`capital.it#@##iubenda-cs-banner`: if you don't reject cookies you can't listen to the webradio, so you can't hide it;\r\n\r\n- Added `deejay.it` and `capital.it` to the existing (trusted-) scriptlets to automatically reject cookies;\r\n- Removed `capital.it` from `#%#//scriptlet('trusted-click-element', '.iubenda-cs-visible .iubenda-cs-accept-btn')`: you don't need to accept cookies, you can reject them;\r\n\r\n- Replaced `capital.it#%#//scriptlet('prevent-element-src-loading', 'script', 'static.chartbeat.com/js/chartbeat_brightcove_plugin.js')` with `redirect=noopjs` so uBO users can take advantage of it;\r\n- Added `googletagmanager.com/gtm.js` exception needed to listen to the webradio.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not
