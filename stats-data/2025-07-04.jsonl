Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://music.youtube.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.youtube.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen I enable AdGuard while using YouTube Music, it causes several issues:\r\n- The music stops playing when the browser tab is not active.\r\n- The \"Next\" and \"Previous\" buttons are removed.\r\n- The song title is removed.\r\n- In the song view, the list of upcoming songs is blocked.\r\n\r\nWhen I turn off AdGuard, YouTube Music works normally.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n1. Open YouTube Music.\r\n2. Enable AdGuard.\r\n3. Start playing a song.\r\n4. Switch to a different browser tab or observe the interface.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nYouTube Music should work normally with AdGuard enabled: \r\n- Music should continue playing in the background when the tab is inactive.\r\n- Buttons like \"Next\" and \"Previous\" should remain visible.\r\n- Song title and list of next songs should be displayed.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nWith AdGuard enabled, YouTube Music has broken functionality as described above.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n- Browser: [your browser, e.g., Chrome/Firefox + version]\r\n- AdGuard version: [your AdGuard extension version]\r\n- OS: [your operating system, e.g., Windows 11/macOS 14]\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional: Add your GitHub username here if you want to be mentioned -->\r\n**GitHub username**: [your username]\r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\nUsername: @https://github.com/heorhii-lytvynenko\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/cmhp02a5nmogg8wg4gwcg84s8gcw0kwf1yc49lfe54.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/aevw2djcwrcc4o8o4g40kg4og44o4s057pptfrewj8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.102 MV2\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 11`\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection: | \r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Ukrainian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `chrome remote desktop, react developer tools, redux devtools, side view`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208562/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3036011846","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208562#issuecomment-3036011846","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208562","id":3036011846,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM8609d1G","user":{"login":"heorhii-lytvynenko","id":104064704,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjPmwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104064704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heorhii-lytvynenko","html_url":"https://github.com/heorhii-lytvynenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heorhii-lytvynenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heorhii-lytvynenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heorhii-lytvynenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heorhii-lytvynenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heorhii-lytvynenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heorhii-lytvynenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heorhii-lytvynenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heorhii-lytvynenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heorhii-lytvynenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-04T12:22:13Z","updated_at":"2025-07-04T12:22:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Dear AdGuard team, I‚Äôm sorry for the interruption.

contain Chinese characters.\r\n> \r\n> For example, try searching for **\"‰º∫ÊúçÂô® ithome\"** on `www.google.com`.  \r\n> When opening the ithome website from the search results, the address cannot be entered properly.\r\n> \r\n> **Example URL:**\r\n> - [https://www.google.com/search?q=‰º∫ÊúçÂô®+ithome&newwindow=1](https://www.google.com/search?q=‰º∫ÊúçÂô®+ithome&newwindow=1)\r\n> -

Comment\r\n> AdGuard is unable to correctly handle Percent-Encoding (e.g., `%=` = `%25`, `&` = `%26`) under certain circumstances.  \r\n> This issue arises when processing specific URLs or URLs that contain Chinese characters.\r\n> \r\n> For example, try searching for **\"‰º∫ÊúçÂô® ithome\"** on `www.google.com`.  \r\n> When opening the ithome website from the search results, the address cannot be entered properly.\r\n> \r\n> **Example URL:**\r\n> - [https://www.google.com/search?q=‰º∫ÊúçÂô®+ithome&newwindow=1](https://www.google.com/search?q=‰º∫ÊúçÂô®+ithome&newwindow=1)\r\n> -

`www.google.com` via the **AdGuard browser extension** on **MS Edge**, the issue can be quickly resolved.  \r\n> However, since I am using **AdGuard for Windows**, the problem may be related to

Comment\r\n> AdGuard is unable to correctly handle Percent-Encoding (e.g., `%=` = `%25`, `&` = `%26`) under certain circumstances.  \r\n> This issue arises when processing specific URLs or URLs that contain Chinese characters.\r\n> \r\n> For example, try searching for **\"‰º∫ÊúçÂô® ithome\"** on `www.google.com`.  \r\n> When opening the ithome website from the search results, the address cannot be entered properly.\r\n> \r\n> **Example URL:**\r\n> - [https://www.google.com/search?q=‰º∫ÊúçÂô®+ithome&newwindow=1](https://www.google.com/search?q=‰º∫ÊúçÂô®+ithome&newwindow=1)\r\n> -

`www.google.com` via the **AdGuard browser extension** on **MS Edge**, the issue can be quickly resolved.  \r\n> However, since I am using **AdGuard for Windows**, the problem may be related to features such as traffic filtering or HTTPS filtering.\r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript.

Comment\r\n> AdGuard is unable to correctly handle Percent-Encoding (e.g., `%=` = `%25`, `&` = `%26`) under certain circumstances.  \r\n> This issue arises when processing specific URLs or URLs that contain Chinese characters.\r\n> \r\n> For example, try searching for **\"‰º∫ÊúçÂô® ithome\"** on `www.google.com`.  \r\n> When opening the ithome website from the search results, the address cannot be entered properly.\r\n> \r\n> **Example URL:**\r\n> - [https://www.google.com/search?q=‰º∫ÊúçÂô®+ithome&newwindow=1](https://www.google.com/search?q=‰º∫ÊúçÂô®+ithome&newwindow=1)\r\n> -

`www.google.com` via the **AdGuard browser extension** on **MS Edge**, the issue can be quickly resolved.  \r\n> However, since I am using **AdGuard for Windows**, the problem may be related to features such as traffic filtering or HTTPS filtering.\r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
