Comment\r\n> I use the app “Downie” https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/ to download audio, video, and images from various websites.   One such was of starting a download is to paste the URL of a page that contains the item you want to download.   \r\n> \r\n> This works 100% of the time for everything EXCEPT Twitter.   Excuse me, X.com.   \r\n> \r\n> So say I want to download this gif of a tornado that I just tweeted.  The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.   Disable it and you can now use either x.com or twitter.com URLs.\r\n> \r\n> A while back I THOUGHT i had nailed this down as being related to DNS Protection, which i had  been using at the time.  Seems like when I changed it or disabled it the problem went away, however that is not the case as of now.   So the only workaround is to change the URL manually.\r\nUsername: `@petekjohnson`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2hn926dr1ym8ssscccswg0osw4g4ccge5e4zuoc6nw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3avlpgf7gpmookk8wwok00go80g0k0or8jv4569tsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4inmkqoses6cwck00k0g4kggk084w4scuu435qluj4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/k5j80az0yyo00ggogs4gs0c0ccgs8kkplp9qmb41k0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/olobxet5y68wskgs4cgks00wc0cg04gtbazl40rees.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/dy5dcp60nvkgg4c0so84gws4sk4soocl2sdssp4tf4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.14.0.1599 nightly\r\nSystem version: | macOS 14.5 Beta (23F5074a)\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode options: | Block Java, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your IP address (208.54.104.184), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Downie Safari Extension, AdGuard Assistant","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2118620515","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862#issuecomment-2118620515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862","id":2118620515,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85-R5Vj","user":{"login":"Yuki2718","id":58900598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTAwNTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58900598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718","html_url":"https://github.com/Yuki2718","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-18T03:28:06Z","updated_at":"2024-05-18T03:28:06Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/commit/d29352aeecb4bafbc048414c31678f63494f4e92 is a bad rule, hiding the bottom bar on mobile UA.

Comment\r\n> I use the app “Downie” https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/ to download audio, video, and images from various websites.   One such was of starting a download is to paste the URL of a page that contains the item you want to download.   \r\n> \r\n> This works 100% of the time for everything EXCEPT Twitter.   Excuse me, X.com.   \r\n> \r\n> So say I want to download this gif of a tornado that I just tweeted.  The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.   Disable it and you can now use either x.com or twitter.com URLs.\r\n> \r\n> A while back I THOUGHT i had nailed this down as being related to DNS Protection, which i had  been using at the time.

Comment\r\n> I use the app “Downie” https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/ to download audio, video, and images from various websites.   One such was of starting a download is to paste the URL of a page that contains the item you want to download.   \r\n> \r\n> This works 100% of the time for everything EXCEPT Twitter.   Excuse me, X.com.   \r\n> \r\n> So say I want to download this gif of a tornado that I just tweeted.  The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.

Comment\r\n> I use the app “Downie” https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/ to download audio, video, and images from various websites.   One such was of starting a download is to paste the URL of a page that contains the item you want to download.   \r\n> \r\n> This works 100% of the time for everything EXCEPT Twitter.   Excuse me, X.com.   \r\n> \r\n> So say I want to download this gif of a tornado that I just tweeted.  The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.   Disable it and you can now use either x.com or twitter.com URLs.\r\n> \r\n> A while back I THOUGHT i had nailed this down as being related to DNS Protection, which i had  been using at the time.  Seems like when I changed it or disabled it the problem went away, however that is not the case as of now.   So the only workaround is to change the URL manually.\r\nUsername: `@petekjohnson`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2hn926dr1ym8ssscccswg0osw4g4ccge5e4zuoc6nw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3avlpgf7gpmookk8wwok00go80g0k0or8jv4569tsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4inmkqoses6cwck00k0g4kggk084w4scuu435qluj4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/k5j80az0yyo00ggogs4gs0c0ccgs8kkplp9qmb41k0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/olobxet5y68wskgs4cgks00wc0cg04gtbazl40rees.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/dy5dcp60nvkgg4c0so84gws4sk4soocl2sdssp4tf4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.14.0.1599 nightly\r\nSystem version: | macOS 14.5 Beta (23F5074a)\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode options: | Block Java, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your IP address (208.54.104.184), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Downie Safari Extension, AdGuard Assistant","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2118690589","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862#issuecomment-2118690589","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862","id":2118690589,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85-SKcd","user":{"login":"FadeMind","id":9846948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NDY5NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9846948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FadeMind","html_url":"https://github.com/FadeMind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FadeMind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FadeMind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FadeMind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FadeMind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FadeMind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FadeMind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FadeMind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FadeMind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FadeMind/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-18T08:18:56Z","updated_at":"2024-05-18T08:18:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"CC @BlazDT cookies","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2118690589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-18T08:18:57Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2FPETEandrepete_%2Fstatus%2F1788379241815445981)\r\n### Comment\r\n> I use the app “Downie” https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/ to download audio, video, and images from various websites.   One such was of starting a download is to paste the URL of a page that contains the item you want to download.   \r\n> \r\n> This works 100% of the time for everything EXCEPT Twitter.   Excuse me, X.com.   \r\n> \r\n> So say I want to download this gif of a tornado that I just tweeted.  The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.   Disable it and you can now use either x.com or twitter.com URLs.\r\n> \r\n> A while back I THOUGHT i had nailed this down as being related to DNS Protection, which i had  been using at the time.  Seems like when I changed it or disabled it the problem went away, however that is not the case as of now.   So the only workaround is to change the URL manually.\r\nUsername: `@petekjohnson`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2hn926dr1ym8ssscccswg0osw4g4ccge5e4zuoc6nw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3avlpgf7gpmookk8wwok00go80g0k0or8jv4569tsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4inmkqoses6cwck00k0g4kggk084w4scuu435qluj4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/k5j80az0yyo00ggogs4gs0c0ccgs8kkplp9qmb41k0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/olobxet5y68wskgs4cgks00wc0cg04gtbazl40rees.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/dy5dcp60nvkgg4c0so84gws4sk4soocl2sdssp4tf4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.14.0.1599 nightly\r\nSystem version: | macOS 14.5 Beta (23F5074a)\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode options: | Block Java, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your IP address (208.54.104.184), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Downie Safari Extension, AdGuard Assistant","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2118690302","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862#issuecomment-2118690302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862","id":2118690302,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85-SKX-","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-18T08:17:57Z","updated_at":"2024-05-18T08:17:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Annoyance)\r\n [https://x.com/home](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2Fhome)\r\nUsername: `@FadeMind`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/41b0zuidb4yso8gcosk0cw0k4c8w04waa58hnnbacg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.46\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish GDPR-Cookies Filters, <br/>KAD -

The rule here was added to uAssets by https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/commit/9597e167987c094f814e236c62a3968af8d2871f and subsequently adjusted by https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/commit/783d732c84557ca42a8492c3f01be3e172acd5d8 , no problem has been reported. We already have a specific rule for CB added by https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pull/157595 but this can be generic if `{n,m}` is supported.\r\n\r\n2.

Comment\r\n> Много лет всё работало отлично, но вчера (17.05.2024) на сайте hdrezka.ag при просмотре фильма, который нормально смотрел позавчера (16.05.2024) появилось неадекватное количество рекламы. Функция \"блокировать рекламу на сайте\" и ручная блокировка элементов помогает до первого обновления страницы. Сайт не находится в \"исключениях\".  Возможно, это произошло после отключения на один вечер в трее приложения на Windows (в целях экономии батареи на ноутбуке) (но браузерная версия не была отключена). На других сайтах всё работает в штатном режиме. Переустановка приложения и расширения с перезагрузками не дало нужного эффекта.\r\nUsername: `@KotWRF`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tv79p70jx0gk88s4sggwsskkwgwcgk02cai70aoso4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v19045.4412\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 Домашняя, 19045.4412\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | TDI\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | только adguard приложение на виндовс 10 и браузерное расширение в хроме\r\n\r\n### Import issue configuration (AdGuard for Windows)\r\n[Import](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=adguard%3Aimport_user_configuration%3F)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2118850777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-18T15:03:17Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> I use the app “Downie” https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/ to download audio, video, and images from various websites.   One such was of starting a download is to paste the URL of a page that contains the item you want to download.   \r\n> \r\n> This works 100% of the time for everything EXCEPT Twitter.   Excuse me, X.com.   \r\n> \r\n> So say I want to download this gif of a tornado that I just tweeted.  The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.   Disable it and you can now use either x.com or twitter.com URLs.\r\n> \r\n> A while back I THOUGHT i had nailed this down as being related to DNS Protection, which i had  been using at the time.  Seems like when I changed it or disabled it the problem went away, however that is not the case as of now.   So the only workaround is to change the URL manually.\r\nUsername: `@petekjohnson`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Comment\r\n> I use the app “Downie” https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/ to download audio, video, and images from various websites.   One such was of starting a download is to paste the URL of a page that contains the item you want to download.   \r\n> \r\n> This works 100% of the time for everything EXCEPT Twitter.   Excuse me, X.com.   \r\n> \r\n> So say I want to download this gif of a tornado that I just tweeted.  The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.   Disable it and you can now use either x.com or twitter.com URLs.\r\n> \r\n> A while back I THOUGHT i had nailed this down as being related to DNS Protection, which i had  been using at the time.  Seems like when I changed it or disabled it the problem went away, however that is not the case as of now.   So the only workaround is to change the URL manually.\r\nUsername: `@petekjohnson`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2hn926dr1ym8ssscccswg0osw4g4ccge5e4zuoc6nw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3avlpgf7gpmookk8wwok00go80g0k0or8jv4569tsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4inmkqoses6cwck00k0g4kggk084w4scuu435qluj4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/k5j80az0yyo00ggogs4gs0c0ccgs8kkplp9qmb41k0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/olobxet5y68wskgs4cgks00wc0cg04gtbazl40rees.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/dy5dcp60nvkgg4c0so84gws4sk4soocl2sdssp4tf4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.14.0.1599 nightly\r\nSystem version: | macOS 14.5 Beta (23F5074a)\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode options: | Block Java, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your IP address (208.54.104.184), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Downie Safari Extension, AdGuard Assistant","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-18T20:19:11Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
