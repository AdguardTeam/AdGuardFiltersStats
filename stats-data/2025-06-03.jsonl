Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nThough it's been some years now since I last proposed the idea (#89227), I figured it was worth revisiting, in part as it'd make it somewhat viable for uBO to add `az` to their list of ISO codes that have regional lists auto-assigned to new extension installations by default.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nMove the following 409 entries from https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/BaseFilter/sections/foreign.txt to various subfolders in
