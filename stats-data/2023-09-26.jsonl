@Jamyn\r\n> Within AdGuard Home, the \"Phishing URL Blocklist (PhishTank and OpenPhish)\" blocks s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.

@Jamyn\r\n> Within AdGuard Home, the \"Phishing URL Blocklist (PhishTank and OpenPhish)\" blocks s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. Steam (a gaming platform) uses the subdomain steamcloud-us-east.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com to save game state, so blocking this URL means some game saves can \"randomly\" fail if Steam selects the us-east region for the save.  Users will see a generic \"cloud sync error\" in the Steam client.\r\n> \r\n> This overly-broad block breaks the Steam client's ability to save game data.
