Comment\r\n> The problem is that the Angry Birds 2 game will not work unless fundingchoicesmessages.google.com is unblocked or adguard is disabled. When unblocked, the game will load normally with ads however they are usually broken but there are still some full felged ads that will appear with the video playing unable to exit out.\r\n> \r\n> How to reproduce:\r\n> 1) Have angry birds 2 installed with adguard loaded with default filters/or any other.\r\n> 2) Load the game without unblocking fundingchoicesmessages.google.com.\r\n> 3) Wait for it to load the game and an error message will pop up saying there is no connection.\r\nUsername: `@grandstrand`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n

Comment\r\n> The problem is that the Angry Birds 2 game will not work unless fundingchoicesmessages.google.com is unblocked or adguard is disabled. When unblocked, the game will load normally with ads however they are usually broken but there are still some full felged ads that will appear with the video playing unable to exit out.\r\n> \r\n> How to reproduce:\r\n> 1) Have angry birds 2 installed with adguard loaded with default filters/or any other.\r\n> 2) Load the game without unblocking fundingchoicesmessages.google.com.\r\n> 3) Wait for it to load the game and an error message will pop up saying there is no connection.\r\nUsername: `@grandstrand`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/nf9fud86nb40w8wwckk8g4sokogksow83gliqf9zik.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/o529o1mcn1w8kw0og8s4w04ks4ws0k4lyl11wbv800.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2mg7xz4sx70g4480os4ocwk8s0kkcwgmvst7tg8xdw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8tcu1lz03yg4c800w44c4s4kcgcg8kggdf6uc52o34.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/68jv1gk0864gksgwskgk8okwgs44gokhis6e7w48rk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.5.17\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://d.adguard-dns.com/dns-query/xxxxxxx`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://duckduckgo.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fduckduckgo.com%2F)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183564/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-23T11:08:35Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> The problem is that the Angry Birds 2 game will not work unless fundingchoicesmessages.google.com is unblocked or adguard is disabled. When unblocked, the game will load normally with ads however they are usually broken but there are still some full felged ads that will appear with the video playing unable to exit out.\r\n> \r\n> How to reproduce:\r\n> 1) Have angry birds 2 installed with adguard loaded with default filters/or any other.\r\n> 2) Load the game without unblocking fundingchoicesmessages.google.com.\r\n> 3) Wait for it to load the game and an error message will pop up saying there is no connection.\r\nUsername: `@grandstrand`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n

Comment\r\n> The problem is that the Angry Birds 2 game will not work unless fundingchoicesmessages.google.com is unblocked or adguard is disabled. When unblocked, the game will load normally with ads however they are usually broken but there are still some full felged ads that will appear with the video playing unable to exit out.\r\n> \r\n> How to reproduce:\r\n> 1) Have angry birds 2 installed with adguard loaded with default filters/or any other.\r\n> 2) Load the game without unblocking fundingchoicesmessages.google.com.\r\n> 3) Wait for it to load the game and an error message will pop up saying there is no connection.\r\nUsername: `@grandstrand`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/nf9fud86nb40w8wwckk8g4sokogksow83gliqf9zik.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/o529o1mcn1w8kw0og8s4w04ks4ws0k4lyl11wbv800.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2mg7xz4sx70g4480os4ocwk8s0kkcwgmvst7tg8xdw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8tcu1lz03yg4c800w44c4s4kcgcg8kggdf6uc52o34.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/68jv1gk0864gksgwskgk8okwgs44gokhis6e7w48rk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.5.17\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://d.adguard-dns.com/dns-query/xxxxxxx`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://duckduckgo.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fduckduckgo.com%2F)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183564/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-23T11:36:06Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
