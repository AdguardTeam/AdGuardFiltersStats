I try to click on the adblocker sign to disable it, but as I move my curser away the choice to disable the blocker disapears.  The page continues to glitch for about 20 seconds until the 500 error code comes up.  By this point the adblocker has turned itself off, however the page will not reload until I manually turn it back on then off again.  I have had adguard for a few years on a different laptop (Apple) and this has never happened before.  I have had this macbook (apple) for a month now and have only just run into the problem. \r\nUsername: `@nicolabeattie`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/437gzbz3seqss4ocks0ww88so040swk3yb1up21czs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qh9dj0tas9c8s48kkg8ss8og8c8coooa0wxzpit21c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/gvhupvl2l1s84gcos408gw84ckcok087ham95y8430.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qvoqdx3kci8cggggowk4gwocwg4880cbexlcvlhcvw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.2.241\r\nSystem version: | Mac OS 13.5.0\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nOther extensions used: | trend micro, stacker, momentum ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170837/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-16T04:25:10Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

when trying to load Outlook, the page glitches, flashing the adblocker logo.  I try to click on the adblocker sign to disable it, but as I move my curser away the choice to disable the blocker disapears.  The page continues to glitch for about 20 seconds until the 500 error code comes up.  By this point the adblocker has turned itself off, however the page will not reload until I manually turn it back on then off again.  I have had adguard for a few years on a different laptop (Apple) and this has never happened before.  I have had this macbook (apple) for a month now and have only just run into the problem. \r\nUsername: `@nicolabeattie`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/437gzbz3seqss4ocks0ww88so040swk3yb1up21czs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qh9dj0tas9c8s48kkg8ss8og8c8coooa0wxzpit21c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/gvhupvl2l1s84gcos408gw84ckcok087ham95y8430.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qvoqdx3kci8cggggowk4gwocwg4880cbexlcvlhcvw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.2.241\r\nSystem version: | Mac OS 13.5.0\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nOther extensions used: | trend micro, stacker, momentum ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170837/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1893475716","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170837#issuecomment-1893475716","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170837","id":1893475716,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85w3CWE","user":{"login":"jellizaveta","id":91964807,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXtFhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91964807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta","html_url":"https://github.com/jellizaveta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-16T10:34:29Z","updated_at":"2024-01-16T10:34:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nicolabeattie Hello?
