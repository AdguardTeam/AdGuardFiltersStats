Hello. I am Sergey Tkachenko, the owner of the winaero.com website. Some time ago a reader reported me an issue that with AdGuard, they have an empty sidebar on the website. The issue has been resolved by a filter update, but now this happens again. The most recent filter update removes almost everything from the sidebar, including the \"Connect with us\" section with static links to the social media my website is represented on, e-mail subscription, and RSS. I am sure that this block wasn't supposed to be removed, and wasn't removed by bad faith. There must be some unintentional bug in the filter. Could you please correct the filter and restore the block? It didn't annoy anyone a once.\r\n\r\n3.

Hello. I am Sergey Tkachenko, the owner of the winaero.com website. Some time ago a reader reported me an issue that with AdGuard, they have an empty sidebar on the website. The issue has been resolved by a filter update, but now this happens again. The most recent filter update removes almost everything from the sidebar, including the \"Connect with us\" section with static links to the social media my website is represented on, e-mail subscription, and RSS. I am sure that this block wasn't supposed to be removed, and wasn't removed by bad faith. There must be some unintentional bug in the filter. Could you please correct the filter and restore the block? It didn't annoy anyone a once.\r\n\r\n3.

Hello. I am Sergey Tkachenko, the owner of the winaero.com website. Some time ago a reader reported me an issue that with AdGuard, they have an empty sidebar on the website. The issue has been resolved by a filter update, but now this happens again. The most recent filter update removes almost everything from the sidebar, including the \"Connect with us\" section with static links to the social media my website is represented on, e-mail subscription, and RSS. I am sure that this block wasn't supposed to be removed, and wasn't removed by bad faith. There must be some unintentional bug in the filter. Could you please correct the filter and restore the block? It didn't annoy anyone a once.\r\n\r\n3.

Hello. I am Sergey Tkachenko, the owner of the winaero.com website. Some time ago a reader reported me an issue that with AdGuard, they have an empty sidebar on the website. The issue has been resolved by a filter update, but now this happens again. The most recent filter update removes almost everything from the sidebar, including the \"Connect with us\" section with static links to the social media my website is represented on, e-mail subscription, and RSS. I am sure that this block wasn't supposed to be removed, and wasn't removed by bad faith. There must be some unintentional bug in the filter. Could you please correct the filter and restore the block? It didn't annoy anyone a once.\r\n\r\n3.
