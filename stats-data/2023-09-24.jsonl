Comment\r\n> The AdGuard URL Tracking Protection filter prevents DuckDuckGo from working normally. I have individually checked every other filter I have and this is the one - and only one - that breaks DuckDuckGo. Specifically, the \"?q=\" in the query string in the URL after a search is entered is the breaking string. Removing that string manually allows the web page to work. Changing settings within DuckDuckGo (safe search, time filters, etc.) seems to not have any impact.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2zh31kdtjneow00og08g4wcsg08c0o04tj969yumuw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/p47qc4ezf2o8c4ogwkkkgw0gkg4wgco42zetkhfabc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/7e9m5mna1dogcogk888ck4o4ssos8wka4dybh5c4l4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Ublock Origin\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nFilters: | <b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking\r\nOther extensions used: | Ublock Origin, DuckDuckGo, Privacy Badger, Disconnect, Bitdefender Free","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1732441101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-24T00:24:38Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
