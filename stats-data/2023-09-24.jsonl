Comment\r\n> The AdGuard URL Tracking Protection filter prevents DuckDuckGo from working normally. I have individually checked every other filter I have and this is the one - and only one - that breaks DuckDuckGo. Specifically, the \"?q=\" in the query string in the URL after a search is entered is the breaking string. Removing that string manually allows the web page to work. Changing settings within DuckDuckGo (safe search, time filters, etc.) seems to not have any impact.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2zh31kdtjneow00og08g4wcsg08c0o04tj969yumuw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/p47qc4ezf2o8c4ogwkkkgw0gkg4wgco42zetkhfabc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/7e9m5mna1dogcogk888ck4o4ssos8wka4dybh5c4l4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Ublock Origin\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nFilters: | <b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking\r\nOther extensions used: | Ublock Origin, DuckDuckGo, Privacy Badger, Disconnect, Bitdefender Free","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1732441101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-24T00:24:38Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Пару дней назад на телефоне интернет стал не интернет при включенном блокировщике. Например, приложение самокат не загружается вовсе. Браузеры работают очень медленно и не програжают страницы полностью. Даже чтобы написать этот баг-репорт пришлось отключит защиту. Для теста я отключал поочередно все фильтры, на текущий момент выключены в настройках все фильтры, но при включении защиты все-равно проблемы. Пробовал и с домашнего wi fi, и с мобильной сетью. Но успеха не добился. Замечу, что в помощнике Adguard при запуске самоката не блокируется ничего. Да и в статистике тоже 0. Можете, пожалуйста, натолкнуть, куда копать.\r\n> Из последних действий - прочитал статью про куки в телеге и включил фильтр уведомлений, но для теста сейчас его также выключил.\r\n> \r\n> Кстати, при автоматическом заполнении данных в баг-репорте версия Android заполнилась \"30\" - обратите внимание.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6fh083w9zowswcssgswokksk4k04sg03jgdh64rhhg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/p1mvlhy22q8csok4g8kscccoco4ok4wmnqlrjdgb68.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 11\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101;4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js,<br>https://greasyfork.org/scripts/11269-no-yandex-ads/code/no-yandex-ads.user.js,<br>https://greasyfork.org/scripts/19993-ru-adlist-js-fixes/code/RU%20AdList%20JS%20Fixes.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162394/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-24T11:08:32Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

comportement est certes novice, cependant des intrusions ne me permettent pas d'actualiser mes mots de passe automatiquement. ces intrusions sont constantes et aucune action judiciaires ne remontent les pervers.  Je ne veux pas me cacher avec des adresses emails codées des identifiants secrets. Je veux pouvoir me connecter en toute tranquillité, et que mes mots de passe complexes soient reinitialisés sans à avoir systématiquement à formater mon systeme.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/39rudgbq4da8wwssoog0cowscoc4o4s3qnv4omygc4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pdf3mfg00nkckg4k00g8wwccocoso088eyo1ljq1h0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.2.168\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard French\r\nOther extensions used: | logiciel de formulation de nouveaux mots de passes inactif, non fonctionnel","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162424/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-24T14:53:30Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
