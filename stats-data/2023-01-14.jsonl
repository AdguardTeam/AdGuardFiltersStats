from Adguard Tracking Protection: `||cdn.stroeerdigitalgroup.de^$third-party` causes an AD placeholder appearing on the main page (screenshoot 1), it can be proven by turning off Adguard Tracking Protection or disabling the filter by `badfilter` (`||cdn.stroeerdigitalgroup.de^$third-party,badfilter`), which fixes the AD placholder (screenshoot 2).
