extension. However, i'm having some issues with Hulu.com.\r\n> \r\n> When enabling the ad guard on Hulu it blocks all of the ads however two things happen:\r\n> \r\n> 1. The ads get embedded into the video. So instead of unskippable ad, it gets embedded in the movie/tvshow and I can skip it by using arrow keys (basically fast forwarding using the movie time controls). If the ad started at 12minutes 10seconds, I just skip 30seconds to go to 12minutes 40seconds. Hope this makes sense. I don't mind doing this but the second issue is why I'm writing this. \r\n> \r\n> 2. The subtitles get out of sync and cannot use the closed captions on Hulu. I think it is because of the hardcoded ads by Hulu when we enable this extension. Is there a way to block the ads but not let Hulu think we've blocked the ads? I'm not technical so I may be grasping at straws here. \r\n> \r\n> Thanks so much. I hope you guys figure this issue out and resolve it whenever's possible. Appreciate you for making such an awesome plugin. \r\n> \r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/oo6Ml5R.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.55\r\nBrowser: | EdgeChromium\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1557113865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-22T12:13:25Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
