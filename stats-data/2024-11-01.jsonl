re-read this thread and saw the query regarding 'upb-notification-bar'.  I had no idea what this was but unchecked my browser extensions to no avail. But on the Amazon sites I do have a **link creator bar** (I'm an Amazon Influencer, so can get links with/without images to paste into my YT videos). \r\n\r\nFrankly, I don't see how an Amazon page toolbar could affect **all** other product pages (not all products are sold by Amazon) unless AZ somehow adds/injects the bar to all product pages I browse... sounds unlikely but as it's controlled by my AZ account, I guess it's possible.\r\n\r\nIt's suddenly all started working but whether the above was the reason or because AdGuardHome has just re-read the custom filters, I do not know. I shall leave it for 24 hours before fiddling / actioning any more changes to the Customs Filter page.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2451936050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-01T14:09:16Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
