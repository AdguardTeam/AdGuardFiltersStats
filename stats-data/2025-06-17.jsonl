las imágenes, y en general en todas las páginas del dominio help.nextdns.io.\r\n> \r\n> Entonces miré que pasaba abriendo el registro de bloqueo y resulta que el filtro de protección contra rastreo modifica unas políticas de permisos de la pagina que se carguen las imágenes.\r\n> \r\n> Use la siguiente regla que me sugería la extensión al hacer clic en desbloquear `@@||help.nextdns.io^$domain=nextdns.io` y a pesar de ello sigue haciendo esas modificaciones en la política de permisos por lo que la única opción es desactivar la extensión para esa página
