las imágenes, y en general en todas las páginas del dominio help.nextdns.io.\r\n> \r\n> Entonces miré que pasaba abriendo el registro de bloqueo y resulta que el filtro de protección contra rastreo modifica unas políticas de permisos de la pagina que se carguen las imágenes.\r\n> \r\n> Use la siguiente regla que me sugería la extensión al hacer clic en desbloquear `@@||help.nextdns.io^$domain=nextdns.io` y a pesar de ello sigue haciendo esas modificaciones en la política de permisos por lo que la única opción es desactivar la extensión para esa página

Comment\r\n> \r\n> ## Issue Report: AdGuard Tracking Protection Rule Causing Endless XHR Retry on Weverse\r\n> \r\n> The following rule from AdGuard Tracking Protection appears to be causing problems:\r\n> \r\n> ```plaintext\r\n> ||nelo2-col.navercorp.com/_store$xhr,domain=weverse.io\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> This rule triggers an issue on a specific Weverse page type called \"Moment.\" Here's an example URL:\r\n> \r\n> : https://weverse.io/fiftyfifty/moment/1da0166977cfeea843f67cc5da5912c2/post/0-152180031\r\n> \r\n> ###  Problem Description\r\n> \r\n> - The blocked XHR request is **retried endlessly**, which causes **high memory usage** until the tab crashes or becomes unresponsive.\r\n> - The issue is consistently reproducible on \"Moment\"-type pages when the rule is active.\r\n> \r\n> ###  Testing Notes\r\n> \r\n> - **New Firefox profile (default settings):** Problem disappears temporarily, then returns after we2_consent cookie being added.\r\n> - **New Firefox profile (restored backup settings):** Does **not trigger** the issue. then returns after we2_consent cookie being added.\r\n> - **Private Browsing Mode (logged in/out):** Does **not trigger** the issue. then returns after we2_consent cookie being added.\r\n> - **Clean Slate (Delete cookies/storage):** Does **not trigger** the issue. then returns after we2_consent cookie being added.\r\n> \r\n> ###  Cookies Triggering the issue:\r\n> - Key: we2_consent\r\n> - Value: {%22agreements%22:[%22ESSENTIAL%22%2C%22ANALYTICAL_PERFORMANCE%22%2C%22FUNCTIONAL_PROFILE%22%2C%22ADVERTISING_TARGETING%22]%2C%22expressed%22:false%2C%22version%22:%221.0.0%22}\r\n> \r\n> ---\r\n> \r\n> Using the following filter rules instead is a working alternative for me, for now:\r\n> \r\n> ```plaintext\r\n> ||nelo2-col.navercorp.com/_store$xhr,domain=weverse.io,badfilter\r\n> weverse.io##+js(no-xhr-if, nelo2-col.navercorp.com)\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
