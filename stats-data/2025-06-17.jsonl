las imágenes, y en general en todas las páginas del dominio help.nextdns.io.\r\n> \r\n> Entonces miré que pasaba abriendo el registro de bloqueo y resulta que el filtro de protección contra rastreo modifica unas políticas de permisos de la pagina que se carguen las imágenes.\r\n> \r\n> Use la siguiente regla que me sugería la extensión al hacer clic en desbloquear `@@||help.nextdns.io^$domain=nextdns.io` y a pesar de ello sigue haciendo esas modificaciones en la política de permisos por lo que la única opción es desactivar la extensión para esa página

Comment\r\n> \r\n> ## Issue Report: AdGuard Tracking Protection Rule Causing Endless XHR Retry on Weverse\r\n> \r\n> The following rule from AdGuard Tracking Protection appears to be causing problems:\r\n> \r\n> ```plaintext\r\n> ||nelo2-col.navercorp.com/_store$xhr,domain=weverse.io\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> This rule triggers an issue on a specific Weverse page type called \"Moment.\" Here's an example URL:\r\n> \r\n> : https://weverse.io/fiftyfifty/moment/1da0166977cfeea843f67cc5da5912c2/post/0-152180031\r\n> \r\n> ###  Problem Description\r\n> \r\n> - The blocked XHR request is **retried endlessly**, which causes **high memory usage** until the tab crashes or becomes unresponsive.\r\n> - The issue is consistently reproducible on \"Moment\"-type pages when the rule is active.\r\n> \r\n> ###  Testing Notes\r\n> \r\n> - **New Firefox profile (default settings):** Problem disappears temporarily, then returns after we2_consent cookie being added.\r\n> - **New Firefox profile (restored backup settings):** Does **not trigger** the issue. then returns after we2_consent cookie being added.\r\n> - **Private Browsing Mode (logged in/out):** Does **not trigger** the issue. then returns after we2_consent cookie being added.\r\n> - **Clean Slate (Delete cookies/storage):** Does **not trigger** the issue. then returns after we2_consent cookie being added.\r\n> \r\n> ###  Cookies Triggering the issue:\r\n> - Key: we2_consent\r\n> - Value: {%22agreements%22:[%22ESSENTIAL%22%2C%22ANALYTICAL_PERFORMANCE%22%2C%22FUNCTIONAL_PROFILE%22%2C%22ADVERTISING_TARGETING%22]%2C%22expressed%22:false%2C%22version%22:%221.0.0%22}\r\n> \r\n> ---\r\n> \r\n> Using the following filter rules instead is a working alternative for me, for now:\r\n> \r\n> ```plaintext\r\n> ||nelo2-col.navercorp.com/_store$xhr,domain=weverse.io,badfilter\r\n> weverse.io##+js(no-xhr-if, nelo2-col.navercorp.com)\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Добрый день!\r\n> \r\n> При использовании блокировщика AdGuard показывает рекламу и баннеры, а также при случайном тапе по дисплею переводит меня на фишинговые ссылки. \r\n> \r\n> При использовании бесплатной лицензии просто обновлял фильтры, которые, увы, помогали в течение не более двух часов. \r\n> \r\n> Приобрел платную лицензию - проблема осталась прежней.\r\n> \r\n> Также добавлял назойливые ссылки на фишинговые сайты в разделе \"Пользовательские правила\".  Сначала помогало, но все равно появлялись снова, следовательно, данная функция также не помогает.\r\n> \r\n> В течение последних нескольких дней обновление фильтров и вовсе не помогает. Отключал и заново включал настройки приложения как в самом приложении, так и в настройках браузера.\r\n> \r\n> К сожалению, ничего не помогает. Только активация защиты от Adguard помогает частично. Но некоторые баннеры (как на скриншоте), так и переход на фишинговые ссылки при нажатии на окно в пределах строго определенного сайта все же остаются. \r\n> \r\n> Раньше, при использовании бесплатной лицензии, подобная проблема появлялась, но все же исчезала при деактивации/активации фильтров защиты как внутри настроек браузера, так и в настройках самого приложения. Однако на протяжении последних 30 дней никакие трюки не помогают.\r\n> \r\n> Пожалуйста, помогите.\r\nUsername: `@Jackson`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mq2xgul4bv48o4ook0o8g0occssgoowilol6zjotvc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.10\r\nSystem version: | IOS 18.5\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nOther extensions used: | Ничего другого","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207698/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2980726545","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207698#issuecomment-2980726545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207698","id":2980726545,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86xqkcR","user":{"login":"maxwestfal","id":216733343,"node_id":"U_kgDODOsWnw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216733343?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxwestfal","html_url":"https://github.com/maxwestfal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxwestfal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxwestfal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxwestfal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxwestfal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxwestfal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxwestfal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxwestfal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxwestfal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxwestfal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-17T14:59:51Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T14:59:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Предложенные Вами настройки фильтров и их обновление значительно помогли избежать проблему. \n\nСпасибо большое!

Добрый день!\r\n> \r\n> При использовании блокировщика AdGuard показывает рекламу и баннеры, а также при случайном тапе по дисплею переводит меня на фишинговые ссылки. \r\n> \r\n> При использовании бесплатной лицензии просто обновлял фильтры, которые, увы, помогали в течение не более двух часов. \r\n> \r\n> Приобрел платную лицензию - проблема осталась прежней.\r\n> \r\n> Также добавлял назойливые ссылки на фишинговые сайты в разделе \"Пользовательские правила\".  Сначала помогало, но все равно появлялись снова, следовательно, данная функция также не помогает.\r\n> \r\n> В течение последних нескольких дней обновление фильтров и вовсе не помогает. Отключал и заново включал настройки приложения как в самом приложении, так и в настройках браузера.\r\n> \r\n> К сожалению, ничего не помогает. Только активация защиты от Adguard помогает частично. Но некоторые баннеры (как на скриншоте), так и переход на фишинговые ссылки при нажатии на окно в пределах строго определенного сайта все же остаются. \r\n> \r\n> Раньше, при использовании бесплатной лицензии, подобная проблема появлялась, но все же исчезала при деактивации/активации фильтров защиты как внутри настроек браузера, так и в настройках самого приложения. Однако на протяжении последних 30 дней никакие трюки не помогают.\r\n> \r\n> Пожалуйста, помогите.\r\nUsername: `@Jackson`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mq2xgul4bv48o4ook0o8g0occssgoowilol6zjotvc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.10\r\nSystem version: | IOS 18.5\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nOther extensions used: | Ничего другого","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207698/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2980625157","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207698#issuecomment-2980625157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207698","id":2980625157,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86xqLsF","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-17T14:32:26Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T14:32:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@AdguardTeam/filters-maintainers could you also check this on your end?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2980625157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-17T14:36:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Добрый день!\r\n> \r\n> При использовании блокировщика AdGuard показывает рекламу и баннеры, а также при случайном тапе по дисплею переводит меня на фишинговые ссылки. \r\n> \r\n> При использовании бесплатной лицензии просто обновлял фильтры, которые, увы, помогали в течение не более двух часов. \r\n> \r\n> Приобрел платную лицензию - проблема осталась прежней.\r\n> \r\n> Также добавлял назойливые ссылки на фишинговые сайты в разделе \"Пользовательские правила\".  Сначала помогало, но все равно появлялись снова, следовательно, данная функция также не помогает.\r\n> \r\n> В течение последних нескольких дней обновление фильтров и вовсе не помогает. Отключал и заново включал настройки приложения как в самом приложении, так и в настройках браузера.\r\n> \r\n> К сожалению, ничего не помогает. Только активация защиты от Adguard помогает частично. Но некоторые баннеры (как на скриншоте), так и переход на фишинговые ссылки при нажатии на окно в пределах строго определенного сайта все же остаются. \r\n> \r\n> Раньше, при использовании бесплатной лицензии, подобная проблема появлялась, но все же исчезала при деактивации/активации фильтров защиты как внутри настроек браузера, так и в настройках самого приложения. Однако на протяжении последних 30 дней никакие трюки не помогают.\r\n> \r\n> Пожалуйста, помогите.\r\nUsername: `@Jackson`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mq2xgul4bv48o4ook0o8g0occssgoowilol6zjotvc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.10\r\nSystem version: | IOS 18.5\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nOther extensions used: | Ничего другого","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207698/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-17T14:33:25Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Добрый день!\r\n> \r\n> При использовании блокировщика AdGuard показывает рекламу и баннеры, а также при случайном тапе по дисплею переводит меня на фишинговые ссылки. \r\n> \r\n> При использовании бесплатной лицензии просто обновлял фильтры, которые, увы, помогали в течение не более двух часов. \r\n> \r\n> Приобрел платную лицензию - проблема осталась прежней.\r\n> \r\n> Также добавлял назойливые ссылки на фишинговые сайты в разделе \"Пользовательские правила\".  Сначала помогало, но все равно появлялись снова, следовательно, данная функция также не помогает.\r\n> \r\n> В течение последних нескольких дней обновление фильтров и вовсе не помогает.
