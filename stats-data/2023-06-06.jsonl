Проверено»\r\n- `||2ip.ru/images/anonymizer/*.png` и `||2ip.io/images/anonymizer/*.png`(скрывают само лого спонсора, все ссылки на лого их спонсора можно найти в этом CSS файле https://2ip.ru/css/anonymizer.css который подгружается при открытии странички с лого)\r\n\r\nРезультат вы можете увидеть на третьем скриншоте.
