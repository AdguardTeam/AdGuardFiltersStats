Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nAds have recently started making their way through Peacock, and seem to have been for many users.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe following rules have successfully blocked all ads on Peacock (so far):\n```\n||g*-vod-us-cmaf-prd-*.cdn.peacocktv.com  # blocks all ads\n@@||g*-vod-us-cmaf-prd-mc.cdn.peacocktv.com  # seems to allow the main content to come through.\n```\n\nWould love some feedback on if this works for anyone else.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThanks to [this list of domains](https://gist.github.com/ozankiratli/801ba17705e7f2a904d2e443af5a64f8#peacock) curated by @ozankiratli as the base of this

than on anything else, especially things like not *entirely* realising how nasty that domain parking services (which are apparently among his customers) can be in regards to malware redirections.\r\n> \r\n> **But** he has convinced me about 1 thing, which is that a lot of the entries I have/had for his company in Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List are not malware.\r\n> \r\n> I see there's precedence in AdGuard Tracking Protection Filter for blocking `||youseasky.com^`, which I can assure you is a good entry; but based on the wider patterns on https://urlscan.io/search/#page.ip:%2254.75.69.192%22, I propose 2 entries for AdGuard Tracking Protection Filter:\r\n> ```\r\n> ://euob.*.com/sxp^$script,3p\r\n> ://obseu.*.com/sxp^$script,3p\r\n>

you guys.\r\n> \r\n> I'm much too (young|old) to handle things like https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/issues/1165 being more concerned about his company's market value or something like that than on anything else, especially things like not *entirely* realising how nasty that domain parking services (which are apparently among his customers) can be in regards to malware redirections.\r\n> \r\n> **But** he has convinced me about 1 thing, which is that a lot of the entries I have/had for his company in Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List are not malware.\r\n> \r\n> I see there's precedence in AdGuard Tracking Protection Filter for blocking `||youseasky.com^`, which I can assure you is a good entry; but based on the wider patterns on https://urlscan.io/search/#page.ip:%2254.75.69.192%22, I propose 2 entries for AdGuard Tracking Protection Filter:\r\n> ```\r\n> ://euob.*.com/sxp^$script,3p\r\n> ://obseu.*.com/sxp^$script,3p\r\n>

than on anything else, especially things like not *entirely* realising how nasty that domain parking services (which are apparently among his customers) can be in regards to malware redirections.\r\n> \r\n> **But** he has convinced me about 1 thing, which is that a lot of the entries I have/had for his company in Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List are not malware.\r\n> \r\n> I see there's precedence in AdGuard Tracking Protection Filter for blocking `||youseasky.com^`, which I can assure you is a good entry; but based on the wider patterns on https://urlscan.io/search/#page.ip:%2254.75.69.192%22, I propose 2 entries for AdGuard Tracking Protection Filter:\r\n> ```\r\n> ://euob.*.com/sxp^$script,3p\r\n> ://obseu.*.com/sxp^$script,3p\r\n>

I'd like to provide more context for your consideration. \n\n1. My point on the other thread was that we serve over 15,000 customers. Most are not engaging in anything `nasty`, on the contrary (  I am willing to provide a sample of our customers in private for your reference ).   Blocking our domain using a regex harms not only those engaging in `nasty` activities, but reduces the **value** we provide to all. \n2. Our tag is not facilitating or acting as a vector to spread malware / tracking / annoyance.   In the example [https://rjotswpm.rukuten.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Frjotswpm.rukuten.com)  it might be used in a site that is considered an annoyance.\nBut it does not facilitate that activity whatsoever.  It does not spread malware, it does not track, it does not manipulate the page or create pop ups, it does no activity which can be considered as harmful and cannot be used by any customer as such.   All it does is measures whether a page visit was done by a real / automatic session. \n\n\nThe inclusion of `/sxp/i/*$script,third-party` effectively hinders our tag completely.   Is there a way to either \n1. prove and provide evidence on our usecase to you.\n2. If not, limit the scope in such a way that only speicifc tag domains (  limited to the \"offending\"  customer) will be added\n\n \n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3078563717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-16T13:14:14Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

than on anything else, especially things like not *entirely* realising how nasty that domain parking services (which are apparently among his customers) can be in regards to malware redirections.\r\n> \r\n> **But** he has convinced me about 1 thing, which is that a lot of the entries I have/had for his company in Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List are not malware.\r\n> \r\n> I see there's precedence in AdGuard Tracking Protection Filter for blocking `||youseasky.com^`, which I can assure you is a good entry; but based on the wider patterns on https://urlscan.io/search/#page.ip:%2254.75.69.192%22, I propose 2 entries for AdGuard Tracking Protection Filter:\r\n> ```\r\n> ://euob.*.com/sxp^$script,3p\r\n> ://obseu.*.com/sxp^$script,3p\r\n>

than on anything else, especially things like not *entirely* realising how nasty that domain parking services (which are apparently among his customers) can be in regards to malware redirections.\r\n> \r\n> **But** he has convinced me about 1 thing, which is that a lot of the entries I have/had for his company in Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List are not malware.\r\n> \r\n> I see there's precedence in AdGuard Tracking Protection Filter for blocking `||youseasky.com^`, which I can assure you is a good entry; but based on the wider patterns on https://urlscan.io/search/#page.ip:%2254.75.69.192%22, I propose 2 entries for AdGuard Tracking Protection Filter:\r\n> ```\r\n> ://euob.*.com/sxp^$script,3p\r\n> ://obseu.*.com/sxp^$script,3p\r\n>

be happy to answer -\n\n1. the code is obfuscated in order to make reverse engineering more difficult.  As you correctly assumed - an attacker can also block it, that's why we use a layered approach - for customers who are willing to install us also on server side, we can detect and block using server side methods.   the JS is running additional tests.  And in order to mitigate (  but unfortunately this cannot be 0%  ) the attacker attempts, we obfuscate it.\n\n2. We have integrations to SIEMs / data wharehouses / data lakes / and analytical systems.   Our customers might prefer one or the other depending on what they know and have.   Data attributes are an extension of `automatic session / human`\n\n3. All our customers are paid customers.   Some are large enterprises, and some are in the adtech business. Some Adtech customers might use us on parked domains.  I understand the concerns you have regarding parked domains, however the customer's dont always have control on where they are placed,  and even if they do , it is not strictly non legitimate.   All I'm asking is that in case you do find it illegitimate, at the very list block the explicit JS domain the customer uses.  In this manner other customers who have done nothing wrong will not be impacted.\n\n4. We collect data only in what data can help us to detect illegitimate traffic. We do not use it to track users what so ever.
