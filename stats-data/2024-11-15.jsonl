I generally use ublock in the browser on PC. Its logger is much more successful than Adguard's. (Even if I allow the blocked link in the Adguard logger, it can remain blocked when I refresh the page. It comes back after a few tries, etc.) I allow the blocked script or url and see if the adblock warning goes away. It's like a trial and error method.  But after a certain experience, you see that it usually gives adblock warnings over similar script blocking. (_ima3.js_ - _pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js_ - _googletagmanager.com_ etc.) Of course, I can't do anything about the complex ones. My knowledge of scripts is very, very little.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2479064225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-15T14:51:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
