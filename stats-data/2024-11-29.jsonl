I have spot two issues here. First with `AdGuard DNS` the widget not load because of filter `||cpdsrv.de^` -> t.cpdsrv.de gets blocked and prevent loading widget. But it's not only the blocked DNS, it is also the way of Cookie Pop-up solution. So after unblocking `cpdsrv.de` when you press \"Alle Akzeptieren\", the widget is still blocked. You need to press \"Einstellungen\" and \"Auswahl Speichern\" (this does not simply accept all trackers), the widget will load. Your current solution Accept all. A video will follow. Maybe you can find a solution here.\r\n> 3: Ad placeholder\r\n> 4: Outbrain Ad placeholder\r\n> 5-6: Ad placeholder on iPhone (screenshot shows 2 of 4 examples)\r\nUsername: `@Morku`\r\n\r\n###

I have spot two issues here. First with `AdGuard DNS` the widget not load because of filter `||cpdsrv.de^` -> t.cpdsrv.de gets blocked and prevent loading widget. But it's not only the blocked DNS, it is also the way of Cookie Pop-up solution. So after unblocking `cpdsrv.de` when you press \"Alle Akzeptieren\", the widget is still blocked. You need to press \"Einstellungen\" and \"Auswahl Speichern\" (this does not simply accept all trackers), the widget will load. Your current solution Accept all. A video will follow. Maybe you can find a solution here.\r\n> 3: Ad placeholder\r\n> 4: Outbrain Ad placeholder\r\n> 5-6: Ad placeholder on iPhone (screenshot shows 2 of 4 examples)\r\nUsername: `@Morku`\r\n\r\n###

Comment\r\n> 1-2: The read article on widget not load. I have spot two issues here. First with `AdGuard DNS` the widget not load because of filter `||cpdsrv.de^` -> t.cpdsrv.de gets blocked and prevent loading widget. But it's not only the blocked DNS, it is also the way of Cookie Pop-up solution. So after unblocking `cpdsrv.de` when you press \"Alle Akzeptieren\", the widget is still blocked. You need to press \"Einstellungen\" and \"Auswahl Speichern\" (this does not simply accept all trackers), the widget will load. Your current solution Accept all. A video will follow. Maybe you can find a solution here.\r\n> 3: Ad placeholder\r\n> 4: Outbrain Ad placeholder\r\n> 5-6: Ad placeholder on iPhone (screenshot shows 2 of 4 examples)\r\nUsername: `@Morku`\r\n\r\n###
