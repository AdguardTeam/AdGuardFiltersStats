that if I search for certain content, I end up with a blank page.  The search results will briefly flash on the screen before the page goes blank.  After doing a bunch of random searches, it seems this is only an issue when searching for TV shows or movies.  If I search for a person, place or thing, I have not had any issues.  When Adguard is off, I have no issues.  \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/e4kLTtT.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/3421g1l.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.11\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | proxy\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nUserscripts: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-04-16T17:41:36Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
