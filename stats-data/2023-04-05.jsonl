email it did not refresh . If I send email it never sends.. if I disable adguard it works right away.. I can't see much in the adguard logs either ..\r\n> \r\n> Also had issues with Android auto so disabled DNS filtering which helped, Ajay issues with WhatsApp not sending images quickly (fiddle adguard and images instantly send) also mygov medicare Australian government app can't login when adguard is laoded due to blocking Google analytics it seems allowed that and seems to be working now...
