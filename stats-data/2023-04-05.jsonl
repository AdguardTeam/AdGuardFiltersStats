email it did not refresh . If I send email it never sends.. if I disable adguard it works right away.. I can't see much in the adguard logs either ..\r\n> \r\n> Also had issues with Android auto so disabled DNS filtering which helped, Ajay issues with WhatsApp not sending images quickly (fiddle adguard and images instantly send) also mygov medicare Australian government app can't login when adguard is laoded due to blocking Google analytics it seems allowed that and seems to be working now...

`@SupMyG96`\r\n> This problem happens occasionally, every 1 week I would estimate. \r\n> Firstly the video doesn't autoplay, only showing a thumbnail of an ad with the red youtube play button. \r\n> When it's pressed it goes into a loop where the rotating half circle appears, this never proceeds on its own and I have to reload the page at least 10 times before the video starts. \r\n> Note that the ad never gets played.\r\n> \r\n> The issue persists on all Youtube videos that I try to watch for an hour or so until the ad blocker seems to recognise the ad and blocks it instead of getting halted at the thumbnail-infinite-loop-problem.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you in advance and thank you for being the best ad blocker! Your work is greatly appreciated.\r\n> Best wishes \r\n> Ernest Smailagic\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/lawgopo.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/hSqKPuW.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.12\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1497145883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-04-05T08:54:57Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> This problem happens occasionally, every 1 week I would estimate. \r\n> Firstly the video doesn't autoplay, only showing a thumbnail of an ad with the red youtube play button. \r\n> When it's pressed it goes into a loop where the rotating half circle appears, this never proceeds on its own and I have to reload the page at least 10 times before the video starts. \r\n> Note that the ad never gets played.\r\n> \r\n> The issue persists on all Youtube videos that I try to watch for an hour or so until the ad blocker seems to recognise the ad and blocks it instead of getting halted at the thumbnail-infinite-loop-problem.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you in advance and thank you for being the best ad blocker! Your work is greatly appreciated.\r\n> Best wishes \r\n> Ernest Smailagic\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/lawgopo.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/hSqKPuW.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.12\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1497136795/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-04-05T08:47:24Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Не блокируется Яндекс реклама. Всеми сервисами и поиском Яндекса не пользуюсь. Есть аналоги. Я хочу полностью заблокировать весь Яндекс, кинопоиск, все его сервисы вместе с рекламой. Чтобы всё это не открывалось во всех браузерах. На уровне операционной системы. Штатным фаерволом. У меня Windows 10. С последствиями совершения моих действий согласен. Домены: dzen.ru yandex.ru yastatic.net / Заблокировал IP: 5.255.255.5 5.255.255.50 5.255.255.55 5.255.255.60 62.217.160.2 77.88.55.66 77.88.55.70 77.88.55.77 77.88.55.80 178.154.131.215-178.154.131.217 / Какие ещё домены?
