But they do not catch most of Admiral domains, say, \r\n`https://aliasanvil.com/v2buofj3GtkNgN5i_HpKdhXQcR0H-0FUXZz8Ve2S2SeH7GuEEL3YrWAc` from https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/16731 - not caught\r\n`https://shiveringspot.com/v2cuhVlPdAl7d8Q7X7QJfIeC77AsxPA02VeJsMnr-GByZturvdBnwStA` from https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/52434 - not caught\r\n`https://magicaljoin.com/v2csbc1vWhMePZG5y3Rz9Na9buGRwkT-Ct8xF7JTmTUuzhJAeZGsO8G4` - from https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142024 - not caught\r\n\r\nI've been using the suggested rule here and this actually catches all the above, and I haven't experienced single false positive. I also checked some of those excluded domain and don't see my rule incorrectly blocks something. Only downside is it uses lookahead not compatible with some platforms, but AFAIK the current rules are not compatible with CB too.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are met\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142877/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1429699325","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pull/142877#issuecomment-1429699325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142877","id":1429699325,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85VN3r9","user":{"login":"Yuki2718","id":58900598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTAwNTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58900598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718","html_url":"https://github.com/Yuki2718","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-14T12:52:11Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T12:52:11Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"BTW shouldn't the same rule be added to TPF?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1429699325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-14T12:52:11Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I also checked some of those excluded domain and don't see my rule incorrectly blocks something. Only downside is it uses lookahead not compatible with some platforms, but AFAIK the current rules are not compatible with CB too.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that

Your comment\r\n\r\nI'm surprised to see such a too rough rules and the fact they survived with only a handful of exception. But they do not catch most of Admiral domains, say, \r\n`https://aliasanvil.com/v2buofj3GtkNgN5i_HpKdhXQcR0H-0FUXZz8Ve2S2SeH7GuEEL3YrWAc` from https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/16731 - not caught\r\n`https://shiveringspot.com/v2cuhVlPdAl7d8Q7X7QJfIeC77AsxPA02VeJsMnr-GByZturvdBnwStA` from https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/52434 - not caught\r\n`https://magicaljoin.com/v2csbc1vWhMePZG5y3Rz9Na9buGRwkT-Ct8xF7JTmTUuzhJAeZGsO8G4` - from https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142024 - not caught\r\n\r\nI've been using the suggested rule here and this actually catches all the above, and I haven't experienced single false positive. I also checked some of those excluded domain and don't see my rule incorrectly blocks something. Only downside is it uses lookahead not compatible with some platforms, but AFAIK the current rules are not compatible with CB too.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are met\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142877/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1429848288","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pull/142877#issuecomment-1429848288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142877","id":1429848288,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85VOcDg","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-14T14:37:11Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T14:37:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is not necessary, but it would be nice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1429848288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-14T14:37:11Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I also checked some of those excluded domain and don't see my rule incorrectly blocks something. Only downside is it uses lookahead not compatible with some platforms, but AFAIK the current rules are not compatible with CB too.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are met\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142877/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1429836344","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pull/142877#issuecomment-1429836344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142877","id":1429836344,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85VOZI4","user":{"login":"Yuki2718","id":58900598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTAwNTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58900598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718","html_url":"https://github.com/Yuki2718","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-14T14:29:31Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T14:29:31Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Should hyphen and underscore be the last e.g. `[-_0-9a-zA-Z]` => `[0-9a-zA-Z_-]`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1429836344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-14T14:29:32Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Your comment\r\n\r\nI'm surprised to see such a too rough rules and the fact they survived with only a handful of exception. But they do not catch most of Admiral domains, say, \r\n`https://aliasanvil.com/v2buofj3GtkNgN5i_HpKdhXQcR0H-0FUXZz8Ve2S2SeH7GuEEL3YrWAc` from https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/16731 - not caught\r\n`https://shiveringspot.com/v2cuhVlPdAl7d8Q7X7QJfIeC77AsxPA02VeJsMnr-GByZturvdBnwStA` from https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/52434 - not caught\r\n`https://magicaljoin.com/v2csbc1vWhMePZG5y3Rz9Na9buGRwkT-Ct8xF7JTmTUuzhJAeZGsO8G4` - from https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142024 - not caught\r\n\r\nI've been using the suggested rule here and this actually catches all the above, and I haven't experienced single false positive. I also checked some of those excluded domain and don't see my rule incorrectly blocks something. Only downside is it uses lookahead not compatible with some platforms, but AFAIK the current rules are not compatible with CB too.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that

I also checked some of those excluded domain and don't see my rule incorrectly blocks something. Only downside is it uses lookahead not compatible with some platforms, but AFAIK the current rules are not compatible with CB too.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that

I also checked some of those excluded domain and don't see my rule incorrectly blocks something. Only downside is it uses lookahead not compatible with some platforms, but AFAIK the current rules are not compatible with CB too.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that
