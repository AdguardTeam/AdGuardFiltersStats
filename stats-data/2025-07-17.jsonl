Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nAds have recently started making their way through Peacock, and seem to have been for many users.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe following rules have successfully blocked all ads on Peacock (so far):\n```\n||g*-vod-us-cmaf-prd-*.cdn.peacocktv.com  # blocks all ads\n@@||g*-vod-us-cmaf-prd-mc.cdn.peacocktv.com  # seems to allow the main content to come through.\n```\n\nWould love some feedback on if this works for anyone else.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThanks to [this list of domains](https://gist.github.com/ozankiratli/801ba17705e7f2a904d2e443af5a64f8#peacock) curated
