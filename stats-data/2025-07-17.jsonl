Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nAds have recently started making their way through Peacock, and seem to have been for many users.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe following rules have successfully blocked all ads on Peacock (so far):\n```\n||g*-vod-us-cmaf-prd-*.cdn.peacocktv.com  # blocks all ads\n@@||g*-vod-us-cmaf-prd-mc.cdn.peacocktv.com  # seems to allow the main content to come through.\n```\n\nWould love some feedback on if this works for anyone else.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThanks to [this list of domains](https://gist.github.com/ozankiratli/801ba17705e7f2a904d2e443af5a64f8#peacock) curated by @ozankiratli as the base of this

Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nAds have recently started making their way through Peacock, and seem to have been for many users.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe following rules have successfully blocked all ads on Peacock (so far):\n```\n||g*-vod-us-cmaf-prd-*.cdn.peacocktv.com  # blocks all ads\n@@||g*-vod-us-cmaf-prd-mc.cdn.peacocktv.com  # seems to allow the main content to come through.\n```\n\nWould love some feedback on if this works for anyone else.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThanks to [this list of domains](https://gist.github.com/ozankiratli/801ba17705e7f2a904d2e443af5a64f8#peacock) curated by @ozankiratli as the base of this solution.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209149/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209149/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3082023647","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209149#issuecomment-3082023647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209149","id":3082023647,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM863s_Lf","user":{"login":"mrrobotnic","id":31837948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODM3OTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31837948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrrobotnic","html_url":"https://github.com/mrrobotnic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrrobotnic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrrobotnic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrrobotnic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrrobotnic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrrobotnic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrrobotnic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrrobotnic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrrobotnic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrrobotnic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-17T01:05:44Z","updated_at":"2025-07-17T01:05:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@alechouse97

description\n\nUnder false assumption of meaningful consent from a browser user Mellowtel enables a scheme where an unauthorized proxy is installed as browser extension to fetch arbitrary data over

Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nAds have recently started making their way through Peacock, and seem to have been for many users.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe following rules have successfully blocked all ads on Peacock (so far):\n```\n||g*-vod-us-cmaf-prd-*.cdn.peacocktv.com  # blocks all ads\n@@||g*-vod-us-cmaf-prd-mc.cdn.peacocktv.com  # seems to allow the main content to come through.\n```\n\nWould love some feedback on if this works for anyone else.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThanks to [this list of domains](https://gist.github.com/ozankiratli/801ba17705e7f2a904d2e443af5a64f8#peacock) curated by @ozankiratli as the base of this solution.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209149/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209149/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3083763000","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209149#issuecomment-3083763000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209149","id":3083763000,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM863zn04","user":{"login":"jordansworld","id":180710643,"node_id":"U_kgDOCsVs8w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180710643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld","html_url":"https://github.com/jordansworld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-17T11:51:32Z","updated_at":"2025-07-17T11:51:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"i

ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.
