There is no rule to hide the ad placeholders. On PCs, blocking the script results in a size of zero. However, on iPhones, because the iframe remains, it's natural that the ad frame does not disappear. If there are other causes for this issue, I would appreciate learning about them for future reference. \r\n> \r\n> `class=\"row one-column trevda  mobile  alt\"`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bvpfx854gq0o0w8wcoo0cwo04wwcgsk9mxzuckmglc.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.5\r\nSystem version: | 17.5.1\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/188493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/188493/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2352362621","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/188493#issuecomment-2352362621","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/188493","id":2352362621,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86MNjR9","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-16T09:02:24Z","updated_at":"2024-09-16T09:02:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has been open for 4 days with no activity.\nUnfortunately, our resources are limited and we can not always take the time to respond to requests about websites that are not popular enough.
