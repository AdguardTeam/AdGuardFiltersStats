Comment\r\n> Last week, Google’s AI Overview started appearing in my search results. It doesn’t appear on every search, but I find it highly annoying when it does. I’ve tried utilizing user rules to block it via cosmetic filtering (alongside other annoyances such as “People also ask”, People also search for”, and “Get the answer you’re looking for added to the web”), but I haven’t had any success with user rules on iOS. The element picker doesn’t seem to be able to pull the correct CSS elements and rules posted in forums such as r/uBlockOrigin have no effect.\r\nUsername: `@N/A`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/semuzr8o98g4s4c0oo8wswkso04kk4krkxlpft82qo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2efi45n03l348c8k4c4skks0gk0scs8mtsyrpgkayo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oz2r0tqeonkc8gg4os8swgkc0sgc8kg1xzzm69pool.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.5\r\nSystem version: | iOS, 17.6.1\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.cloudflare.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Phishing URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nOther extensions used: | 1Password, Amplosion, Sink It for Reddit, Web Inspector","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2297945210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-20T04:32:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

( [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing#264](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing/issues/264) )\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n> Please check that there no another web browser extension that has adblocking feature is enabled on your web browser. It can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \r\n> Saving memory feature of your web browser or sleep feature of your operating system can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n> In this case, please re-enable AdGuard's filtering by toggling the protection toggle.\r\n> Following the instructions can be needed.\r\n\r\n### The instructions\r\n1. Force to update the filters by clicking the reload button in AdGuard Browser Extension/AdGuard mobile or update tray menu in your system tray. [^2]\r\n2. Reload the YouTube webpage without cache by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> [^3].\r\n3. Clear cache, cookies and site data of your web browser.\r\n4. Re-open your web browser completely (checking your system monitor[^4] will be better).\r\n\r\n[^1]: https://gitlab.com/adblockinc/ext/adblockplus/adblockplusui/-/issues/1576\r\n[^2]: [AdGuard for Windows](https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-windows/overview/#tray-menu); [AdGuard for Mac](https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-mac/overview/#updates-check); \r\n[^3]: On macOS, <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>\r\n[^4]: Task Manager on Windows, System Monitor on GNOME Shell, KDE System Guard on KDE Plasma or Activity Monitor on macOS. \r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious issue https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178790","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184282/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2298599867","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184282#issuecomment-2298599867","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184282","id":2298599867,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86JAdm7","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-20T11:12:46Z","updated_at":"2024-08-20T11:12:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Annoyance)\r\n [https://www.youtube.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> При использовании прокси появляются куки-уведомления.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/5ueruyukj4sggwsog08k0w08ckgggw0r8xr98nyvfk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.64\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | opera-proxy","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2298599867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-20T11:12:48Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Hello.\r\n> \r\n> First of all, I would like to inform you that in order to send this application, I had to switch from the alpha version of the Adguard application for Windows to the stable version, because in the alpha version the application form does not detect any settings of my program.\r\n> \r\n> The above report concerns Disney+, namely the VOD platform, when Adguard is active it takes a very long time to load even though according to the browser the page is already loaded.\r\n> \r\n> This makes it quite difficult to use the VOD service on your computer\r\n> \r\n> Additionally, I will add that I checked whether this is caused by one of the blocking lists I use and I can confirm with full confidence that this is not the case, and the website only starts working properly when the entire Windows application is suspended. disabling filtering from the assistant plugin has no effect.\r\nUsername: `@grzenio22`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n

Comment\r\n> Hello.\r\n> \r\n> First of all, I would like to inform you that in order to send this application, I had to switch from the alpha version of the Adguard application for Windows to the stable version, because in the alpha version the application form does not detect any settings of my program.\r\n> \r\n> The above report concerns Disney+, namely the VOD platform, when Adguard is active it takes a very long time to load even though according to the browser the page is already loaded.\r\n> \r\n> This makes it quite difficult to use the VOD service on your computer\r\n> \r\n> Additionally, I will add that I checked whether this is caused by one of the blocking lists I use and I can confirm with full confidence that this is not the case, and the website only starts working properly when the entire Windows application is suspended. disabling filtering from the assistant plugin has no effect.\r\nUsername: `@grzenio22`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n

Comment\r\n> Hello.\r\n> \r\n> First of all, I would like to inform you that in order to send this application, I had to switch from the alpha version of the Adguard application for Windows to the stable version, because in the alpha version the application form does not detect any settings of my program.\r\n> \r\n> The above report concerns Disney+, namely the VOD platform, when Adguard is active it takes a very long time to load even though according to the browser the page is already loaded.\r\n> \r\n> This makes it quite difficult to use the VOD service on your computer\r\n> \r\n> Additionally, I will add that I checked whether this is caused by one of the blocking lists I use and I can confirm with full confidence that this is not the case, and the website only starts working properly when the entire Windows application is suspended. disabling filtering from the assistant plugin has no effect.\r\nUsername: `@grzenio22`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n
