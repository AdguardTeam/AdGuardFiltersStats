Comment\r\n> Last week, Google’s AI Overview started appearing in my search results. It doesn’t appear on every search, but I find it highly annoying when it does. I’ve tried utilizing user rules to block it via cosmetic filtering (alongside other annoyances such as “People also ask”, People also search for”, and “Get the answer you’re looking for added to the web”), but I haven’t had any success with user rules on iOS. The element picker doesn’t seem to be able to pull the correct CSS elements and rules posted in forums such as r/uBlockOrigin have no effect.\r\nUsername: `@N/A`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/semuzr8o98g4s4c0oo8wswkso04kk4krkxlpft82qo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2efi45n03l348c8k4c4skks0gk0scs8mtsyrpgkayo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oz2r0tqeonkc8gg4os8swgkc0sgc8kg1xzzm69pool.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.5\r\nSystem version: | iOS, 17.6.1\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.cloudflare.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Phishing URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nOther extensions used: | 1Password, Amplosion, Sink It for Reddit, Web Inspector","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2297945210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-20T04:32:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
