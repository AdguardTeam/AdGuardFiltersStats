Twitch in particular is the most annoying aspect of being unable to block ads mostly because they're all injected. So if there's anyway taht you can make it so that AdGuard can \"de-ject\" advertisements that would be great. And also using the \"block element\" feature just breaks it completely so I'd also suggest a fix on that too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2367072239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-09-23T00:55:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> See https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/5101 , NPR pages freeze on first load seemingly due to a pop-up failing to load (not being block correctly?) which makes scrolling impossible. I just tested on this NPR article https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/nx-s1-5121176/fda-flumist-flu-vaccine-at-home-approved in Chrome Incognito mode on Android 14. Interestingly after refreshing the frozen page it loads fine, so it appears to only be an issue on the first load of an NPR page in an Incognito session (for non-Incognito Chrome, seemingly if NPR has ever been loaded before subsequent articles load fine, so I guess it only applies on the first time an NPR article is loaded).\r\n> \r\n> After pausing Adguard and loading a new Incognito session of the same article, I'm fairly certain the pop-up \"Get the app\" for NPR's own app is likely what is causing the page to freeze, it's probably being blocked in such a way that the page can't be scrolled after it fails to load?\r\n> ![Screenshot_20240921-125241](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dffa649e-6b7e-420a-ab3a-4ff6fd7a0eee)\r\n> \r\n> Edit2: After some additional testing, I've narrowed it down to the \"AdGuard Popups filter\".

If you'd rather skip all updates until the next major or minor version, let me know by commenting `@dependabot ignore this major version` or `@dependabot ignore this minor version`. You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.\n\nIf you change your mind, just re-open this PR and I'll resolve any conflicts on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2367553805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":{"id":29110,"client_id":"Iv1.4f9a6346434f815e","slug":"dependabot","node_id":"MDM6QXBwMjkxMTA=","owner":{"login":"github","id":9919,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github","html_url":"https://github.com/github","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"name":"Dependabot","description":"","external_url":"https://dependabot-api.githubapp.com","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","created_at":"2019-04-16T22:34:25Z","updated_at":"2024-03-20T21:06:35Z","permissions":{"actions":"read","checks":"write","contents":"write","issues":"write","members":"read","metadata":"read","pull_requests":"write","statuses":"read","vulnerability_alerts":"read","workflows":"write"},"events":["check_suite","issues","issue_comment","label","pull_request","pull_request_review","pull_request_review_comment","repository"]}}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-09-23T08:34:25Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
