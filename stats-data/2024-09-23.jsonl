Twitch in particular is the most annoying aspect of being unable to block ads mostly because they're all injected. So if there's anyway taht you can make it so that AdGuard can \"de-ject\" advertisements that would be great. And also using the \"block element\" feature just breaks it completely so I'd also suggest a fix on that too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2367072239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-09-23T00:55:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
