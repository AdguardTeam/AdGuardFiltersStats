thanks for the additional info.\n\nBefore my last message, I did actually try unblocking all rules in the filtering log, but this had no effect on the issue.  There is no “Unlock all” option that I can see in the Filtering Log though.  What I did was unblock all rules in the Blocked section until all of them were unblocked, and the list was clear.  But since neither the **AdGuard URL Tracking filter** nor the **Legitimate URL Shortener** show up in the list (as you can see here below), unblocking the rules from other filters has no effect on the error.\n\n<img width=\"1395\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/761aa813-ab65-4075-a070-9bf20b32620e\" />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2692044106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-01T07:46:01Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
