First, ads didn’t be blocked at all. Only at a minority of app Adguard works, and for the common apps like Internet or Youtube Adguard doesn’t work at all. Second, some applications do not work while using Adguard. It makes me really uncomfortable. I need to stop operating Adguard and can use the other apps.\r\n> Actually, I already asked about my first problems before and you answered ‘adjust HTTPS filter.’ However, I already adjusted that filter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tlw6sjp4p3k8c880scgk4cg0g44kcw06djgvinogh0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 10\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101;4.1.101\r\nBrowser: | Samsung Browser\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>EasyList, <br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>List-KR\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162174/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-22T00:49:36Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

enabled, there is a bar up the top that can’t be selected with AdGuard’s element picker.\r\n> \r\n> When AdGuard is disabled, an ad is shown, which actually covers an area greater than the bar itself,
