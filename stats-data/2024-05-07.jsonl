— the process of monitoring and collecting data about users and their interactions with websites and applications for marketing purposes, as well as to obtain telemetry about the functioning of websites or applications for the purpose of analyzing their operation. This process includes tracking visited pages, time spent, interaction with website elements (e.g., clicks, form submissions), and other metrics. It allows website and application owners to better understand user behavior, optimize functionality, and adapt marketing strategies. Tracking is also used to monitor performance, usage patterns, and identify issues, providing developers with the necessary data to improve the stability and quality of the website or application. Even if the data obtained cannot reveal a person’s identity, such actions are still considered tracking.\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2097796813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-07T08:59:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

The <script> that download and injects this crap sits right inside the main HTML body and also mentions some ausoafab.net domain.\r\n> \r\n> Best way to reproduce this is to open a new private tab/window, usually shortly after starting Safari.

This site inserts a massive div or iframe over the entire site after loading that sends you to adware. And only rarely does AdGuard block any of this. I suspect it's a <div> with a constantly changing class name and \"style=\"pointer events:\"\r\n> \r\n> It then redirects me through these sites to some crappy McAffe scam saying that my Mac is infected, all bypassing AdGuard:\r\n> \r\n> bihussufoob.net\r\n> update-macos.com\r\n> gommellognamost.com / prollachiluns.com\r\n> \r\n> Of course most of these are domains created just days ago to get around filters.\r\n> \r\n> When I check the console after AdGuard actually starts blocking it, it says that it's a JS from bihussufoob.net injected to the page that causes this. The <script> that download and injects this crap sits right inside the main HTML body and also mentions some ausoafab.net domain.\r\n> \r\n> Best way to reproduce this is to open a new private tab/window, usually shortly after starting Safari. I don't know how this all bypasses a fully up-to-date AdGuard and only rarely gets blocked after several reloads.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/5m1tezolfqo8cwcco8w888wowkggwk0dhsbesvzrtk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.17\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178442/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2097744213","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178442#issuecomment-2097744213","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178442","id":2097744213,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM859CQlV","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-07T08:31:36Z","updated_at":"2024-05-07T08:31:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It seems that your problem is related to limitation of Safari WebExtension API.\r\nIt works well on another web browser.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2097744213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-07T08:31:38Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
