Man muss den ADGUARD-Client komplett deaktivieren und dann den Browser neu starten.

Not possible for MV3 due to rediculous memory limit, see [w3c/webextensions#344 (comment)](https://github.com/w3c/webextensions/issues/344#issuecomment-2775313455) But should be possible for Safari. BTW I've been observing them for years and now they only use `.com`, so `(?:com|bid|link|live|online|top|club)` can be simplified to `com`.\n\nI think for MV3, adding per-domain would be still OK. I see there are some `denyallow` rules for other ads types but not this one I think. If there are none for this type yet, I think we can have 2 ways:\n\n- Using the beginning part like at https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/07d2212a78de1ef00abca687e4d177367a0ff720/BaseFilter/sections/specific.txt#L20169:\n\n```adblock\n/^https?:\\/\\/(?:www\\.|[a-z0-9]{7,10}\\.)?[a-z0-9-]{5,}\\.(?:com|bid|link|live|online|top|club)\\//$script,xmlhttprequest,third-party,redirect=noopjs,domain=tokyomotion.net\n```\n\n- Using the ending part:\n\n```adblock\n/\\/[a-f0-9]{32}\\.js(?:$|\\?)/$script,xmlhttprequest,third-party,redirect=noopjs,domain=tokyomotion.net\n```\n\n---\n\n> Does ... work for Safari?\n\nThanks.
