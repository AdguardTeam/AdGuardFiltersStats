Sometimes, these redirects attempt to download malware or force interactions with deceptive pages. This behaviour makes interacting with the intended website impossible without triggering these unwanted actions.\r\n> \r\n> Steps to Reproduce:\r\n> - Open AdGuard with filtering enabled.\r\n> - Navigate to 1337x.to or similar torrent-related websites.\r\n> - Attempt to click on any part of the page.\r\n> - Observe that a new tab or pop-up appears, sometimes prompting a malware download.\r\n> \r\n> Expected Behaviour:\r\n> AdGuard should block these intrusive pop-ups and prevent malicious redirects.\r\n> \r\n> Actual Behavior:\r\n> The page takeover occurs despite AdGuard being active, allowing unwanted pop-ups and redirects.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/a0ndlrlcf4g8sckscogkk04w80gk80ckehnspk36cg.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.3 (4994)\r\nSystem version: | Edition\tWindows 11 Pro Version\t24H2 Installed on\t‎2025-‎03-‎28 OS build\t26100.3915 Experience\tWindows Feature Experience Pack 1000.26100.83.0\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests<br><br>**Browser API**:<br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID, <br>Disable Windows Defender automatic samples submission, <br>Disable WAP Push Message Routing Service<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://d.adguard-dns.com/dns-query/xxxxxxx`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`, `User rules (url: none)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List\r\nCustom filters: | User rules (url: none)\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=true&custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.custom_bootstrap=&dns.custom_fallback=&dns.custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_mode=System&dns.filters=1&dns.servers=https%3A%2F%2Fd.adguard-dns.com%2Fdns-query%2Fxxxxxxx&dns.timeout=0&extensions=AdGuard%2520Extra%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29%2CAdGuard%2520Popup%2520Blocker%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fpopup-blocker%2F2.5%2Fpopupblocker.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=2.3.4.11.17.18.19.20.21.22.207&license_type=paid&product_type=Win&product_version=7.20.3+%284994%29&referrer=&scheme_version=2&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_third_party_auth=false&stealth.block_trackers=true&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=true&stealth.disable_wap_push_message_routing_service=true&stealth.disable_windows_defender=true&stealth.disable_windows_telemetry=true&stealth.dpi=true&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.flash=false&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.java=false&stealth.location=false&stealth.push=true&stealth.strip_url=true&stealth.third_party_cookies=180&stealth.turn_off_advertising_id=true&stealth.webrtc=true&stealth.x_client=true&system_version=Microsoft+Windows+NT+10.0.26100.0&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F136.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36+Edg%2F136.0.0.0&win.wfp=true)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205302/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-13T19:14:23Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
