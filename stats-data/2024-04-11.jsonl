Adam\r\n\r\nThanks for your help thus far.\r\n\r\nI added this rule to _user rules_ on the MV3 version of the AdGuard extension - `sbs.com.au#%#(()=>{const e=window.Promise,o={construct:(o,t,n)=>t[0]&&t[0]?.toString()?.includes(\"[!1,!1,!1,!1]\")&&t[0]?.toString()?.includes(\".responseText\")?e.resolve(!1):Reflect.construct(o,t,n)},t=new Proxy(window.Promise,o);Object.defineProperty(window,\"Promise\",{set:e=>{},get:()=>t})})();` \r\n\r\nThat rule does successfully get the videos on sbs.com.au to play ad-free via the MV3 version of the AdGuard extension, however the history sync function does not work. It's exactly the same thing as the regular version of the AdGuard extension as well; which via the **AdGuard Base Filter** also allows me to stream video ad-free but with no history sync functionality either.\r\n\r\nThe  **AdGuard Base Filter** on the regular version of the AdGuard extension is the only Adblocking filter that will actually let me stream on sbs.com.au. The other filters like **Easylist** & **AdGuard Mobile Ads filter**  when one or both are enabled and with **AdGuard Base Filter** disabled, give me a 'Adblocker Detected Video Play Error' message. \r\n\r\nWhen all 3 of **AdGuard Base Filter,** **Easylist** & **AdGuard Mobile Ads filter** are enabled at the same time videos will play, but the history sync function issue remains.\r\n\r\n> I was able to reproduce the problem with history sync function and have modified a rule, it should fixes a problem (at least it worked fine on my end). Please update filters after about 2 hours and then check again.\r\n\r\nSo this is for the regular version of the Adguard extension? And are you saying that videos on sbs.com.au will play ad-free and also with the history sync function in tact too?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2049270692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-11T09:17:25Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
