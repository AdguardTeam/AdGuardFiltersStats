сервисах яндекса использует алгоритмы рандомайзера по максимуму, я видел 15-20 рандомных символов в шапках <div>, и такие же рандомные шапки держат и остальной контент, единственный способ заблочить такое по моему мнению это создать лист на 2-5 гигабайт со всеми комбинациями или самыми частыми частями этих комбинаций если возможно.

сервисах яндекса использует алгоритмы рандомайзера по максимуму, я видел 15-20 рандомных символов в шапках <div>, и такие же рандомные шапки держат и остальной контент, единственный способ заблочить такое по моему мнению это создать лист на 2-5 гигабайт со всеми комбинациями или самыми частыми частями этих комбинаций если возможно.
