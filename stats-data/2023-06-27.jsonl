See #154804 for more information on the issue. I updated the latest version of the Chinese filter and found your new rules inside. But the problem remains unsolved. Instead, more intercepted requests are generated in the interception log. I also attached a picture of the interception log. Hope it can be solved soon.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/pxbmnx544esocccoow4kowcgockoo802p8mr9rvmj6.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/df0j58fjqxkcoko8gkk4c8kcc8w4c0of2gw4u27ccg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/8parv1brvbgoo80cw0s08408o80c84g917gejlv1ik.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/6fy5ls6qw88480w4k8wgcowk40g808g82fzpm71cs8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.13 nightly 16\r\nBrowser: | Edge 114.0.1823.58 (Chromium-based)\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nCustom filters: | https://deliver.flymc.cc/rules/sophie-advanced.txt\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | McAfee","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1609018581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-06-27T08:15:55Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

No matter how long you wait, the website is checking the browser.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/i5f5g8z0u1c8ws0ks0s8gg0c8s8cgsk5uf9og7p6wg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/d3st0k498gg8wgk0w8o80sgkg08kgkgmhbmtspr1q8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/hvrjx4spfs0g80oow400g4c04s8skg08j58gukchf4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.13 nightly 16\r\nBrowser: | Edge 114.0.1823.58 (Chromium-based)\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nCustom filters: | https://deliver.flymc.cc/rules/sophie-advanced.txt\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://bbs.kafan.cn/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbbs.kafan.cn%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | McAfee","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1609416125","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804#issuecomment-1609416125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804","id":1609416125,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85f7b29","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-27T12:35:08Z","updated_at":"2023-06-27T12:35:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's really strange.\r\n1.

No matter how long you wait, the website is checking the browser.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/i5f5g8z0u1c8ws0ks0s8gg0c8s8cgsk5uf9og7p6wg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/d3st0k498gg8wgk0w8o80sgkg08kgkgmhbmtspr1q8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/hvrjx4spfs0g80oow400g4c04s8skg08j58gukchf4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.13 nightly 16\r\nBrowser: | Edge 114.0.1823.58 (Chromium-based)\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nCustom filters: | https://deliver.flymc.cc/rules/sophie-advanced.txt\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://bbs.kafan.cn/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbbs.kafan.cn%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | McAfee","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1609375930","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804#issuecomment-1609375930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804","id":1609375930,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85f7SC6","user":{"login":"KevinGu0611","id":107782505,"node_id":"U_kgDOBmyhaQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107782505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinGu0611","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-27T12:11:28Z","updated_at":"2023-06-27T12:11:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> > Hm, let's do next:\r\n> > \r\n> > 1.

No matter how long you wait, the website is checking the browser.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/i5f5g8z0u1c8ws0ks0s8gg0c8s8cgsk5uf9og7p6wg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/d3st0k498gg8wgk0w8o80sgkg08kgkgmhbmtspr1q8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/hvrjx4spfs0g80oow400g4c04s8skg08j58gukchf4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.13 nightly 16\r\nBrowser: | Edge 114.0.1823.58 (Chromium-based)\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nCustom filters: | https://deliver.flymc.cc/rules/sophie-advanced.txt\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://bbs.kafan.cn/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbbs.kafan.cn%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | McAfee","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1609469053","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804#issuecomment-1609469053","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154804","id":1609469053,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85f7ox9","user":{"login":"KevinGu0611","id":107782505,"node_id":"U_kgDOBmyhaQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107782505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinGu0611","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinGu0611/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-27T13:06:52Z","updated_at":"2023-06-27T13:06:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> It's really strange.\r\n> \r\n> 1.
