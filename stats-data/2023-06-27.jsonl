See #154804 for more information on the issue. I updated the latest version of the Chinese filter and found your new rules inside. But the problem remains unsolved. Instead, more intercepted requests are generated in the interception log. I also attached a picture of the interception log. Hope it can be solved soon.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/pxbmnx544esocccoow4kowcgockoo802p8mr9rvmj6.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/df0j58fjqxkcoko8gkk4c8kcc8w4c0of2gw4u27ccg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/8parv1brvbgoo80cw0s08408o80c84g917gejlv1ik.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/6fy5ls6qw88480w4k8wgcowk40g808g82fzpm71cs8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.13 nightly 16\r\nBrowser: | Edge 114.0.1823.58 (Chromium-based)\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nCustom filters: | https://deliver.flymc.cc/rules/sophie-advanced.txt\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | McAfee","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1609018581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-06-27T08:15:55Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
