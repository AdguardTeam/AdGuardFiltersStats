Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://duckduckgo.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fduckduckgo.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Please disregard the screenshot for AdGuard being disabled. This is not necessary.\r\n> \r\n> With AdGuard Base Filter applied as a DNS filter it blocks many major sites such as duckduckgo.com. This filter as well as two others (AdGuard Mobile Ads Filter & one other one -- I forget at the moment) block major sites when applied as DNS filters. I have reported this before, but I entered the wrong github username so I didn't see any updates. Even after updating the filters just before trying this it still did not load. I imagine there are sections in these filter lists that forget to put \"//\" before a comment, and this is why they're blocking major sites.\r\n> \r\n> When I disable the AdGuard Base Filter in the DNS filters I can load duckduckgo no problem. Please fix these filter lists! Thank you.\r\nUsername: `@infinitewaveparticle`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/m3vju4j2h9ssocg00sg444s484488002wocx5q6q78.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3uyvza3c7a2oo4gwss4ssg0w0s8og8g2hnqbwnrkry.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/gecl2rmiti8ks0cgg4ggww8csoc0g8462ih4lj7vjw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/btu3qvu5lvwocss0o4s04sswoc40w8ohet328vkf4g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ghugkbzbltkw0kckscc0gcss8kocso06lkvxyzf4hk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.3 Nightly 41\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Cromite\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Hide your IP address (107.178.250.75), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (5), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://1.1.1.1/dns-query`, `https://1.0.0.1/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://abp.oisd.nl/basic/`, `https://badmojr.github.io/1Hosts/Pro/domains.txt`, `https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt`, `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/2_optimized.txt`, `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/3_optimized.txt`, `http://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/serverlist.php?hostformat=adblockplus&mimetype=plaintext`, `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/11_optimized.txt`, `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>EasyList China, <br/>KAD -

推测：某一次关闭了adguard之后，再次打开时，设置未能生效。我想知道，adguard是否在PC的其他位置中缓存了配置文件。\r\nUsername: `@MrStrangerYang`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot
