Disabling Ad blocking, privacy, internet security and extension does not fix the issue. I have to disable AdGuard for Windows entirely to make it work.\r\n> Remembered from a similar issue with `ebay.com` I have tested provided filters and only the combination of `@@||dell.com^$jsinject,elemhide,extension` does fix the issue.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/NyTSuib.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/GI1mWm6.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/S2z0lAz.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.12\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Disable cache for third-party requests\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS Non-filtering`<br>filters: `AdGuard Home with AdGuard DNS filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142773/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-17T09:18:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I believe your targeting for our JS may be too broad as it is preventing functionality on the website as demonstrated in the screenshots. We have worked hard to separate out our tracking JS from our non-tracking JS and load it via a separate subdomain. The correct targeting for tracking would be targeting static-tracking.klaviyo.com and telemetrics.klaviyo.com. Your existing targeting is preventing any of our JS from loading (tracking and non-tracking) as that file is entry to all JS being loaded.

`@nshenkman`\r\n> Hello I am Engineer at Klaviyo. I believe your targeting for our JS may be too broad as it is preventing functionality on the website as demonstrated in the screenshots. We have worked hard to separate out our tracking JS from our non-tracking JS and load it via a separate subdomain. The correct targeting for tracking would be targeting static-tracking.klaviyo.com and telemetrics.klaviyo.com. Your existing targeting is preventing any of our JS from loading (tracking and non-tracking) as that file is entry to all JS being loaded. Here are some examples of other filters (easyprivacy) using these rules: \r\n> https://github.com/easylist/easylist/blob/master/easyprivacy/easyprivacy_thirdparty.txt#L1714\r\n> https://github.com/easylist/easylist/blob/master/easyprivacy/easyprivacy_thirdparty.txt#L1871\r\n> \r\n> To help out I have linked where I think the filter is located:\r\n> https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/SpywareFilter/sections/specific.txt#L1696\r\n> \r\n> If you would like to investigate yourself the url I tested on is https://kontrolfreek.com but this issue persists on any website that uses Klaviyo.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/3YJkc2N.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/ySQahvp.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/143120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/143120/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1434756258","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/143120#issuecomment-1434756258","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/143120","id":1434756258,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85VhKSi","user":{"login":"nshenkman","id":7377088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzcwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7377088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nshenkman","html_url":"https://github.com/nshenkman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nshenkman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nshenkman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nshenkman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nshenkman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nshenkman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nshenkman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nshenkman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nshenkman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nshenkman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-17T14:53:01Z","updated_at":"2023-02-17T14:53:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1434756258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-17T14:53:01Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
