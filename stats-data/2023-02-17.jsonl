Disabling Ad blocking, privacy, internet security and extension does not fix the issue. I have to disable AdGuard for Windows entirely to make it work.\r\n> Remembered from a similar issue with `ebay.com` I have tested provided filters and only the combination of `@@||dell.com^$jsinject,elemhide,extension` does fix the issue.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/NyTSuib.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/GI1mWm6.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/S2z0lAz.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.12\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Disable cache for third-party requests\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS Non-filtering`<br>filters: `AdGuard Home with AdGuard DNS filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142773/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-17T09:18:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
