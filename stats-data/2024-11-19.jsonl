The “Create public link” button is missing.\r\n> \r\n> Note that this button's primary function is to generate a public link to the chat.  After generating the link, some social-media buttons are displayed to share the generated link on social media.

After generating the link, some social-media buttons are displayed to share the generated link on social media.  It would make sense to filter those buttons, but filtering the link-generating button removes functionality unrelated to social media.\r\nUsername: `@nisavid`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hgk94t4a7yo8c0wwk0g484w888kwg8gmxhjbg2gzeo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ja4h0tk1reo08wk4g04gs4o84csw4ccfxyyot3kejk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.41 \r\nSystem version: | Linux x86_64\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Serbo-Croatian List</details>\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/193218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/193218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-19T07:03:17Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

plays if AdGuard is \"disabled\" – that is to say, it still doesn't work if I select \"Pause filtering for 30 seconds,\" from the top of the AdGuard Assistant menu, but does if I select \"Pause AdGuard\" from the bottom of it.

Отсутствие рекламы это супер, но долго работать отключая программу каждый раз когда необходимо вложение из почты невозможно. \r\n> \r\n> \r\nUsername: `@Иван`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/czo4dvbxvpc0gsw800cw4o8cw0s4s4w7ckbds1xb2g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6mz37xypjlc880c4goc4g8sckswkk0olx3bft8v5lw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.19.0 (4853)\r\nSystem version: | windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Яндекс Браузер\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block trackers, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `User DNS filter (url: none)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>Estonian List, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters</details>\r\nCustom filters: | User filter (url: none)\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.info/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&clid=D0hTvR--DmrEYS--F5K8TM--beN6rn--JxH3VA--KlkGkJ--RSvVtF&custom_filters=User%2520filter%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.custom_bootstrap=&dns.custom_fallback=&dns.custom_filters=User%2520DNS%2520filter%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_mode=System&dns.filters=&dns.servers=System&dns.timeout=0&extensions=AdGuard%2520Extra%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29%2CAdGuard%2520Popup%2520Blocker%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fpopup-blocker%2F2.5%2Fpopupblocker.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=105.109.110.111.216.218.224.227.238.249.13.16.1.2.3.4.6.7.23&license_type=paid&product_type=Win&product_version=7.19.0+%284853%29&referrer=&scheme_version=2&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_third_party_auth=false&stealth.block_trackers=true&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=false&stealth.disable_wap_push_message_routing_service=false&stealth.disable_windows_defender=false&stealth.disable_windows_telemetry=true&stealth.dpi=false&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.flash=false&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.java=false&stealth.location=false&stealth.push=false&stealth.strip_url=false&stealth.third_party_cookies=180&stealth.turn_off_advertising_id=false&stealth.webrtc=false&stealth.x_client=true&system_version=Microsoft+Windows+NT+10.0.19045.0&url=https%3A%2F%2Fe.mail.ru%2Finbox%2F0%3A17320265830846964234%3A0%2F&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F128.0.0.0+YaBrowser%2F24.10.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&utm_campaign=report&utm_medium=assistant&utm_source=win&win.wfp=true)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2485932591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-19T14:51:33Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

web-browsers:\r\nhttps://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query\r\n\r\nAnd this one for the system-wide DNS on Android devices:\r\ntls://dns.adguard-dns.com\r\n\r\nI notice that the default filters the public DNS option uses never seem to block any of those websites\r\nthat are fake e-mail unsubscribe pages, that exist purely to harvest working e-mail addresses.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nGiven fake e-mail unsubscribe websites exist purely to collect working e-mail addresses to then send\r\nmore spam to, surely they should be classed as \"phishing\" and blocked by AdGuard DNS (and the\r\nbrowser extensions also)?\r\n\r\nThe e-mail that are sent usually either lead to other phishing or scam sites, or malware pages.\n\n### Additional information\n\nHere are some example sites I feel AdGuard DNS should be blocking:\r\n\r\n![allinoursite_com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b87ffd07-9564-4784-8af3-3659b3db2a7c)\r\n\r\n![doorsstormsy_shop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fa56ae3-22f4-49c7-9878-bff8ad32d31c)\r\n\r\n![emailservicesnetau_com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53f8e566-f590-4e53-9ad9-341abeb1faf1)\r\n\r\n![euromaillinnk_com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64c6dddf-812b-4904-9ba0-4bb1584b1e4c)\r\n\r\n![findthorman_shop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1196ea5-8fa9-4ddf-9fba-023fe24cb424)\r\n\r\n![keydoordasher_shop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/956c789d-c04e-413f-9970-3dd7022d7679)\r\n\r\n![mybach_xyz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/853ea44f-661b-4107-9378-5ddee433f18d)\r\n\r\n![threeneptuneboot_com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e39b662-2b4a-4b65-99b1-3a586da38772)\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not see any-benefit to end-users of allowing access to these sites, when they're only used to gather e-mail\r\naddresses to then send them more spam by e-mail!\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/193249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/193249/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2486525475","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/193249#issuecomment-2486525475","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/193249","id":2486525475,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86UNV4j","user":{"login":"jordansworld","id":180710643,"node_id":"U_kgDOCsVs8w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180710643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld","html_url":"https://github.com/jordansworld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-19T19:06:52Z","updated_at":"2024-11-19T19:06:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"can

Prerequisites\n\n- [X] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [X] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [X] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nI use AdGuard Public DNS, using the default option which blocks ads, trackers and malware domains.\r\n\r\nThis URL inside web-browsers:\r\nhttps://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query\r\n\r\nAnd this one for the system-wide DNS on Android devices:\r\ntls://dns.adguard-dns.com\r\n\r\nI notice that the default filters the public DNS option uses never seem to block any of those websites\r\nthat are fake e-mail unsubscribe pages, that exist purely to harvest working e-mail addresses.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nGiven fake e-mail unsubscribe websites exist purely to collect working e-mail addresses to then send\r\nmore spam to, surely they should be classed as \"phishing\" and blocked by AdGuard DNS (and the\r\nbrowser extensions also)?\r\n\r\nThe e-mail that are sent usually either lead to other phishing or scam sites, or malware pages.\n\n### Additional information\n\nHere are some example sites I feel AdGuard DNS should be blocking:\r\n\r\n![allinoursite_com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b87ffd07-9564-4784-8af3-3659b3db2a7c)\r\n\r\n![doorsstormsy_shop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fa56ae3-22f4-49c7-9878-bff8ad32d31c)\r\n\r\n![emailservicesnetau_com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53f8e566-f590-4e53-9ad9-341abeb1faf1)\r\n\r\n![euromaillinnk_com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64c6dddf-812b-4904-9ba0-4bb1584b1e4c)\r\n\r\n![findthorman_shop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1196ea5-8fa9-4ddf-9fba-023fe24cb424)\r\n\r\n![keydoordasher_shop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/956c789d-c04e-413f-9970-3dd7022d7679)\r\n\r\n![mybach_xyz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/853ea44f-661b-4107-9378-5ddee433f18d)\r\n\r\n![threeneptuneboot_com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e39b662-2b4a-4b65-99b1-3a586da38772)\r\n\r\n\r\nI

Prerequisites\n\n- [X] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [X] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [X] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nI use AdGuard Public DNS, using the default option which blocks ads, trackers and malware domains.\r\n\r\nThis URL inside web-browsers:\r\nhttps://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query\r\n\r\nAnd this one for the system-wide DNS on Android devices:\r\ntls://dns.adguard-dns.com\r\n\r\nI notice that the default filters the public DNS option uses never seem to block any of those websites\r\nthat are fake e-mail unsubscribe pages, that exist purely to harvest working e-mail addresses.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nGiven fake e-mail unsubscribe websites exist purely to collect working e-mail addresses to then send\r\nmore spam to, surely they should be classed as \"phishing\" and blocked by AdGuard DNS (and the\r\nbrowser extensions also)?\r\n\r\nThe e-mail that are sent usually either lead to other phishing or scam sites, or malware pages.\n\n### Additional information\n\nHere are some example sites I feel AdGuard DNS should be blocking:\r\n\r\n![allinoursite_com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b87ffd07-9564-4784-8af3-3659b3db2a7c)\r\n\r\n![doorsstormsy_shop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fa56ae3-22f4-49c7-9878-bff8ad32d31c)\r\n\r\n![emailservicesnetau_com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53f8e566-f590-4e53-9ad9-341abeb1faf1)\r\n\r\n![euromaillinnk_com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64c6dddf-812b-4904-9ba0-4bb1584b1e4c)\r\n\r\n![findthorman_shop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1196ea5-8fa9-4ddf-9fba-023fe24cb424)\r\n\r\n![keydoordasher_shop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/956c789d-c04e-413f-9970-3dd7022d7679)\r\n\r\n![mybach_xyz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/853ea44f-661b-4107-9378-5ddee433f18d)\r\n\r\n![threeneptuneboot_com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e39b662-2b4a-4b65-99b1-3a586da38772)\r\n\r\n\r\nI
