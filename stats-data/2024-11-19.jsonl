The “Create public link” button is missing.\r\n> \r\n> Note that this button's primary function is to generate a public link to the chat.  After generating the link, some social-media buttons are displayed to share the generated link on social media.  It would make sense to filter those buttons, but filtering the link-generating button removes functionality unrelated to social media.\r\nUsername: `@nisavid`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hgk94t4a7yo8c0wwk0g484w888kwg8gmxhjbg2gzeo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ja4h0tk1reo08wk4g04gs4o84csw4ccfxyyot3kejk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.41 \r\nSystem version: | Linux x86_64\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Serbo-Croatian List</details>\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/193218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/193218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-19T02:25:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

After generating the link, some social-media buttons are displayed to share the generated link on social media.  It would make sense to filter those buttons, but filtering the link-generating button removes functionality unrelated to social media.\r\nUsername: `@nisavid`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hgk94t4a7yo8c0wwk0g484w888kwg8gmxhjbg2gzeo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ja4h0tk1reo08wk4g04gs4o84csw4ccfxyyot3kejk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.41 \r\nSystem version: | Linux x86_64\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Serbo-Croatian List</details>\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/193218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/193218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-19T07:03:17Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
