пропускает рекламу. В новостях еще добавляется баннер после статьи. С выключенным AdGuard показывает совершенно другую рекламу. Первый скриншот - AdGuard включен, второй (салатовый) - выключен. На других поддоменах onliner пропуска рекламы замечено не было. В системе также установлен Kaspersky Standart с выключенным антибаннером. Отключение антивируса никак не влияет.
