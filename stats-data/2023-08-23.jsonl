пропускает рекламу. В новостях еще добавляется баннер после статьи. С выключенным AdGuard показывает совершенно другую рекламу. Первый скриншот - AdGuard включен, второй (салатовый) - выключен. На других поддоменах onliner пропуска рекламы замечено не было. В системе также установлен Kaspersky Standart с выключенным антибаннером. Отключение антивируса никак не влияет.

A few weeks back, a friend reached out about an open counseling position at his school. I told him there was NO WAY I could desert my baby (aka the shop) to take a counseling position, so we struck up a deal to where I could counsel part-time while keeping the same shop days &amp; hours. So that means I am officially the college &amp; career counselor at Foothill High School!! Today was my first day, and it felt good! I&#39;m excited to merge both the educator and entrepreneur in me. </div><div class=\"gmail_default\"><br></div><div class=\"gmail_default\">So this leads to my second piece of exciting news...I am able to officially hire my first employee!

If you can even tell the difference between us. 😂</div><div class=\"gmail_default\"><br></div><div class=\"gmail_default\">Basically, I just want to say thank you SO much for all the support that you&#39;ve shown Cards o&#39; Glee since we opened 17 months ago. It&#39;s terrifying to go all in on a business, but I have nothing to fear with supportive, generous, and hilarious customers like YOU. I can&#39;t wait to see what else is in the cards for Cards o&#39; Glee!!

A few weeks back, a friend reached out about an open counseling position at his school. I told him there was NO WAY I could desert my baby (aka the shop) to take a counseling position, so we struck up a deal to where I could counsel part-time while keeping the same shop days &amp; hours. So that means I am officially the college &amp; career counselor at Foothill High School!! Today was my first day, and it felt good! I&#39;m excited to merge both the educator and entrepreneur in me. </div><div class=\"gmail_default\"><br></div><div class=\"gmail_default\">So this leads to my second piece of exciting news...I am able to officially hire my first employee!
