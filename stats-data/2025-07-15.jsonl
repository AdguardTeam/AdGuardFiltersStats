shortener directly it just redirects to google.com)_\r\n\r\nSites that use it:  (Spanish downloads

seems to be that this link shortener site forces you to click on some ads to move forward. But those ads are blocked by AdGuard.\r\n\r\n_note: this link shortener site seems to save your IP address to grant you access for 24h to the downloads, once you complete the steps. This access permission is independent for each of the movie websites._\r\n\r\nthe link shortener uses these auxiliary domains: \r\n`todoandroid.live|gadgetzona.net|freeserverhostingweb.club|qwanturankpro.com|notipostingt.com`\r\n`todoandroid.live,gadgetzona.net,freeserverhostingweb.club,qwanturankpro.com,notipostingt.com`\r\nIt is in these domains where the ads should show up, so we can click them. But they are blocked, so I can't move forward through the link shortener.\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3072064389","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174863#issuecomment-3072064389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174863","id":3072064389,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM863G_uF","user":{"login":"pastormorris","id":36487100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDg3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36487100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris","html_url":"https://github.com/pastormorris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-15T05:48:51Z","updated_at":"2025-07-15T05:48:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Y ahora que hacemos con esto?\n\nhttps://www.peliculasgd.net/reminiscencia-2021-brrip-1080p-latino-googledrive-ivan092/\n\nhttps://external.neworldtravel.com/l.php?o=T29rT1laczJWUGFiaHE3UzVjZmQ0TnFGejFQUU9aN0NhUk95K2psSVppWE1oaDc1U29NWDhFR2dFcGZleDcySEpHWTd2M01LUVZZdDhSNzAzWWVkVXo4WHJ0L2QzcDU4RzJoYmVHRkQrdytyWnU0UU9CNnY2V2x1RUlwMTdSakVzeHR6RHFmaGQ2TitreGttYWthSVRLckd4N09yWkZxWS9mdFBCeGUrdEJjPQ==","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3072064389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-15T05:48:53Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

shortener directly it just redirects to google.com)_\r\n\r\nSites that use it:  (Spanish downloads

seems to be that this link shortener site forces you to click on some ads to move forward. But those ads are blocked by AdGuard.\r\n\r\n_note: this link shortener site seems to save your IP address to grant you access for 24h to the downloads, once you complete the steps. This access permission is independent for each of the movie websites._\r\n\r\nthe link shortener uses these auxiliary domains: \r\n`todoandroid.live|gadgetzona.net|freeserverhostingweb.club|qwanturankpro.com|notipostingt.com`\r\n`todoandroid.live,gadgetzona.net,freeserverhostingweb.club,qwanturankpro.com,notipostingt.com`\r\nIt is in these domains where the ads should show up, so we can click them.
