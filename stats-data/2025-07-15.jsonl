seems to be that this link shortener site forces you to click on some ads to move forward. But those ads are blocked by AdGuard.\r\n\r\n_note: this link shortener site seems to save your IP address to grant you access for 24h to the downloads, once you complete the steps. This access permission is independent for each of the movie websites._\r\n\r\nthe link shortener uses these auxiliary domains: \r\n`todoandroid.live|gadgetzona.net|freeserverhostingweb.club|qwanturankpro.com|notipostingt.com`\r\n`todoandroid.live,gadgetzona.net,freeserverhostingweb.club,qwanturankpro.com,notipostingt.com`\r\nIt is in these domains where the ads should show up, so we can click them. But they are blocked, so I can't move forward through the link shortener.\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3072064389","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174863#issuecomment-3072064389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174863","id":3072064389,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM863G_uF","user":{"login":"pastormorris","id":36487100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDg3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36487100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris","html_url":"https://github.com/pastormorris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pastormorris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-15T05:48:51Z","updated_at":"2025-07-15T05:48:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Y ahora que hacemos con esto?\n\nhttps://www.peliculasgd.net/reminiscencia-2021-brrip-1080p-latino-googledrive-ivan092/\n\nhttps://external.neworldtravel.com/l.php?o=T29rT1laczJWUGFiaHE3UzVjZmQ0TnFGejFQUU9aN0NhUk95K2psSVppWE1oaDc1U29NWDhFR2dFcGZleDcySEpHWTd2M01LUVZZdDhSNzAzWWVkVXo4WHJ0L2QzcDU4RzJoYmVHRkQrdytyWnU0UU9CNnY2V2x1RUlwMTdSakVzeHR6RHFmaGQ2TitreGttYWthSVRLckd4N09yWkZxWS9mdFBCeGUrdEJjPQ==","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3072064389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-15T05:48:53Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

seems to be that this link shortener site forces you to click on some ads to move forward.

the mechanism requires clicking the ad and waiting for 15 seconds to verify, as stated in \"Click ad and wait for 15 seconds on ad to Verify.\" However, the ads are delivered by Google, and they

the mechanism requires clicking the ad and waiting for 15 seconds to verify, as stated in \"Click ad and wait for 15 seconds on ad to Verify.\" However, the ads are delivered by Google, and they disappear not only through DNS blocking but also with the AdGuard app on iOS. Therefore, it is impossible to bypass this system, which is a drawback of AdGuard. I understand that addressing issues through DNS is challenging, but is there any way to make it functional with AdGuard for iOS?\r\n> \r\n> Thank you for your help.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jol51rr15ugccos0w8k80o0swcco8o8lt977o3cyr4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2o08l1g80qo0g8ksgossks8o0o8g0w8ltd4zlrbybk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `iOS 18.5`\r\nBrowser: | Safari","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-15T08:42:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Hi. I don't know much of anything about ad blocking. The form I filled out was to the best of my ability. It may contain errors. The situation: I was on Google News (not signed in and never going there again). When I navigated between the business and technology tabs, instead of proceeding to the selected tab, this website popped up. There were no links on either page at the time that I could have hit accidentally to get there as far as I can tell. It happened once and I got aggravated, so I ignored it and clicked onward. The second time it happened, I informed not just AdGuard, but also Bitdefender and Vivaldi. Only AdGuard reached out. I can't reproduce the event. I don't think it's a missed ad; I think it was purposefully injected into the transition between tabs to avoid AdGuard or Vivaldi blocking it. I don't have any clue or ability to figure this situation out, but something like an injection in between two selected webpages is highly suspect. I don't know if it is something AdGuard, Vivaldi, and/or Bitdefender have anything to do with, so no judgment. I enjoy using AdGuard and Vivaldi both. This isn't a complaint in any way. I just wanted to inform everyone that I saw this happen and if it's important, it's here for you to take a look at it. Thank you so much for your help! \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qxojokhhhpwcwwwksgcg40wg4sccww8tvw1q6r75k0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.10\r\nSystem version: | `Android 15`\r\nBrowser: | Vivaldi\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `94.140.14.14`, `94.140.15.15`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `Vivaldi, Bitdefender`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209353/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3072919601","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209353#issuecomment-3072919601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209353","id":3072919601,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM863KQgx","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-15T09:41:12Z","updated_at":"2025-07-15T09:41:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Did you get it in the app `Google News`?
