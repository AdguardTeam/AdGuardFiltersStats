[guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [ ] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [x] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters

`capital.it#@##iubenda-cs-banner`: if you don't reject cookies you can't listen to the webradio, so you can't hide it;\r\n\r\n- Added `deejay.it` and `capital.it` to the existing (trusted-) scriptlets to automatically reject cookies;\r\n- Removed `capital.it` from `#%#//scriptlet('trusted-click-element', '.iubenda-cs-visible .iubenda-cs-accept-btn')`: you don't need to accept cookies, you can reject them;\r\n\r\n- Replaced `capital.it#%#//scriptlet('prevent-element-src-loading', 'script', 'static.chartbeat.com/js/chartbeat_brightcove_plugin.js')` with `redirect=noopjs` so uBO users can take advantage of it;\r\n- Added `googletagmanager.com/gtm.js` exception needed to listen to the webradio.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not

to automatically reject cookies;\r\n- Removed `capital.it` from `#%#//scriptlet('trusted-click-element', '.iubenda-cs-visible .iubenda-cs-accept-btn')`: you don't need to accept cookies, you can reject them;\r\n\r\n- Replaced `capital.it#%#//scriptlet('prevent-element-src-loading', 'script', 'static.chartbeat.com/js/chartbeat_brightcove_plugin.js')` with `redirect=noopjs` so uBO users can

Comment\r\n> Playing video on Crunchyroll is currently not possible unless Adguard is paused (not just disabled).  Just disabling Adguard does not fix the problem.  While Adguard is not paused, video playback will not start.   It will show the loading spinner and never start.  This is somewhat ironic since I pay for the service and won't receive ads even without Adguard.   Disabling Adguard does not fix the problem.\r\n> \r\n> Note:  The \"with Adguard disabled\" pic isn't right for two reasons:\r\n> 1) You can't screenshot the copyrighted video on Windows, so it shows as black.  There is actually a video playing\r\n> 2) Adguard isn't just disabled, it's paused.   Disabling still doesn't work.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot
