[guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [ ] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [x] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters

`capital.it#@##iubenda-cs-banner`: if you don't reject cookies you can't listen to the webradio, so you can't hide it;\r\n\r\n- Added `deejay.it` and `capital.it` to the existing (trusted-) scriptlets to automatically reject cookies;\r\n- Removed `capital.it` from `#%#//scriptlet('trusted-click-element', '.iubenda-cs-visible .iubenda-cs-accept-btn')`: you don't need to accept cookies, you can reject them;\r\n\r\n- Replaced `capital.it#%#//scriptlet('prevent-element-src-loading', 'script', 'static.chartbeat.com/js/chartbeat_brightcove_plugin.js')` with `redirect=noopjs` so uBO users can take advantage of it;\r\n- Added `googletagmanager.com/gtm.js` exception needed to listen to the webradio.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not

to automatically reject cookies;\r\n- Removed `capital.it` from `#%#//scriptlet('trusted-click-element', '.iubenda-cs-visible .iubenda-cs-accept-btn')`: you don't need to accept cookies, you can reject them;\r\n\r\n- Replaced `capital.it#%#//scriptlet('prevent-element-src-loading', 'script', 'static.chartbeat.com/js/chartbeat_brightcove_plugin.js')` with `redirect=noopjs` so uBO users can
