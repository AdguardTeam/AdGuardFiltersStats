Comment\r\n> Не знаю что произошло, ранее реклама везде блокировалась (кроме сайтов Яндекса), на следующий день с включённым AdGuard реклама НЕ блокируется ни в каком браузере. Дело точно не в функции с сетевым WPF фильтром. Вырубил его, чтобы ютуб и прочие забанненые сайты грузились через прокси. Сейчас прокси выключен, так что дело не в нем и ранее с прокси сервером реклама все равно блокировалась \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Comment\r\n> Yes; as soon as i white listed the domain the game properly loaded into GTA Online.  I tried loading into the game several times before i looked to see if the domain was being blocked.  I white listed the sub-domain as soon as i saw that it was, and the game instantly worked; it was like turning on a light switch.\r\n> \r\n> I've played ~5000 hours of GTA, 99% of that is online - on PC.  Whilst the domain might have been in the list a long time, blocking this sub-domain has definitely stopped me from loading into the game.\r\n> \r\n> I've just turned off the white list and game has loaded in even though the domain is now blocked.\r\n> \r\n> Maybe Rockstar required the domain on a specific update earlier this year, maybe they'll require it again.\r\n> \r\n> All i know is that i wasted 20-30 mins of my life trying to load into the game, I missed the start of a playlist, and as soon as i white listed the domain the game properly loaded.  The people i was supposed to play with live in the same part of the world as me and they didn't have an issue at all.  Rockstar services were all fully functional as well.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/p0i5x1z50lc4ws04cs4cc804400ggswgcq90ltjhtk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b4tos6bd380880kswoocwwwow4c4wo895tyrygzvgw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | Game\r\nBrowser: | Game","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2549598348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-12-17T20:49:12Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
