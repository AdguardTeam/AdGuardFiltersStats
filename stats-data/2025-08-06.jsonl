Many months ago, it used to cause a long delay to open Steam but back then this filter was not presented as an option in AdGuard for Windows's Add a filter page, so I didn't report back then\n3. But now the filter is present in the list and enabling it causes the Steam app not able to run\n4. Alternate is to either disable the filter or disable the Filter localhost option in Advanced Settings which would make this filter useless anyway\n5. Either it should be fixed if possible, or the filter should be removed from AdGuard for Windows and other affected AdGuard apps.\n2.

Comment\r\n> I could not open link from official Google Ads mail to open my Google Ads and download my invoice. No settings or filters were possible to include an exception so I had to turn off whole extension. While I wanted to create personal filter, even if that was possible, it's still not correct behavior. Either make exception for such official sites or invent a better system. We are not talking about ads anymore, we are talking about opening links from official emails from important services.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/5fil8012qroks8cswwo4sg4owgogok8ckyir3lt7lk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/gzjybfzaz280ss8cgsgs4gs0sswoo8opwhxg1zdcjk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.127 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 11`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210722/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-08-06T13:06:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Many months ago, it used to cause a long delay to open Steam but back then this filter was not presented as an option in AdGuard for Windows's Add a filter page, so I didn't report back then\n3. But now the filter is present in the list and enabling it causes the Steam app not able to run\n4. Alternate is to either disable the filter or disable the Filter localhost option in Advanced Settings which would make this filter useless anyway\n5. Either it should be fixed if possible, or the filter should be removed from AdGuard for Windows and other affected AdGuard apps.\n2.
