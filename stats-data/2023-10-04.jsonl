Comment\r\nUsername: @kriegaex\r\n> The \"Share\" links on Stack Overflow are not longer working, both on questions and on answers. The filter mistakes them for social media share widgets, which they are not. The links only display a pop-up with a URL to copy.\r\n> \r\n> This happened before on Stack Overflow with AdGuard. It was fixed quickly last time, but maybe it makes sense to explicitly white-list that website for this filter type or be more precise in matching.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/owlf4nfq0g04k0ow4so08o8o4o80gc0did3vog9vdw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.2.168\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList China, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163148/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1746620017","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163148#issuecomment-1746620017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163148","id":1746620017,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85oG05x","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-04T10:46:48Z","updated_at":"2023-10-04T10:46:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kriegaex as I see, the rules apply correctly on this site - they block only social share.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot:</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/33488229/d103c8a4-afb1-4c03-b4f9-9982c7a9ef26)\r\n\r\n</details><br/>\r\n\r\nCould you tell me where exactly do you notice the incorrect blocking in detail?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1746620017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-10-04T10:46:49Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @kriegaex\r\n> The \"Share\" links on Stack Overflow are not longer working, both on questions and on answers. The filter mistakes them for social media share widgets, which they are not. The links only display a pop-up with a URL to copy.\r\n> \r\n> This happened before on Stack Overflow with AdGuard. It was fixed quickly last time, but maybe it makes sense to explicitly white-list that website for this filter type or be more precise in matching.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/owlf4nfq0g04k0ow4so08o8o4o80gc0did3vog9vdw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.2.168\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList China, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163148/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1746696680","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163148#issuecomment-1746696680","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163148","id":1746696680,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85oHHno","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-04T11:37:39Z","updated_at":"2023-10-04T11:37:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Like I said, on the \"Share\" links, e.g. here:\r\n\r\nWell, it is caused by `Fanboy's Annoyances`.
