ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript.

I'd like Adguard to analyze this problem.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/9vix6cahjls0w04cwowoo8wosk4ckgcegtg5uzmxa8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4qzv0ag085us8oswwwc4g8wg4c0s0cgkgp0h488qlw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.3\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11 23H2\r\nBrowser: | Brave\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Browser API**:<br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID, <br>Disable Windows Defender automatic samples submission, <br>Disable WAP Push Message Routing Service<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Cloudflare`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Portuguese\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=Cloudflare)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208128/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2999495917","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208128#issuecomment-2999495917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208128","id":2999495917,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86yyKzt","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-24T09:14:33Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T09:14:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">but it causes error spam at console like this a lot\n\nThat's not a problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2999495917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-24T09:14:35Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> AdGuard is unable to correctly handle Percent-Encoding (e.g., `%=` = `%25`, `&` = `%26`) under certain circumstances.  \r\n> This issue arises when processing specific URLs or URLs that contain Chinese characters.\r\n> \r\n> For example, try searching for **\"伺服器 ithome\"** on `www.google.com`.  \r\n> When opening the ithome website from the search results, the address cannot be entered properly.\r\n> \r\n> **Example URL:**\r\n> - [https://www.google.com/search?q=伺服器+ithome&newwindow=1](https://www.google.com/search?q=伺服器+ithome&newwindow=1)\r\n> -

`www.google.com` via the **AdGuard browser extension** on **MS Edge**, the issue can be quickly resolved.  \r\n> However, since I am using **AdGuard for Windows**, the problem may be related to

I'd like Adguard to analyze this problem.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/9vix6cahjls0w04cwowoo8wosk4ckgcegtg5uzmxa8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4qzv0ag085us8oswwwc4g8wg4c0s0cgkgp0h488qlw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.3\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11 23H2\r\nBrowser: | Brave\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Browser API**:<br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID, <br>Disable Windows Defender automatic samples submission, <br>Disable WAP Push Message Routing Service<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Cloudflare`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Portuguese\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=Cloudflare)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208128/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-24T14:46:14Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
