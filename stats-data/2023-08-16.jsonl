blocking popups with annoyance filters on. \r\n> \r\n> Now it doesn’t work no matter what filters are on.\r\n> \r\n> The attached screenshot is the website that pops up now on about half the clicks of the video player.\r\n> \r\n> Fully updated app and filter list on fully updated iPhone. \r\n> \r\n> I love using AdGuard so I hope they can make my sports watching experience ad free again.\r\n\r\n###
