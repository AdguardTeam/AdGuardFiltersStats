Even on i7 12th generation with SSD problem persist. Occasionally after opening new tab same thing happens. Need to wait for a minute and refresh website again. This happens on every www site.

Меня зовут Иван, прошу разобраться в проблеме или системном сбое, связанном возможно, с неправильной работой расширения: всё было хорошо, но в один момент расширение Ad guard стало блокировать на странице ВК все посты (картинки), а отображение плейлистов вообще пропало. На скриншотах видно, что реклама при включенном Ad guard как бы блокируется, но как-то не так: а при выключенном всё наоборот: появилось отображение постов, плейлистов и появилась реклама! Прошу вас разобраться с этой проблемой!!! Заранее спасибо за понимание!!!\r\n```\r\nUsername: Gureev.05.2001@mail.ru\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/rjyo6vdbwmscck8skok0ook40wwkc0w3bs2f2mx1ok.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/9f9scgtbsb8cgwg4o4008cwgcwc4g0gcbayq0ouo28.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.2.800.27 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Яндекс Браузер\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880)\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nCustom filters: | `Браузерное расширение AdGuard`\r\nFilters last update: | January 16, 2026 at 09:00\r\nOther extensions used: | `Ад Гуард, 360 Total Security.`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.info/settings/import.html?product_type=ext&product_version=5.2.800.27&system_version=Windows+10&manifest_version=3&browser=yandex&browser_detail=Yandex&filters=1.2.3.5.11.17.19.21.23.208.224.255.256.257.259&custom_filters=%25D0%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%2520%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2520AdGuard&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.strip_url=true&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_trackers=true&filters_last_update=2026-01-16T09%3A00%3A32)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3767144889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2026-01-19T08:49:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Да, подскажите, пожалуйста. Я обнаружил, что при включенной настройке (Пользовательские правила) плейлисты и отображение постов (картинок) пропали.

Да, подскажите, пожалуйста. Я обнаружил, что при включенной настройке (Пользовательские правила) плейлисты и отображение постов (картинок) пропали. Но как только я отключил нужные мне Пользовательские правила, снова зашёл в ВК, отображение постов (картинок) и плейлистов тут же появилось!!! объясните, пожалуйста, по какой причине до этого момента пользовательские правила никак не влияли на ВК и его функциональность, то есть работали и продолжали работать, все плейлисты и посты (картинки) отображались, а теперь вдруг что-то пошло не так!!! и пользовательскими правилами стало блокироваться то, что недопустимо для блокировки!!! Эти  Правила нужны в таких сервисах как: Майл. RU расписание ТВ каналов, Майл. RU Почта, и RUTUBE где реклама выскакивает  чуть ли не веде!!!А в итоге блокируется не то что нужно там, где этого совсем не надо, т.е ВК, они нужны, но за последние 1 - 2 дня они т.е (Пользовательские правила) стали работать не должным образом!!! прошу разобраться с этой проблемой: раздел под названием (Пользовательские правила)!!!\r\n```\r\nUsername: Gureev.05.2001@mail.ru\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/rjyo6vdbwmscck8skok0ook40wwkc0w3bs2f2mx1ok.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/ks3ajd37j00sosgwkkscswo88wgwg0w3xqolpr6tqw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.2.800.27 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Яндекс Браузер\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nCustom filters: | `Браузерное расширение AdGuard`\r\nFilters last update: | January 16, 2026 at 09:00\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.info/settings/import.html?product_type=ext&product_version=5.2.800.27&system_version=Windows+10&manifest_version=3&browser=yandex&browser_detail=Yandex&filters=1.2.3.5.11.17.19.21.23.208.224.255.256.257.259&custom_filters=%25D0%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%2520%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2520AdGuard&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.strip_url=true&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_trackers=true&filters_last_update=2026-01-16T09%3A00%3A32)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/223080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/223080/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2026-01-19T09:44:46Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Но как только я отключил нужные мне Пользовательские правила, снова зашёл в ВК, отображение постов (картинок) и плейлистов тут же появилось!!! объясните, пожалуйста, по какой причине до этого момента пользовательские правила никак не влияли на ВК и его функциональность, то есть работали и продолжали работать, все плейлисты и посты (картинки) отображались, а теперь вдруг что-то пошло не так!!! и пользовательскими правилами стало блокироваться то, что недопустимо для блокировки!!! прошу разобраться с этой проблемой: раздел под названием (Пользовательские правила)!!!\r\n```\r\nUsername: Gureev.05.2001@mail.ru\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/q510v4ltwtckw0sg0cckco4ggs808c0pmersxlmow0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/9f9scgtbsb8cgwg4o4008cwgcwc4g0gcbayq0ouo28.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.2.800.27 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Яндекс Браузер\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880)\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nCustom filters: | `Браузерное расширение AdGuard`\r\nFilters last update: | January 16, 2026 at 09:00\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.info/settings/import.html?product_type=ext&product_version=5.2.800.27&system_version=Windows+10&manifest_version=3&browser=yandex&browser_detail=Yandex&filters=1.2.3.5.11.17.19.21.23.208.224.255.256.257.259&custom_filters=%25D0%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%2520%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2520AdGuard&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.strip_url=true&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_trackers=true&filters_last_update=2026-01-16T09%3A00%3A32)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/223078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/223078/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3767380435","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/223078#issuecomment-3767380435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/223078","id":3767380435,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87gjanT","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-19T09:42:14Z","updated_at":"2026-01-19T09:42:14Z","body":"Не повторяется.

Но как только я отключил нужные мне Пользовательские правила, снова зашёл в ВК, отображение постов (картинок) и плейлистов тут же появилось!!! объясните, пожалуйста, по какой причине до этого момента пользовательские правила никак не влияли на ВК и его функциональность, то есть работали и продолжали работать, все плейлисты и посты (картинки) отображались, а теперь вдруг что-то пошло не так!!! и пользовательскими правилами стало блокироваться то, что недопустимо для блокировки!!! прошу разобраться с этой проблемой: раздел под названием (Пользовательские правила)!!!\r\n```\r\nUsername: Gureev.05.2001@mail.ru\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/q510v4ltwtckw0sg0cckco4ggs808c0pmersxlmow0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/9f9scgtbsb8cgwg4o4008cwgcwc4g0gcbayq0ouo28.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.2.800.27 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Яндекс Браузер\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880)\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nCustom filters: | `Браузерное расширение AdGuard`\r\nFilters last update: | January 16, 2026 at 09:00\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.info/settings/import.html?product_type=ext&product_version=5.2.800.27&system_version=Windows+10&manifest_version=3&browser=yandex&browser_detail=Yandex&filters=1.2.3.5.11.17.19.21.23.208.224.255.256.257.259&custom_filters=%25D0%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%2520%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2520AdGuard&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.strip_url=true&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_trackers=true&filters_last_update=2026-01-16T09%3A00%3A32)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/223078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/223078/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2026-01-19T09:29:49Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
