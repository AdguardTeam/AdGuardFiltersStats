I have the same problem with all galleries (bulletin boards) on a site called dcinside. The gallery I specified in the link is just one example.\r\n> \r\n> 2. intermittently, when I try to access, refresh, enter a post/comment, etc., it just loads pointlessly and never completes, as if the browser is lagging.\r\n> \r\n> 3. In that state, I can't select any links, try to refresh again, or even hit back button to go back until I get to the new tab home.\r\n> \r\n> 4. like 'namu wiki', I have a suspicion that the company is intentionally making the site difficult to use if you have adblock enabled.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/npk3eowo1hws8880kw84k4oosw40wo0btj3rewqkjc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/iw5zdzox51k4kgkwco0wwo0g4040k8o5umb8xhphjc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.14\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (30), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://***.d.adguard-dns.com,tls://254ff525.d.adguard-dns.com,https://254ff525.d.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/windows/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>List-KR, <br/>AdGuard Japanese\r\nUserscripts: | https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/List-KR/NamuLink@main/NamuLink.user.js,<br>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/List-KR/microShield@main/microShield.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/lists?id=ftl](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgall.dcinside.com%2Fmgallery%2Fboard%2Flists%3Fid%3Dftl)\r\nOther extensions used: |  Listly/DownThemAll!/Eightify/Gimme Summary/GoFullPage/Image Downloader/ShareGPT/클린디씨/프롬프트 지니/Ahnlab V3","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158328/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1678289389","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158328#issuecomment-1678289389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158328","id":1678289389,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85kCKnt","user":{"login":"115dkk","id":33408534,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDA4NTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33408534?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/115dkk","html_url":"https://github.com/115dkk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/115dkk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/115dkk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/115dkk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/115dkk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/115dkk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/115dkk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/115dkk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/115dkk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/115dkk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-15T01:12:19Z","updated_at":"2023-08-15T01:12:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Did you mean dcinside?\r\n\r\nyes.\r\n\r\n> Please remove all anti-virus programs except Microsoft Defender and reboot your computer.\r\n\r\nI'll give it a try by this evening.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1678289389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-15T01:12:20Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Мы все под Богом ходим и ответим за все свои слова и дела и мысли! Объясните Анне-что мат это грех, плата за грех смерть, пусть покается, обратится к Богу, самой очень трудно избавиться от всех пороков!  Мат разрушает её ДНК, когда БОмжи матерятся-это плохо, а когда медик, будущий адвокат матерится, снимает видео на фоне мата -это очень печально для неё и её будущего и её вечности!   Это не сочетается с девушкой из высшего общества, которой она хочет стать! Святость и чистота должна быть присуща девушке, будущей матери!  ИИсус любит и её и вас, спасибо заранее, что объясните Анне, что мудрые идут прямым путем! Путь грешников -скользкий и нечестивый не поживет на земле!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/nqionpqzf7kwwsco8c8s0ccwks00ccciql4wnbivns.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nOther extensions used: | Девушка сняла Видео на фоне матной речи мужчины","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159190/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-15T09:38:32Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Мы все под Богом ходим и ответим за все свои слова и дела и мысли! Объясните Анне-что мат это грех, плата за грех смерть, пусть покается, обратится к Богу, самой очень трудно избавиться от всех пороков!  Мат разрушает её ДНК, когда БОмжи матерятся-это плохо, а когда медик, будущий адвокат матерится, снимает видео на фоне мата -это очень печально для неё и её будущего и её вечности!   Это не сочетается с девушкой из высшего общества, которой она хочет стать! Святость и чистота должна быть присуща девушке, будущей матери!  ИИсус любит и её и вас, спасибо заранее, что объясните Анне, что мудрые идут прямым путем!
