Don't you too often ignore comments which sometimes are important? Plus, regarding `##button.MuiButtonBase-root.MuiIconButton-root:has(> svg[data-testid=\"ShareRoundedIcon\"])` where's the need for `:has()`? Do not use `:has()` if the end result is the same without it.\n\n@Alex-302 I wonder about our policy for URL-copy buttons. I haven't regarded them as share-buttons, in fact, here the rest of buttons are hidden by `##.react-share__ShareButton`. I'm unsure if these are what all the user expect Social lists to block. Though user can copy the url from the address bar, they are utility similar to go-to-top buttons. Addressing \ncopy buttons requires many more additional rules which bloats our list.\n\n@AdamWr IIRC, several years ago you didn't actively hide copy buttons and sometimes even exempted, but nowadays tend to hide? Was there a change in your mind or in our policy?\n\nPersonally, I think we don't have to actively block them, unless, rule-wise, it's much easier to hide together when we target SNS buttons.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2785184099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-08T04:21:03Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

[@AdamWr](https://github.com/AdamWr) IIRC, several years ago you didn't actively hide copy buttons and sometimes even exempted (I mean `:not` alike and not `#@#`), but nowadays tend to hide? Was there a change in your mind or in our policy?\n\nThat's true, because I thought that it should not be hidden, but as I recall, I was told that we can hide these buttons if it's part of the element with share buttons. I guess that we do not need to do that if it's just separate button with different parent element/class/id.
