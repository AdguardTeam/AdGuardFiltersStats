Don't you too often ignore comments which sometimes are important? Plus, regarding `##button.MuiButtonBase-root.MuiIconButton-root:has(> svg[data-testid=\"ShareRoundedIcon\"])` where's the need for `:has()`? Do not use `:has()` if the end result is the same without it.\n\n@Alex-302 I wonder about our policy for URL-copy buttons. I haven't regarded them as share-buttons, in fact, here the rest of buttons are hidden by `##.react-share__ShareButton`. I'm unsure if these are what all the user expect Social lists to block. Though user can copy the url from the address bar, they are utility similar to go-to-top buttons. Addressing \ncopy buttons requires many more additional rules which bloats our list.\n\n@AdamWr IIRC, several years ago you didn't actively hide copy buttons and sometimes even exempted, but nowadays tend to hide? Was there a change in your mind or in our policy?\n\nPersonally, I think we don't have to actively block them, unless, rule-wise, it's much easier to hide together when we target SNS buttons.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2785184099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-08T04:21:03Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

[@AdamWr](https://github.com/AdamWr) IIRC, several years ago you didn't actively hide copy buttons and sometimes even exempted (I mean `:not` alike and not `#@#`), but nowadays tend to hide? Was there a change in your mind or in our policy?\n\nThat's true, because I thought that it should not be hidden, but as I recall, I was told that we can hide these buttons if it's part of the element with share buttons. I guess that we do not need to do that if it's just separate button with different parent element/class/id.

When Firefox released version 136, I updated it and opened the website https://ani.gamer.com.tw/ (if you want to watch the video, you need an ip from tw or hk) as usual, but I couldn't watch it. If you are not a member of the website, you need to watch a 30-second ad. It is normal that this ad cannot be blocked by the plug-in. I found that I couldn't load videos or even ads after turning on the plugin. I had to turn off the plugin to watch it normally as usual: watch a 30-second ad before starting the video, but now the ads have become very weird. In the past, they were just animated ads, but now there are all kinds of VPN ads.

The extension was able to block all of them until recently. The URL I've included in this report is for the show I happened to be watching when I encountered this issue because the generic netflix.com and netflix.com/browse pages don't have the issue, but I assume it's not specific to this one show.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/csuzu00jy1w0sk8sw0ggosgkskgs88kkzijxl04l00.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.49 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Ubuntu\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Estonian List\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Simple Tab Groups, Enhancer for Youtube, Dark Reader","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201253/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-08T12:44:00Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Although I have AdGuard for Safari installed, and it's consistently prevented ads from popping up before, it's no longer working. I use our family computer so I'm not sure if somebody changed something thats affected it, but I deleted and reinstalled it, and only checked the starting filters, so I don't know if this really isn't possible to prevent anymore or if I'm missing something. Maybe Hulu updated their user agreement and that's changed its something, but I also have this installed on Windows and it works fine, last I checked.\r\nUsername: `@sendhelpthanks`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ka0u6nnpq1w0sc0g0o4gckk8s0owo4oangi67wknog.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.20\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200413/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2786308541","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200413#issuecomment-2786308541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200413","id":2786308541,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86mE7G9","user":{"login":"jordansworld","id":180710643,"node_id":"U_kgDOCsVs8w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180710643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld","html_url":"https://github.com/jordansworld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-08T12:40:43Z","updated_at":"2025-04-08T12:40:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Alex-302 can be closed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2786308541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-08T12:40:44Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

description\n\nThis commit added generic rules.
