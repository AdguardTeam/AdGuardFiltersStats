ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript.

It can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> Saving memory feature of your web browser or sleep feature of your operating system can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n> In this case, please re-enable AdGuard's filtering by toggling the protection toggle.\n> Following the instructions can be needed.\n\n### The instructions\n1.

That's a crucial detail. Here's the updated GitHub issue:\r\n> Title\r\n> Endless login loop caused by browser extension conflict\r\n> Description\r\n> Bug Report\r\n> I'm experiencing an endless login loop on the Poppy AI web application that appears to be caused by a browser extension conflict. After successfully logging in and viewing my projects, clicking on any project redirects me back to the login page. The issue resolves completely when all browser extensions are disabled.\r\n> Steps to Reproduce\r\n> \r\n> Navigate to https://app.getpoppy.ai/login with extensions enabled\r\n> Click \"Continue with Google\" or enter email credentials\r\n> Successfully login and reach the boards page (https://app.getpoppy.ai/boards)\r\n> Click on any project/board from the list\r\n> Get redirected back to https://app.getpoppy.ai/login\r\n> \r\n> Workaround Found\r\n> The issue is completely resolved when I disable all browser extensions in Edge settings. This indicates an extension compatibility issue rather than a core application bug.\r\n> Expected Behavior\r\n> After clicking on a project, I should be taken to that project's workspace/dashboard regardless of enabled extensions.\r\n> Actual Behavior\r\n> Clicking on any project immediately redirects me back to the login page when extensions are enabled, but works perfectly when extensions are disabled.\r\n> Environment\r\n> \r\n> Browser: Microsoft Edge (Version [your version])\r\n> OS: Windows [your version]\r\n> URL: https://app.getpoppy.ai/\r\n> Extensions: Microsoft Edge Unminification Extension v135.0.3176.0 - ID: cgjgjfacjflmgphhhepmbhhbgjieaecn, Notebook LM v1.0.0.3 - ID: dgenbagabmmjpfjlbcnnlmpopipdapjo, Hunter - Email Finder Extension v3.1.3 - ID: dmgcgojogkfomifjfeeafajhmgilkofk, Tokmate v1.0.11 - ID: eblnpfeekmoledbhianpljdjbemkblim, Titans Quick View - Amazon Niche Finder v8.54 - ID: eefljgmhgaidffapnppcmmafobefjece, ChatGPT search v1.11 - ID: ejcfepkfckglbgocfkanmcdngdijcgld, FrankerFaceZ v4.77.11.2 - ID: fadndhdgpmmaapbmfcknlfgcflmmmieb, Meta Pixel Helper v3.0.7 - ID: fdgfkebogiimcoedlicjlajpkdmockpc, Google Docs Offline v1.94.1 - ID: ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi, WebSync full site importer for NotebookLM v1.1.3.25608 - ID: hjoonjdnhagnpfgifhjolheimamcafok, addy.io - Anonymous Email Forwarding v2.3.7 - ID: iadbdpnoknmbdeolbapdackdcogdmjpe, Mega Messenger v3.0.4 - ID: iddifpoaoiehbfgifechnhameaahpnbi, NotebookLM - Youtube Link (Source) Automator v0.2 - ID: idkdddfdfhlgjleoieidjhmgmopacdli, Chrome Remote Desktop v2.1 - ID: inomeogfingihgjfjlpeplalcfajhgai, Bitwarden Password Manager v2025.7.0 - ID: jbkfoedolllekgbhcbcoahefnbanhhlh, Edge relevant text changes v1.2.1 - ID: jmjflgjpcpepeafmmgdpfkogkghcpiha, Microsoft Power Automate v2.55.0.31 - ID: kagpabjoboikccfdghpdlaaopmgpgfdc, Microsoft Edge DevTools Enhancements v113.0.1765.0 - ID: kfbdpdaobnofkbopebjglnaadopfikhh, AutoBuzz AI v1.0.3 - ID: lipommpcimhmhdnfbbpiggajcooldoig, GoBeaver AI v3.0 - ID: mchgbjjkiggignhnjedcgfmkjfbafafa, EverBee - Find Best Selling Products on Etsy v9.1.11.4 - ID: oeicpkgdngoghobnbjngekclpcmpgpij, AdGuard AdBlocker v5.1.102 - ID: pdffkfellgipmhklpdmokmckkkfcopbh, Detailed SEO Extension v2.2.4 - ID: pfjdepjjfjjahkjfpkcgfmfhmnakjfba\r\n> \r\n> Likely Culprits\r\n> Based on the extension list, potential candidates that might interfere with authentication flows:\r\n> \r\n> AdGuard AdBlocker (may block auth-related requests)\r\n> Meta Pixel Helper (might interfere with tracking/analytics)\r\n> Hunter - Email Finder Extension (could interfere with email-based auth)\r\n> Various content modification extensions\r\n> \r\n> Technical Notes\r\n> This suggests an extension is either:\r\n> \r\n> Blocking authentication cookies or session tokens\r\n> Interfering with redirect flows\r\n> Modifying authentication-related JavaScript/requests\r\n> Conflicting with the application's session management\r\n> \r\n> Request\r\n> Could you provide guidance on which types of extensions commonly conflict with your authentication system?

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://paramountplus.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fparamountplus.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> No way to submit ticket without pictures and the issue only happens on roku, which I didn't take pictures of, but after much troubleshooting i've narrowed it down to this dns blocking content on the paramount plus app via roku. Plays content immediately when changing wifi to my phone hot spot or changing this dns on my router, but they have changed something on their side that this dns blocks and it is preventing content from loading. It's some kind of ad that plays before their content, even with paid subscriptions. Please look into this so I can keep using this dns. This issue is also all over reddit, but not necessarily with your DNS. I also tried numerous other dns options that block ads and none allowed this content to play. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/78qih2ct9c0040800ogo8swogsosw48d7sf6mewaag.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/sp6nlpq7p40k0sk4w4s88wcggsw040gfyw76xavxtk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Asus AC2900`\r\nBrowser: | n/a","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3192002795","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678#issuecomment-3192002795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678","id":3192002795,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86-Qhjr","user":{"login":"jo2dan94","id":225954378,"node_id":"U_kgDODXfKSg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225954378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94","html_url":"https://github.com/jo2dan94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-15T15:56:39Z","updated_at":"2025-08-15T15:56:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Alex-302 bad news my roku is broke... idk what happened it worked a couple months ago.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://paramountplus.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fparamountplus.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> No way to submit ticket without pictures and the issue only happens on roku, which I didn't take pictures of, but after much troubleshooting i've narrowed it down to this dns blocking content on the paramount plus app via roku. Plays content immediately when changing wifi to my phone hot spot or changing this dns on my router, but they have changed something on their side that this dns blocks and it is preventing content from loading. It's some kind of ad that plays before their content, even with paid subscriptions. Please look into this so I can keep using this dns. This issue is also all over reddit, but not necessarily with your DNS. I also tried numerous other dns options that block ads and none allowed this content to play. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/78qih2ct9c0040800ogo8swogsosw48d7sf6mewaag.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/sp6nlpq7p40k0sk4w4s88wcggsw040gfyw76xavxtk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Asus AC2900`\r\nBrowser: | n/a","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3191957362","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678#issuecomment-3191957362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678","id":3191957362,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86-QWdy","user":{"login":"jo2dan94","id":225954378,"node_id":"U_kgDODXfKSg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225954378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94","html_url":"https://github.com/jo2dan94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-15T15:48:10Z","updated_at":"2025-08-15T15:48:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Alex-302 testing rn on my roku","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3191957362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-08-15T15:48:12Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

It's some kind of ad that plays before their content, even with paid subscriptions. Please look into this so I can keep using this dns. This issue is also all over reddit, but not necessarily with your DNS. I also tried numerous other dns options that block ads and none allowed this content to play.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://paramountplus.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fparamountplus.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> No way to submit ticket without pictures and the issue only happens on roku, which I didn't take pictures of, but after much troubleshooting i've narrowed it down to this dns blocking content on the paramount plus app via roku. Plays content immediately when changing wifi to my phone hot spot or changing this dns on my router, but they have changed something on their side that this dns blocks and it is preventing content from loading. It's some kind of ad that plays before their content, even with paid subscriptions. Please look into this so I can keep using this dns. This issue is also all over reddit, but not necessarily with your DNS. I also tried numerous other dns options that block ads and none allowed this content to play. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/78qih2ct9c0040800ogo8swogsosw48d7sf6mewaag.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/sp6nlpq7p40k0sk4w4s88wcggsw040gfyw76xavxtk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Asus AC2900`\r\nBrowser: | n/a","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3192002795","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678#issuecomment-3192002795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678","id":3192002795,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86-Qhjr","user":{"login":"jo2dan94","id":225954378,"node_id":"U_kgDODXfKSg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225954378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94","html_url":"https://github.com/jo2dan94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jo2dan94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-15T15:56:39Z","updated_at":"2025-08-15T15:56:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Alex-302 bad news my roku is broke... idk what happened it worked a couple months ago.
