YouTube, but in China, so it's a Chinese site, and I used your plug-in, the edge browser version, and recently it couldn't block this kind of AD, and the AD appeared in the recommended position on the front page, in one of the six recommended positions on the front page, but the position was not fixed, sometimes it didn't appear, When troubleshooting this vulnerability, you should use the IP address in mainland China, I hope you and your team can solve this problem, these ads are really uncomfortable, thank you very much, \r\n> 这是一个视频网站，就像YouTube一样，不过是在中国，所以他是一个中文网站，我使用了你们的插件，edge浏览器版本，最近他无法拦截这种广告，广告出现于首页头版推荐的位置，在头版推荐的六个位置之中出现，但位置不是固定的，有时不会出现，在排查这个漏洞时，您应该使用中国大陆的IP地址，我希望您和您的团队能解决这个问题，这些广告真的令人不适，非常感谢\r\n\r\n###
