Open the link https://www.20min.ch/fr/video/on-va-peut-etre-jouer-contre-le-real-qui-sait-810526269082 (can be reproduced with other videos too). - You will see a video with a Play button.\r\n> 2. Click on the Play button. - The video will be played normally. \r\n> 3. Click on the Video button in the left upper corner of the screen and choose a different or the same video on the page. - The Play button will not be shown, and the video cannot be run. \r\n> \r\n> With AdGuard turned off, videos are starting to play automatically, without clicking on the Play button. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/rt7scdx4lv4og8ww8wowgk4k4oc0kg01kryp64bx38.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b1ce0j7145k44k4c08o4gks8gogo0ss2e6rqugy615.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mq8jv3w0ozk0okos8w8kwwo8c4ok0g0hmafyufl9rc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.14\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS doh`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard French\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant, AdGuard Extra","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157906/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1660173839","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157906#issuecomment-1660173839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157906","id":1660173839,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85i9D4P","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-01T12:04:03Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T12:04:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Fixed, filters update should be available in 1-2 hours.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1660173839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-01T12:04:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Hello again! I tried it again today and the issue is back. Custom filter in your previous comment doesn't fix it. \r\nI also have Adguard Desktop installed on my PC (not actively using it). With ADG desktop, the adblocker detected message comes up after like 2 seconds. \r\nIf logs like HAR can be recorded via ADG desktop, then let me know how because pressing F12 on browsers shows the paused in debugger thing that I shared in one of my previous comments. \r\nI see that there's an \"Enable HAR writing\" option in ADG desktop's advanced settings. If I enable that, then at which location that file would be saved?
