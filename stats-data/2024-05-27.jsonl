The dark mode and images are back now. Thank you for the solution.\n\n99% of the ads are blocked. The only exception being the grey ad area that can be seen near the top of the screenshot; where the ad image will not loaded but the ad text is still visible. These also go away if I swipe right and left to maneuver between different parts of the app.\n\nAs the issue is mostly resolved, I'm just curious about the reason behind this. Wouldn't the app have to break entirely if I'm having HTTPS problems? Then the rest of the web page is just falling back to HTTP then? What does HTTPS have to do with in-app dark mode and news images?

But my observation is that I am having great ad blocking per se using the current configuration. As you can see in the screenshots, I see no ads using the given settings. However, my issues were that:\n\n- News images are being blocked; but not the web pages themselves.\n- Dark mode is being ignored.\n- The NAVER app detects the Adguard CA certificate and gives me a warning, even though I installed the Adguard CA certificate.\n\nIf this was a system level issue, I would expect that the HTTPS filtering break the app entirely. However, since the ads are being blocked well but some user settings for the website being blocked as collateral, I assumed that this was an issue caused by some overzealous filters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2133028905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-27T09:12:06Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
