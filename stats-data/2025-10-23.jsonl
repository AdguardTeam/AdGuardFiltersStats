Comment\r\n> Following the issue linked below, it appears that several URLs important to online merchants are being blocked as advertisements [issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214522)\r\n> \r\n> The URLs being blocked, such as\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Common-Script/PRODUCTION/alphacore_alpha_data.js?\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Upsell-Script/PRODUCTION/alpha-upsell-shadow-bundle.js?\r\n> - and other URLs matching the static.alphwidget.com^ pattern\r\n> \r\n> are not harmful resources. These scripts provide useful information to web users, such as displaying product reviews or recommending similar items. They display content that the page administrator (the online seller) intends to show.\r\n> \r\n> Because of this, it seems the content provided by these links is not harmful advertising.  As a user, I am personally experiencing difficulties, especially when I try to view product reviews. \r\n> \r\n> I do not want to go through the inconvenience of having to disable Adblock, which is supposed to block harmful ads, just to shop online. \r\n> \r\n> I am reporting this because I visited a shopping site I frequently use and noticed things were different from usual. \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for creating and maintaining a wonderful product like Adblock. Best of luck.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @timothy-jeong\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/bsstr5uekr4888scoco8ko8cwsswc0c2b6lzdclxs8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/ojmvuqsvglwoss8wc0kogog4csw88gc2h3r1fqq5rw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/afrg7l1ix40g0ckg8c0gwgs0sw0goscclaop7bj5xs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/26j08xt0jb34kocsgsscss4s0wkcog8lj57of9ptdc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.17.3\r\nSystem version: | `macOS Sonoma, 14.0, Apple M2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `INISAFE SmartManagerEX, INISAFE CrossWeb EX, TouchEn PC`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=mac&product_version=2.17.3&system_version=macOS+Sonoma%2C+14.0%2C+Apple+M2&browser=chrome&filters=2&dns.enabled=false&browsing_security.enabled=false&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"assignee":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-23T07:25:57Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Common-Script/PRODUCTION/alphacore_alpha_data.js?\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Upsell-Script/PRODUCTION/alpha-upsell-shadow-bundle.js?\r\n> - and other URLs matching the static.alphwidget.com^ pattern\r\n> \r\n> are not harmful resources. These scripts provide useful information to web users, such as displaying product reviews or recommending similar items. They display content that the page administrator (the online seller) intends to show.\r\n> \r\n> Because of this, it seems the content provided by these links is not harmful advertising.  As a user, I am personally experiencing difficulties, especially when I try to view product reviews. \r\n> \r\n> I do not want to go through the inconvenience of having to disable Adblock, which is supposed to block harmful ads, just to shop online. \r\n> \r\n> I am reporting this because I visited a shopping site I frequently use and noticed things were different from usual. \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for creating and maintaining a wonderful product like Adblock. Best of luck.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @timothy-jeong\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/bsstr5uekr4888scoco8ko8cwsswc0c2b6lzdclxs8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/ojmvuqsvglwoss8wc0kogog4csw88gc2h3r1fqq5rw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/afrg7l1ix40g0ckg8c0gwgs0sw0goscclaop7bj5xs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/26j08xt0jb34kocsgsscss4s0wkcog8lj57of9ptdc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.17.3\r\nSystem version: | `macOS Sonoma, 14.0, Apple M2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `INISAFE SmartManagerEX, INISAFE CrossWeb EX, TouchEn PC`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=mac&product_version=2.17.3&system_version=macOS+Sonoma%2C+14.0%2C+Apple+M2&browser=chrome&filters=2&dns.enabled=false&browsing_security.enabled=false&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"label":{"id":762661226,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NjI2NjEyMjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/N:%20AdGuard%20for%20Mac","name":"N: AdGuard for Mac","color":"a64d79","default":false,"description":null},"labels":[{"id":252425980,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTI0MjU5ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/T:%20Incorrect%20Blocking","name":"T: Incorrect Blocking","color":"ff0000","default":false,"description":null},{"id":745624291,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NDU2MjQyOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/P1:%20Critical","name":"P1: Critical","color":"930000","default":false,"description":null},{"id":762659576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NjI2NTk1NzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/A:%20In%20progress","name":"A: In progress","color":"339966","default":false,"description":"Work on the issue is in progress"},{"id":762661226,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NjI2NjEyMjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/N:%20AdGuard%20for%20Mac","name":"N: AdGuard for Mac","color":"a64d79","default":false,"description":null}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-23T07:25:44Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Following the issue linked below, it appears that several URLs important to online merchants are being blocked as advertisements [issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214522)\r\n> \r\n> The URLs being blocked, such as\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Common-Script/PRODUCTION/alphacore_alpha_data.js?\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Upsell-Script/PRODUCTION/alpha-upsell-shadow-bundle.js?\r\n> - and other URLs matching the static.alphwidget.com^ pattern\r\n> \r\n> are not harmful resources. These scripts provide useful information to web users, such as displaying product reviews or recommending similar items.

Comment\r\n> Following the issue linked below, it appears that several URLs important to online merchants are being blocked as advertisements [issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214522)\r\n> \r\n> The URLs being blocked, such as\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Common-Script/PRODUCTION/alphacore_alpha_data.js?\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Upsell-Script/PRODUCTION/alpha-upsell-shadow-bundle.js?\r\n> - and other URLs matching the static.alphwidget.com^ pattern\r\n> \r\n> are not harmful resources. These scripts provide useful information to web users, such as displaying product reviews or recommending similar items. They display content that the page administrator (the online seller) intends to show.\r\n> \r\n> Because of this, it seems the content provided by these links is not harmful advertising.  As a user, I am personally experiencing difficulties, especially when I try to view product reviews. \r\n> \r\n> I do not want to go through the inconvenience of having to disable Adblock, which is supposed to block harmful ads, just to shop online. \r\n> \r\n> I am reporting this because I visited a shopping site I frequently use and noticed things were different from usual. \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for creating and maintaining a wonderful product like Adblock. Best of luck.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @timothy-jeong\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/bsstr5uekr4888scoco8ko8cwsswc0c2b6lzdclxs8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/ojmvuqsvglwoss8wc0kogog4csw88gc2h3r1fqq5rw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/afrg7l1ix40g0ckg8c0gwgs0sw0goscclaop7bj5xs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/26j08xt0jb34kocsgsscss4s0wkcog8lj57of9ptdc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.17.3\r\nSystem version: | `macOS Sonoma, 14.0, Apple M2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `INISAFE SmartManagerEX, INISAFE CrossWeb EX, TouchEn PC`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=mac&product_version=2.17.3&system_version=macOS+Sonoma%2C+14.0%2C+Apple+M2&browser=chrome&filters=2&dns.enabled=false&browsing_security.enabled=false&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-23T07:10:11Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Following the issue linked below, it appears that several URLs important to online merchants are being blocked as advertisements [issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214522)\r\n> \r\n> The URLs being blocked, such as\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Common-Script/PRODUCTION/alphacore_alpha_data.js?\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Upsell-Script/PRODUCTION/alpha-upsell-shadow-bundle.js?\r\n> - and other URLs matching the static.alphwidget.com^ pattern\r\n> \r\n> are not harmful resources. These scripts provide useful information to web users, such as displaying product reviews or recommending similar items. They display content that the page administrator (the online seller) intends to show.\r\n> \r\n> Because of this, it seems the content provided by these links is not harmful advertising.  As a user, I am personally experiencing difficulties, especially when I try to view product reviews. \r\n> \r\n> I do not want to go through the inconvenience of having to disable Adblock, which is supposed to block harmful ads, just to shop online. \r\n> \r\n> I am reporting this because I visited a shopping site I frequently use and noticed things were different from usual. \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for creating and maintaining a wonderful product like Adblock. Best of luck.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @timothy-jeong\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/bsstr5uekr4888scoco8ko8cwsswc0c2b6lzdclxs8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/ojmvuqsvglwoss8wc0kogog4csw88gc2h3r1fqq5rw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/afrg7l1ix40g0ckg8c0gwgs0sw0goscclaop7bj5xs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/26j08xt0jb34kocsgsscss4s0wkcog8lj57of9ptdc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.17.3\r\nSystem version: | `macOS Sonoma, 14.0, Apple M2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `INISAFE SmartManagerEX, INISAFE CrossWeb EX, TouchEn PC`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=mac&product_version=2.17.3&system_version=macOS+Sonoma%2C+14.0%2C+Apple+M2&browser=chrome&filters=2&dns.enabled=false&browsing_security.enabled=false&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3435613410","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069#issuecomment-3435613410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069","id":3435613410,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87Mx0zi","user":{"login":"timothy-jeong","id":53824764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODI0NzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53824764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong","html_url":"https://github.com/timothy-jeong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-23T07:55:53Z","updated_at":"2025-10-23T07:55:53Z","body":"@zloydenHi!\nThank you for replying and Yes, I'll try the user rules and report back","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3435613410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-23T07:55:53Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Following the issue linked below, it appears that several URLs important to online merchants are being blocked as advertisements [issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214522)\r\n> \r\n> The URLs being blocked, such as\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Common-Script/PRODUCTION/alphacore_alpha_data.js?\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Upsell-Script/PRODUCTION/alpha-upsell-shadow-bundle.js?\r\n> - and other URLs matching the static.alphwidget.com^ pattern\r\n> \r\n> are not harmful resources. These scripts provide useful information to web users, such as displaying product reviews or recommending similar items.

Comment\r\n> Following the issue linked below, it appears that several URLs important to online merchants are being blocked as advertisements [issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214522)\r\n> \r\n> The URLs being blocked, such as\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Common-Script/PRODUCTION/alphacore_alpha_data.js?\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Upsell-Script/PRODUCTION/alpha-upsell-shadow-bundle.js?\r\n> - and other URLs matching the static.alphwidget.com^ pattern\r\n> \r\n> are not harmful resources. These scripts provide useful information to web users, such as displaying product reviews or recommending similar items. They display content that the page administrator (the online seller) intends to show.\r\n> \r\n> Because of this, it seems the content provided by these links is not harmful advertising.  As a user, I am personally experiencing difficulties, especially when I try to view product reviews. \r\n> \r\n> I do not want to go through the inconvenience of having to disable Adblock, which is supposed to block harmful ads, just to shop online. \r\n> \r\n> I am reporting this because I visited a shopping site I frequently use and noticed things were different from usual. \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for creating and maintaining a wonderful product like Adblock. Best of luck.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @timothy-jeong\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/bsstr5uekr4888scoco8ko8cwsswc0c2b6lzdclxs8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/ojmvuqsvglwoss8wc0kogog4csw88gc2h3r1fqq5rw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/afrg7l1ix40g0ckg8c0gwgs0sw0goscclaop7bj5xs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/26j08xt0jb34kocsgsscss4s0wkcog8lj57of9ptdc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.17.3\r\nSystem version: | `macOS Sonoma, 14.0, Apple M2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `INISAFE SmartManagerEX, INISAFE CrossWeb EX, TouchEn PC`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=mac&product_version=2.17.3&system_version=macOS+Sonoma%2C+14.0%2C+Apple+M2&browser=chrome&filters=2&dns.enabled=false&browsing_security.enabled=false&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3435729006","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069#issuecomment-3435729006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069","id":3435729006,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87MyRBu","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-23T08:29:31Z","updated_at":"2025-10-23T08:29:31Z","body":"Got it.

Comment\r\n> Following the issue linked below, it appears that several URLs important to online merchants are being blocked as advertisements [issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214522)\r\n> \r\n> The URLs being blocked, such as\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Common-Script/PRODUCTION/alphacore_alpha_data.js?\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Upsell-Script/PRODUCTION/alpha-upsell-shadow-bundle.js?\r\n> - and other URLs matching the static.alphwidget.com^ pattern\r\n> \r\n> are not harmful resources. These scripts provide useful information to web users, such as displaying product reviews or recommending similar items. They display content that the page administrator (the online seller) intends to show.\r\n> \r\n> Because of this, it seems the content provided by these links is not harmful advertising.  As a user, I am personally experiencing difficulties, especially when I try to view product reviews. \r\n> \r\n> I do not want to go through the inconvenience of having to disable Adblock, which is supposed to block harmful ads, just to shop online. \r\n> \r\n> I am reporting this because I visited a shopping site I frequently use and noticed things were different from usual. \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for creating and maintaining a wonderful product like Adblock. Best of luck.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @timothy-jeong\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/bsstr5uekr4888scoco8ko8cwsswc0c2b6lzdclxs8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/ojmvuqsvglwoss8wc0kogog4csw88gc2h3r1fqq5rw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/afrg7l1ix40g0ckg8c0gwgs0sw0goscclaop7bj5xs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/26j08xt0jb34kocsgsscss4s0wkcog8lj57of9ptdc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.17.3\r\nSystem version: | `macOS Sonoma, 14.0, Apple M2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `INISAFE SmartManagerEX, INISAFE CrossWeb EX, TouchEn PC`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=mac&product_version=2.17.3&system_version=macOS+Sonoma%2C+14.0%2C+Apple+M2&browser=chrome&filters=2&dns.enabled=false&browsing_security.enabled=false&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3435674267","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069#issuecomment-3435674267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069","id":3435674267,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87MyDqb","user":{"login":"timothy-jeong","id":53824764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODI0NzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53824764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong","html_url":"https://github.com/timothy-jeong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-23T08:14:10Z","updated_at":"2025-10-23T08:14:10Z","body":"I tested the user rule suggested:\n\n<details>\n<summary>User Rule Tested</summary>\n\n<img width=\"685\" height=\"625\" alt=\"User Rule\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52842c34-e524-4827-8d1f-dba044e15f88\" />\n</details>\n\nAfter applying this rule, the results seem to be inconsistent.\n\nthe review information appears correctly (even with Adblock on), as seen in this \"success\" screenshot:\n\n<details>\n<summary>Screenshot: Success (Reviews display correctly)</summary>\n\n<img width=\"1331\" height=\"1057\" alt=\"Reviews working\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1705130-99fd-435a-aa94-6c396e9f7a66\" />\n</details>\n\nHowever, at the same times, the **Related Products** information still fails to display, even with the same user rule active.

Comment\r\n> Following the issue linked below, it appears that several URLs important to online merchants are being blocked as advertisements [issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214522)\r\n> \r\n> The URLs being blocked, such as\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Common-Script/PRODUCTION/alphacore_alpha_data.js?\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Upsell-Script/PRODUCTION/alpha-upsell-shadow-bundle.js?\r\n> - and other URLs matching the static.alphwidget.com^ pattern\r\n> \r\n> are not harmful resources. These scripts provide useful information to web users, such as displaying product reviews or recommending similar items. They display content that the page administrator (the online seller) intends to show.\r\n> \r\n> Because of this, it seems the content provided by these links is not harmful advertising.  As a user, I am personally experiencing difficulties, especially when I try to view product reviews. \r\n> \r\n> I do not want to go through the inconvenience of having to disable Adblock, which is supposed to block harmful ads, just to shop online. \r\n> \r\n> I am reporting this because I visited a shopping site I frequently use and noticed things were different from usual. \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for creating and maintaining a wonderful product like Adblock. Best of luck.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @timothy-jeong\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/bsstr5uekr4888scoco8ko8cwsswc0c2b6lzdclxs8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/ojmvuqsvglwoss8wc0kogog4csw88gc2h3r1fqq5rw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/afrg7l1ix40g0ckg8c0gwgs0sw0goscclaop7bj5xs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/26j08xt0jb34kocsgsscss4s0wkcog8lj57of9ptdc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.17.3\r\nSystem version: | `macOS Sonoma, 14.0, Apple M2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `INISAFE SmartManagerEX, INISAFE CrossWeb EX, TouchEn PC`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=mac&product_version=2.17.3&system_version=macOS+Sonoma%2C+14.0%2C+Apple+M2&browser=chrome&filters=2&dns.enabled=false&browsing_security.enabled=false&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3435853455","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069#issuecomment-3435853455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069","id":3435853455,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87MyvaP","user":{"login":"timothy-jeong","id":53824764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODI0NzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53824764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong","html_url":"https://github.com/timothy-jeong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-23T09:03:54Z","updated_at":"2025-10-23T09:03:54Z","body":"After I fix user rule as suggested, nuldam.com still display review UI but not for related `related products`.\nThis is the link I visited: [LINK](https://nuldam.com/product/%EB%9A%B1%EC%B9%B4%EB%A1%B1-%ED%94%8C%EB%A0%88%EC%9D%B4%EB%B2%84%ED%99%A9%EC%B9%98%EC%A6%88-%EB%A7%A4%EB%8B%88%EC%95%84%EC%B4%88%EC%BD%94%ED%99%80%EB%A6%AD-44%EA%B5%AC/617/category/1/display/15/?icid=MAIN.product_listmain_14)\n\nThe `related products` at the end of the page are still invisible.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Reviews are visible (Success)</summary>\n\n<img width=\"1150\" height=\"1093\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a99e33a6-5e00-4430-9249-ef08c2287555\" />\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Related products are invisible (Failure)</summary>\n\n<img width=\"1037\" height=\"1094\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e26354fb-38b8-411b-97c4-dcb1df0c0d93\" />\n\n</details>\n\nThank you for your continued help on this issue!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3435853455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-23T09:03:54Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Following the issue linked below, it appears that several URLs important to online merchants are being blocked as advertisements [issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214522)\r\n> \r\n> The URLs being blocked, such as\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Common-Script/PRODUCTION/alphacore_alpha_data.js?\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Upsell-Script/PRODUCTION/alpha-upsell-shadow-bundle.js?\r\n> - and other URLs matching the static.alphwidget.com^ pattern\r\n> \r\n> are not harmful resources. These scripts provide useful information to web users, such as displaying product reviews or recommending similar items. They display content that the page administrator (the online seller) intends to show.\r\n> \r\n> Because of this, it seems the content provided by these links is not harmful advertising.  As a user, I am personally experiencing difficulties, especially when I try to view product reviews. \r\n> \r\n> I do not want to go through the inconvenience of having to disable Adblock, which is supposed to block harmful ads, just to shop online. \r\n> \r\n> I am reporting this because I visited a shopping site I frequently use and noticed things were different from usual. \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for creating and maintaining a wonderful product like Adblock. Best of luck.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @timothy-jeong\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/bsstr5uekr4888scoco8ko8cwsswc0c2b6lzdclxs8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/ojmvuqsvglwoss8wc0kogog4csw88gc2h3r1fqq5rw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/afrg7l1ix40g0ckg8c0gwgs0sw0goscclaop7bj5xs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/26j08xt0jb34kocsgsscss4s0wkcog8lj57of9ptdc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.17.3\r\nSystem version: | `macOS Sonoma, 14.0, Apple M2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `INISAFE SmartManagerEX, INISAFE CrossWeb EX, TouchEn PC`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=mac&product_version=2.17.3&system_version=macOS+Sonoma%2C+14.0%2C+Apple+M2&browser=chrome&filters=2&dns.enabled=false&browsing_security.enabled=false&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"label":{"id":762661226,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NjI2NjEyMjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/N:%20AdGuard%20for%20Mac","name":"N: AdGuard for Mac","color":"a64d79","default":false,"description":null},"labels":[{"id":252425980,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTI0MjU5ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/T:%20Incorrect%20Blocking","name":"T: Incorrect Blocking","color":"ff0000","default":false,"description":null},{"id":745624291,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NDU2MjQyOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/P1:%20Critical","name":"P1: Critical","color":"930000","default":false,"description":null},{"id":762659576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NjI2NTk1NzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/A:%20In%20progress","name":"A: In progress","color":"339966","default":false,"description":"Work on the issue is in progress"},{"id":762661226,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NjI2NjEyMjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/N:%20AdGuard%20for%20Mac","name":"N: AdGuard for Mac","color":"a64d79","default":false,"description":null}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-23T09:18:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Может провайдер блокирует сайт или ваш прокси? Проверьте настройки прокси в браузере.\r\n> \r\n> Я ответил: не работает сай rutracker.org, если на 30 секунд отключить adguard, то все сразу открывается\r\n> \r\n> Из моего ответа Вам не понятно, что проблема не в провайдере? или браузере? \r\n> \r\n> Далее пришел ответ от тех поддержки ответ:\r\n> Не присылайте одно и то же без ответов на вопросы. \r\n> \r\n> Можно переключить на специалиста, который сможет разобраться в проблеме?

I am mainly concerned about the Adguard public DNS viability of blocking the domain dai.google.com\n\nDAZN sports streaming service uses dynamic ad insertion in their broadcasts, therefore inserting personalized ads, not only on web browsers, but also on Smart TV devices where the only way to block ads would be using DNS blocking.\n\nDuring commercial breaks, requests to the domain in question can be evidenced.\n\nManually blocking requests to said domain does not break the video stream, it only makes it so ad breaks do not have personalized ads. Therefore adding this domain to the blocklist would allow users of DAZN service to enjoy their streams without personalized ads inserted during breaks, and instead allow us to watch the original broadcast ads.\n\n2.

Проверьте настройки прокси в браузере.\r\n> \r\n> Я ответил: не работает сай rutracker.org, если на 30 секунд отключить adguard, то все сразу открывается\r\n> \r\n> Из моего ответа Вам не понятно, что проблема не в провайдере? или браузере? \r\n> \r\n> Далее пришел ответ от тех поддержки ответ:\r\n> Не присылайте одно и то же без ответов на вопросы. \r\n> \r\n> Можно переключить на специалиста, который сможет разобраться в проблеме?
