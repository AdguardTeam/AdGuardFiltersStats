Comment\r\n> Following the issue linked below, it appears that several URLs important to online merchants are being blocked as advertisements [issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214522)\r\n> \r\n> The URLs being blocked, such as\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Common-Script/PRODUCTION/alphacore_alpha_data.js?\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Upsell-Script/PRODUCTION/alpha-upsell-shadow-bundle.js?\r\n> - and other URLs matching the static.alphwidget.com^ pattern\r\n> \r\n> are not harmful resources. These scripts provide useful information to web users, such as displaying product reviews or recommending similar items. They display content that the page administrator (the online seller) intends to show.\r\n> \r\n> Because of this, it seems the content provided by these links is not harmful advertising.  As a user, I am personally experiencing difficulties, especially when I try to view product reviews. \r\n> \r\n> I do not want to go through the inconvenience of having to disable Adblock, which is supposed to block harmful ads, just to shop online. \r\n> \r\n> I am reporting this because I visited a shopping site I frequently use and noticed things were different from usual. \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for creating and maintaining a wonderful product like Adblock. Best of luck.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @timothy-jeong\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/bsstr5uekr4888scoco8ko8cwsswc0c2b6lzdclxs8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/ojmvuqsvglwoss8wc0kogog4csw88gc2h3r1fqq5rw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/afrg7l1ix40g0ckg8c0gwgs0sw0goscclaop7bj5xs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/26j08xt0jb34kocsgsscss4s0wkcog8lj57of9ptdc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.17.3\r\nSystem version: | `macOS Sonoma, 14.0, Apple M2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `INISAFE SmartManagerEX, INISAFE CrossWeb EX, TouchEn PC`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=mac&product_version=2.17.3&system_version=macOS+Sonoma%2C+14.0%2C+Apple+M2&browser=chrome&filters=2&dns.enabled=false&browsing_security.enabled=false&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"assignee":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-23T07:25:57Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Common-Script/PRODUCTION/alphacore_alpha_data.js?\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Upsell-Script/PRODUCTION/alpha-upsell-shadow-bundle.js?\r\n> - and other URLs matching the static.alphwidget.com^ pattern\r\n> \r\n> are not harmful resources. These scripts provide useful information to web users, such as displaying product reviews or recommending similar items. They display content that the page administrator (the online seller) intends to show.\r\n> \r\n> Because of this, it seems the content provided by these links is not harmful advertising.  As a user, I am personally experiencing difficulties, especially when I try to view product reviews. \r\n> \r\n> I do not want to go through the inconvenience of having to disable Adblock, which is supposed to block harmful ads, just to shop online. \r\n> \r\n> I am reporting this because I visited a shopping site I frequently use and noticed things were different from usual. \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for creating and maintaining a wonderful product like Adblock. Best of luck.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @timothy-jeong\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/bsstr5uekr4888scoco8ko8cwsswc0c2b6lzdclxs8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/ojmvuqsvglwoss8wc0kogog4csw88gc2h3r1fqq5rw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/afrg7l1ix40g0ckg8c0gwgs0sw0goscclaop7bj5xs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/26j08xt0jb34kocsgsscss4s0wkcog8lj57of9ptdc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.17.3\r\nSystem version: | `macOS Sonoma, 14.0, Apple M2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `INISAFE SmartManagerEX, INISAFE CrossWeb EX, TouchEn PC`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=mac&product_version=2.17.3&system_version=macOS+Sonoma%2C+14.0%2C+Apple+M2&browser=chrome&filters=2&dns.enabled=false&browsing_security.enabled=false&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"label":{"id":762661226,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NjI2NjEyMjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/N:%20AdGuard%20for%20Mac","name":"N: AdGuard for Mac","color":"a64d79","default":false,"description":null},"labels":[{"id":252425980,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTI0MjU5ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/T:%20Incorrect%20Blocking","name":"T: Incorrect Blocking","color":"ff0000","default":false,"description":null},{"id":745624291,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NDU2MjQyOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/P1:%20Critical","name":"P1: Critical","color":"930000","default":false,"description":null},{"id":762659576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NjI2NTk1NzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/A:%20In%20progress","name":"A: In progress","color":"339966","default":false,"description":"Work on the issue is in progress"},{"id":762661226,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NjI2NjEyMjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/N:%20AdGuard%20for%20Mac","name":"N: AdGuard for Mac","color":"a64d79","default":false,"description":null}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-23T07:25:44Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Following the issue linked below, it appears that several URLs important to online merchants are being blocked as advertisements [issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214522)\r\n> \r\n> The URLs being blocked, such as\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Common-Script/PRODUCTION/alphacore_alpha_data.js?\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Upsell-Script/PRODUCTION/alpha-upsell-shadow-bundle.js?\r\n> - and other URLs matching the static.alphwidget.com^ pattern\r\n> \r\n> are not harmful resources. These scripts provide useful information to web users, such as displaying product reviews or recommending similar items.

Comment\r\n> Following the issue linked below, it appears that several URLs important to online merchants are being blocked as advertisements [issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214522)\r\n> \r\n> The URLs being blocked, such as\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Common-Script/PRODUCTION/alphacore_alpha_data.js?\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Upsell-Script/PRODUCTION/alpha-upsell-shadow-bundle.js?\r\n> - and other URLs matching the static.alphwidget.com^ pattern\r\n> \r\n> are not harmful resources. These scripts provide useful information to web users, such as displaying product reviews or recommending similar items. They display content that the page administrator (the online seller) intends to show.\r\n> \r\n> Because of this, it seems the content provided by these links is not harmful advertising.  As a user, I am personally experiencing difficulties, especially when I try to view product reviews. \r\n> \r\n> I do not want to go through the inconvenience of having to disable Adblock, which is supposed to block harmful ads, just to shop online. \r\n> \r\n> I am reporting this because I visited a shopping site I frequently use and noticed things were different from usual. \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for creating and maintaining a wonderful product like Adblock. Best of luck.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @timothy-jeong\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/bsstr5uekr4888scoco8ko8cwsswc0c2b6lzdclxs8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/ojmvuqsvglwoss8wc0kogog4csw88gc2h3r1fqq5rw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/afrg7l1ix40g0ckg8c0gwgs0sw0goscclaop7bj5xs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/26j08xt0jb34kocsgsscss4s0wkcog8lj57of9ptdc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.17.3\r\nSystem version: | `macOS Sonoma, 14.0, Apple M2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `INISAFE SmartManagerEX, INISAFE CrossWeb EX, TouchEn PC`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=mac&product_version=2.17.3&system_version=macOS+Sonoma%2C+14.0%2C+Apple+M2&browser=chrome&filters=2&dns.enabled=false&browsing_security.enabled=false&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-23T07:10:11Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Following the issue linked below, it appears that several URLs important to online merchants are being blocked as advertisements [issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214522)\r\n> \r\n> The URLs being blocked, such as\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Common-Script/PRODUCTION/alphacore_alpha_data.js?\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Upsell-Script/PRODUCTION/alpha-upsell-shadow-bundle.js?\r\n> - and other URLs matching the static.alphwidget.com^ pattern\r\n> \r\n> are not harmful resources. These scripts provide useful information to web users, such as displaying product reviews or recommending similar items. They display content that the page administrator (the online seller) intends to show.\r\n> \r\n> Because of this, it seems the content provided by these links is not harmful advertising.  As a user, I am personally experiencing difficulties, especially when I try to view product reviews. \r\n> \r\n> I do not want to go through the inconvenience of having to disable Adblock, which is supposed to block harmful ads, just to shop online. \r\n> \r\n> I am reporting this because I visited a shopping site I frequently use and noticed things were different from usual. \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for creating and maintaining a wonderful product like Adblock. Best of luck.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @timothy-jeong\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/bsstr5uekr4888scoco8ko8cwsswc0c2b6lzdclxs8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/ojmvuqsvglwoss8wc0kogog4csw88gc2h3r1fqq5rw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/afrg7l1ix40g0ckg8c0gwgs0sw0goscclaop7bj5xs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/26j08xt0jb34kocsgsscss4s0wkcog8lj57of9ptdc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.17.3\r\nSystem version: | `macOS Sonoma, 14.0, Apple M2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `INISAFE SmartManagerEX, INISAFE CrossWeb EX, TouchEn PC`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=mac&product_version=2.17.3&system_version=macOS+Sonoma%2C+14.0%2C+Apple+M2&browser=chrome&filters=2&dns.enabled=false&browsing_security.enabled=false&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3435613410","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069#issuecomment-3435613410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/216069","id":3435613410,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87Mx0zi","user":{"login":"timothy-jeong","id":53824764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODI0NzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53824764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong","html_url":"https://github.com/timothy-jeong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothy-jeong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-23T07:55:53Z","updated_at":"2025-10-23T07:55:53Z","body":"@zloydenHi!\nThank you for replying and Yes, I'll try the user rules and report back","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3435613410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-23T07:55:53Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Following the issue linked below, it appears that several URLs important to online merchants are being blocked as advertisements [issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214522)\r\n> \r\n> The URLs being blocked, such as\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Common-Script/PRODUCTION/alphacore_alpha_data.js?\r\n> - https://static.alphwidget.com/script/Upsell-Script/PRODUCTION/alpha-upsell-shadow-bundle.js?\r\n> - and other URLs matching the static.alphwidget.com^ pattern\r\n> \r\n> are not harmful resources. These scripts provide useful information to web users, such as displaying product reviews or recommending similar items.
