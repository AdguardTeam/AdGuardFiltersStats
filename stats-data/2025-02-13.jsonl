Comment\r\n> 1: For the first Pop-up you need to click around. You can't trigger it by just open the URL. Start like here https://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/ausland/ and click on one news. Now scroll down and up and leave Tab. Click back in Tab and one of this step should trigger Push Pop-up.\r\n> 2: Leave the Tab open for like 30-60 minutes. \"There are new News\" Pop-up only appear when the page actuall has new News and this can vary a lot, so you have to be really patient, before you say \"can't reproduce\"\r\nUsername: `@Morku`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n

Hello. The rule `l2top.ru#%#//scriptlet('prevent-eval-if', 'ad_signature')` breaks the security check from Cloudflare on the page https://l2top.ru/login, because of this rule the page completely freezes. The check from Cloudflare does not always happen, to open it you need to clear the cache and cookies. Disabling this rule solves the problem.\n\n2.

Comment\r\n> 1: For the first Pop-up you need to click around. You can't trigger it by just open the URL. Start like here https://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/ausland/ and click on one news. Now scroll down and up and leave Tab. Click back in Tab and one of this step should trigger Push Pop-up.\r\n> 2: Leave the Tab open for like 30-60 minutes. \"There are new News\" Pop-up only appear when the page actuall has new News and this can vary a lot, so you have to be really patient, before you say \"can't reproduce\"\r\nUsername: `@Morku`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n

When I hover my cursor over a video thumbnail, AdGuard incorrectly identifies it as an ad and counts it in the \"Blocked ads\" statistics. This doesn’t cause any functional issues, but it skews the statistics, making it seem like a large number of ads have been blocked when they haven’t.\r\n> \r\n> Steps to Reproduce:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Open YouTube in Opera GX with AdGuard AdBlocker enabled.\r\n> \r\n> 2. Hover your cursor over any video thumbnail.\r\n> \r\n> 3. Check the AdGuard statistics – the video hover will be counted as a blocked ad.\r\n> \r\n> Expected Behavior:\r\n> Hovering over video thumbnails should not be counted as blocked ads.\r\nUsername: `@i dont have github account`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/j00z1mypjlwk44okk0sgw88c4gkww0cdjrit5zdktk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.0.190 MV3\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Opera GX\r\nTracking protection options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Extensions: 7TV Nightly, AdGuard AdBlocker, AI Subtitles & Immersive Translate - Trancy, Bitwarden Password Manager, Dark Reader, Opera Ad Blocker, Return YouTube Dislike, Shazam: Find song names from your browser, Tampermonkey, Vytal - Spoof Timezone, Geolocation, Locale and security.
