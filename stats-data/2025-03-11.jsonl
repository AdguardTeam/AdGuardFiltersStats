The issue is that the domains in AdGuard DNS are not actually blocked; I can still access them even though they are marked as blocked. This applies to both newly registered domains and those that have been manually blocked and Parent control either. They appear as blocked in the dashboard, as shown in the attached screenshots. However, I can still access the sites even when they are indicated as blocked, which means that no domains are effectively being blocked.\r\n> This is clearly illustrated in a GitHub issue https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/875  where a user has google.com on their blocklist, yet they can still access google.com, and the log shows it as blocked. The core problem is that no domains are being blocked, despite being displayed as such.\r\n> I have attached a screenshot of a newly registered domain, which is marked as \"Newly Registered\" in the log, yet I was still able to access it. Initially, a DNS developer closed the issue, but I believe there may have been a misunderstanding.

The issue is that the domains in AdGuard DNS are not actually blocked; I can still access them even though they are marked as blocked. This applies to both newly registered domains and those that have been manually blocked and Parent control either. They appear as blocked in the dashboard, as shown in the attached screenshots. However, I can still access the sites even when they are indicated as blocked, which means that no domains are effectively being blocked.\r\n> This is clearly illustrated in a GitHub issue https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/875  where a user has google.com on their blocklist, yet they can still access google.com, and the log shows it as blocked. The core problem is that no domains are being blocked, despite being displayed as such.\r\n> I have attached a screenshot of a newly registered domain, which is marked as \"Newly Registered\" in the log, yet I was still able to access it. Initially, a DNS developer closed the issue, but I believe there may have been a misunderstanding. So, I reached out to support again, and here I am. :)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/r86s9ty6w2swwwwokos8wckg088o8kwhzj72oiva5c.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/an1yqdlswxcskc0gscw00wwsk0gckg0jdxw3it8k7w.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/i1l8nmkcgfsw0owc0sow88gw8gcgggorv3lzygebr4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/rb5hzabgbu8so8gow88g80wwocsg0sgjqxuphnc9xs.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ca48jlt9d80sggkss04g8o84ww8c4s4m4h0se09e6o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | iPhone, iPad, Mac computer\r\nDNS server: | Private AdGuard DNS server\r\nSystem version: | Latest version\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nBlocklists: | <b>General:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>AdGuard DNS Popup Hosts, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Dan Pollock's List, <br/>OISD Blocklist Small, <br/>1Hosts (Lite), <br/>OISD Blocklist Big, <br/>Steven Black's List, <br/>HaGeZi's Normal Blocklist, <br/>HaGeZi's Ultimate Blocklist, <br/>HaGeZi's Pro++ Blocklist, <br/>AWAvenue Ads Rule, <br/>HaGeZi's Pro Blocklist, <br/>1Hosts (mini)<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Dandelion Sprout's Game Console Adblock List, <br/>Perflyst and Dandelion Sprout's Smart-TV Blocklist, <br/>WindowsSpyBlocker - Hosts spy rules, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Anti Push Notifications, <br/>HaGeZi's Xiaomi Tracker Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Phishing Army, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List, <br/>Malicious URL Blocklist (URLHaus), <br/>NoCoin Filter List, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist (PhishTank and OpenPhish), <br/>Stalkerware Indicators List, <br/>ShadowWhisperer's Malware List, <br/>HaGeZi's Threat Intelligence Feeds, <br/>HaGeZi's The World's Most Abused TLDs, <br/>HaGeZi's Encrypted DNS/VPN/TOR/Proxy Bypass","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200544/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-11T08:39:57Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

The issue is that the domains in AdGuard DNS are not actually blocked; I can still access them even though they are marked as blocked. This applies to both newly registered domains and those that have been manually blocked and Parent control either. They appear as blocked in the dashboard, as shown in the attached screenshots. However, I can still access the sites even when they are indicated as blocked, which means that no domains are effectively being blocked.\r\n> This is clearly illustrated in a GitHub issue https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/875  where a user has google.com on their blocklist, yet they can still access google.com, and the log shows it as blocked. The core problem is that no domains are being blocked, despite being displayed as such.\r\n> I have attached a screenshot of a newly registered domain, which is marked as \"Newly Registered\" in the log, yet I was still able to access it. Initially, a DNS developer closed the issue, but I believe there may have been a misunderstanding. So, I reached out to support again, and here I am. :)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/r86s9ty6w2swwwwokos8wckg088o8kwhzj72oiva5c.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/an1yqdlswxcskc0gscw00wwsk0gckg0jdxw3it8k7w.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/i1l8nmkcgfsw0owc0sow88gw8gcgggorv3lzygebr4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/rb5hzabgbu8so8gow88g80wwocsg0sgjqxuphnc9xs.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ca48jlt9d80sggkss04g8o84ww8c4s4m4h0se09e6o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | iPhone, iPad, Mac computer\r\nDNS server: | Private AdGuard DNS server\r\nSystem version: | Latest version\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nBlocklists: | <b>General:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>AdGuard DNS Popup Hosts, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Dan Pollock's List, <br/>OISD Blocklist Small, <br/>1Hosts (Lite), <br/>OISD Blocklist Big, <br/>Steven Black's List, <br/>HaGeZi's Normal Blocklist, <br/>HaGeZi's Ultimate Blocklist, <br/>HaGeZi's Pro++ Blocklist, <br/>AWAvenue Ads Rule, <br/>HaGeZi's Pro Blocklist, <br/>1Hosts (mini)<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Dandelion Sprout's Game Console Adblock List, <br/>Perflyst and Dandelion Sprout's Smart-TV Blocklist, <br/>WindowsSpyBlocker - Hosts spy rules, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Anti Push Notifications, <br/>HaGeZi's Xiaomi Tracker Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Phishing Army, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List, <br/>Malicious URL Blocklist (URLHaus), <br/>NoCoin Filter List, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist (PhishTank and OpenPhish), <br/>Stalkerware Indicators List, <br/>ShadowWhisperer's Malware List, <br/>HaGeZi's Threat Intelligence Feeds, <br/>HaGeZi's The World's Most Abused TLDs, <br/>HaGeZi's Encrypted DNS/VPN/TOR/Proxy Bypass","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200544/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-11T08:28:41Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

If I disable adguard completely (no autostart) the problem is gone and My Dacia does not require any login, just starts as it should, even after a reboot. This can be reproduced each time so I expect this is fully related to adguard.\r\n> \r\n> This is a follow-up oer your request on a previous report (ticket ) which is now closed. Suggestion is that the filtering team takes a look at this.\r\n> \r\n> I have tried every filter combination (and none at all), did a reset, deleted all app/cache data, you name it.  As soon as adguard runs the problem is back. As soon as adguard is uninstalled or disabled the problem is gone.\r\nUsername: `@robw-nl`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tfojbd5t7k004gso4wwcg48okwcocgs4a9glimbs4y.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pgvkbvoxpa8w0c0wgw0co4844ggskwosrkt664iyxw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.8\r\nSystem version: | Android 15\r\nBrowser: | Firefox Mobile\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Dutch\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200555/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-11T10:17:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
