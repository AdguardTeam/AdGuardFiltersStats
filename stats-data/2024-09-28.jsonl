Comment\r\n> Although adguard filtered properly in the past, for two days  now ads (probably coming from outbrain, see below) are not filtered anymore in the \"Spiegel\" app. Besides the ads I have

I tried everything suggested in the YT troubleshooting post, to no avail (cleared cache, cookies and history, update firefox, turned on and off all extensions one by one, tinkered with AG filters, etc) . It only happens on youtube.com, not music.youtube.com, so I believe that YT have found a new workaround adblockers ? Or am I the only one ?\r\nUsername: `@Anon`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/iv44r903sdssko4o0wkcscgkwwk8wkgbe1b51ipc7k.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.22\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard French\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Decentraleyes, DeArrow, SponsorBlock, Languagetool, Don't Accept image/webp, Highlight or Hide Search Engine Results, IGraal, Unhook","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2380716020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-09-28T15:51:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
