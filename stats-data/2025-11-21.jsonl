Comment\r\n> I'm not sure if this issue will be resolved, but I'm reporting it because I noticed it. As you can see from the screenshots, until I disable Adguard for Windows, I am unable to click on the 'Buy' button, which opens the 'Pop-up' where I can purchase the items and see how much they cost. The screenshots also show that the cookie pop-up has not been touched.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @sonnyxq\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n
