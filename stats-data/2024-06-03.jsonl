Comment\r\n> I use the app “Downie” https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/ to download audio, video, and images from various websites.   One such was of starting a download is to paste the URL of a page that contains the item you want to download.   \r\n> \r\n> This works 100% of the time for everything EXCEPT Twitter.   Excuse me, X.com.   \r\n> \r\n> So say I want to download this gif of a tornado that I just tweeted.  The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.   Disable it and you can now use either x.com or twitter.com URLs.\r\n> \r\n> A while back I THOUGHT i had nailed this down as being related to DNS Protection, which i had  been using at the time.

Comment\r\n> I use the app “Downie” https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/ to download audio, video, and images from various websites.   One such was of starting a download is to paste the URL of a page that contains the item you want to download.   \r\n> \r\n> This works 100% of the time for everything EXCEPT Twitter.   Excuse me, X.com.   \r\n> \r\n> So say I want to download this gif of a tornado that I just tweeted.  The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.   Disable it and you can now use either x.com or twitter.com URLs.\r\n> \r\n> A while back I THOUGHT i had nailed this down as being related to DNS Protection, which i had  been using at the time.  Seems like when I changed it or disabled it the problem went away, however that is not the case as of now.

The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.   Disable it and you can now use either x.com or twitter.com URLs.\r\n> \r\n> A while back I THOUGHT i had nailed this down as being related to DNS Protection, which i had  been using at the time.  Seems like when I changed it or disabled it the problem went away, however that is not the case as of now.   So the only workaround is to change the URL manually.\r\nUsername: `@petekjohnson`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2hn926dr1ym8ssscccswg0osw4g4ccge5e4zuoc6nw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3avlpgf7gpmookk8wwok00go80g0k0or8jv4569tsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4inmkqoses6cwck00k0g4kggk084w4scuu435qluj4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/k5j80az0yyo00ggogs4gs0c0ccgs8kkplp9qmb41k0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/olobxet5y68wskgs4cgks00wc0cg04gtbazl40rees.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/dy5dcp60nvkgg4c0so84gws4sk4soocl2sdssp4tf4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.14.0.1599 nightly\r\nSystem version: | macOS 14.5 Beta (23F5074a)\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode options: | Block Java, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your IP address (208.54.104.184), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Downie Safari Extension, AdGuard Assistant","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-03T06:27:13Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
