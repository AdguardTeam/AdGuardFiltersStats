you guys.\r\n> \r\n> I'm much too (young|old) to handle things like https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/issues/1165 being more concerned about his company's market value or something like that than on anything else, especially things like not *entirely* realising how nasty that domain parking services (which are apparently among his customers) can be in regards to malware redirections.\r\n> \r\n> **But** he has convinced me about 1 thing, which is that a lot of the entries I have/had for his company in Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List are not malware.\r\n> \r\n> I see there's precedence in AdGuard Tracking Protection Filter for blocking `||youseasky.com^`, which I can assure you is a good entry; but based on the wider patterns on https://urlscan.io/search/#page.ip:%2254.75.69.192%22, I propose 2 entries for AdGuard Tracking Protection Filter:\r\n> ```\r\n> ://euob.*.com/sxp^$script,3p\r\n> ://obseu.*.com/sxp^$script,3p\r\n> ```\r\n> You guys have probably been in many more such cases than me, so I'm more or less leaving this up to you guys.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @DandelionSprout\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.
