allowing and accepting the cookie popup..\r\nOnly problem is that allowing that cookie popup shouldn't be necessary, as the videos are displayed just fine without it, when using **EasyList – Cookie

Then I've tried use Chrome Extension only & use whitelist for URL ads.google.com. \r\n> \r\n> But it doesn’t work correctly, I have broken images f.e. on the Google Ads dashboard and so.
