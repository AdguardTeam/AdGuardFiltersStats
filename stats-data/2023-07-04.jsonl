Comment\r\nUsername: @demidova1331\r\n> Ранее реклама была всегда лишь внизу экрана.  Единожды появилась на весь экран. Теперь же полноэкранные рекламы всплывают всё чаще и чаще. Пишу о проблеме уже в третий раз. С чем связано, что AdGuard перестал справляться со своей задачей?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/p8582gaieysgssks0sksoco4cg4w8s8c655cupzxtc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/5w3hh9d64bggkw0ckcwwcsoo8o8g04opx8rvjwak2s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 31\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.0.912;4.0.912\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>EasyList, <br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1619862721","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155351#issuecomment-1619862721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155351","id":1619862721,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85gjSTB","user":{"login":"demidova1331","id":127888288,"node_id":"U_kgDOB59roA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127888288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demidova1331","html_url":"https://github.com/demidova1331","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demidova1331/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demidova1331/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demidova1331/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demidova1331/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demidova1331/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demidova1331/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demidova1331/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demidova1331/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demidova1331/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-04T09:14:18Z","updated_at":"2023-07-04T09:14:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nЗдравствуйте.  Вчера всё было прекрасно.

Comment\r\nUsername: @demidova1331\r\n> Ранее реклама была всегда лишь внизу экрана.  Единожды появилась на весь экран. Теперь же полноэкранные рекламы всплывают всё чаще и чаще. Пишу о проблеме уже в третий раз. С чем связано, что AdGuard перестал справляться со своей задачей?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/p8582gaieysgssks0sksoco4cg4w8s8c655cupzxtc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/5w3hh9d64bggkw0ckcwwcsoo8o8g04opx8rvjwak2s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 31\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.0.912;4.0.912\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>EasyList, <br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1620088969","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155351#issuecomment-1620088969","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155351","id":1620088969,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85gkJiJ","user":{"login":"Sergey-Lyapin","id":18536328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM2MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18536328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin","html_url":"https://github.com/Sergey-Lyapin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-04T11:41:06Z","updated_at":"2023-07-04T11:41:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Нет, в \"пользовательские правила\" (щиток внизу второй слева > блокировка рекламы)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1620088969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-04T11:41:07Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
