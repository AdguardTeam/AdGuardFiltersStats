Comment\r\n> Hello.\r\n> \r\n> This Issue is not a filter issue, but rather a report of a malfunction in the Google Chrome extension AdGuard Ad Blocker MV3 Stable 5.0.161.\r\n> \r\n> I contacted the AdGuard support team `(support@adguard.com)` and they replied that they needed additional information about the operating environment and asked me to report it using their dedicated reporting tool, so I am reporting it here again.\r\n> \r\n> The specific symptoms of the supposed bug are as follows.\r\n> The images with AdGuard turned on/off are identical.\r\n> Clicking on the “Open Editor in New Window” icon in the User Rules section does not work and does not allow the editor to open in a new window.\r\n> \r\n> We would appreciate it if you could fix this problem.\r\n\r\n###
