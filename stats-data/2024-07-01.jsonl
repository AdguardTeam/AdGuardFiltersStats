Comment\r\n> The issue stems from iPhone's Adguard not properly handling iframes. There is no rule to hide the ad placeholders. On PCs, blocking the script results in a size of zero.

If there are other causes for this issue, I would appreciate learning about them for future reference.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> <div style=\"text-align: center;margin-top: 8px;\">\r\n> <!-- Revive Adserver iFrame Tag - Generated with Revive Adserver v5.4.1 -->\r\n> <iframe id=\"a2b3245a\" name=\"a2b3245a\" src=\"https://mmmdn.net/revive/www/delivery/afr.php?zoneid=142&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"360\" height=\"300\" allow=\"autoplay\">…</iframe>\r\n> </div>\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> \r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ilsgty2a8tw8cw4sss8oo8ok8ggo44w2wfui9onj8s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182645/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-01T10:57:38Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Adguard on iPhone is experiencing an issue with handling iframes, which results in the inability to hide ad placeholders. Unlike on PC, where blocking the script makes the ad frame disappear, the iframe remains on iPhone, making it natural for the ad frame to still be visible. If there's any other reason for this issue, please let me know for future reference.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> <div style=\"text-align: center;margin-top: 8px;\">\r\n> <!-- Revive Adserver iFrame Tag - Generated with Revive Adserver v5.4.1 -->\r\n> <iframe id=\"a4000a8e\" name=\"a4000a8e\" src=\"https://mmmdn.net/revive/www/delivery/afr.php?zoneid=145&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"360\" height=\"300\" allow=\"autoplay\">…</iframe>\r\n> </div\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/1a6lf5zfp0ys0wwcc4o04wwccg08gsor5yy3qest34.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182644/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-01T10:51:29Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
