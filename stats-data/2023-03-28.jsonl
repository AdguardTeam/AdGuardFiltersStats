Comment\r\nUsername: @misc-activities\r\n> In the Walmart login page (see 0.png), I entered my email address and clicked on the Continue button. It opened a message box trying to show me a \"Press and Hold\" type CAPTCHA but the CAPTCHA didn't load. This can be seen in 1.png. So, I clicked on \"Try a different method\" in the message box. When I did that, it showed me a picture identification type CAPTCHA (see 2.png). When I completed the CAPTCHA verification, instead of asking me for the password, it went back to the page where it was asking for my email address and showed a message saying, \"Something went wrong, please try again.\" This can be seen in 3.png.\r\n> \r\n> I closed the AdGuard app and tried and I was able to login successfully.
