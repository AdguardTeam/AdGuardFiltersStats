Comment\r\nUsername: @misc-activities\r\n> In the Walmart login page (see 0.png), I entered my email address and clicked on the Continue button. It opened a message box trying to show me a \"Press and Hold\" type CAPTCHA but the CAPTCHA didn't load. This can be seen in 1.png. So, I clicked on \"Try a different method\" in the message box. When I did that, it showed me a picture identification type CAPTCHA (see 2.png). When I completed the CAPTCHA verification, instead of asking me for the password, it went back to the page where it was asking for my email address and showed a message saying, \"Something went wrong, please try again.\" This can be seen in 3.png.\r\n> \r\n> I closed the AdGuard app and tried and I was able to login successfully.

Comment\r\nUsername: @quaybj\r\n> This food ordering site has the option to get weekly discounts.  The link to the promotion number and the discounted list does not work with adguard installed on my machines (MAC and PC). I have Chrome, Firefox, and Brave.  That particular URL is blocked for all of them.  I am using https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query in my router DNS setting.  Disabling adguard in the browsers does not work, maybe because it's the router DNS?  The picture where the box is seen is from a machine where adguard is not installed at all.  \r\n> \r\n> While making this query, I saw a lot of references to information on the settings for adguard, can you point me to the manual?  I don't even know if I am using some of the settings or not, so I could not really answer the questions.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/X9bzzF4.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/yimObJ0.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/54ilnKm.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11.3\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://unfiltered.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.freshdirect.com/login/login.jsp?successPage=/your_account/chef_table.jsp](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freshdirect.com%2Flogin%2Flogin.jsp%3FsuccessPage%3D%2Fyour_account%2Fchef_table.jsp)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145214/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1486726197","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145214#issuecomment-1486726197","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145214","id":1486726197,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85YnaQ1","user":{"login":"Sergey-Lyapin","id":18536328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM2MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18536328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin","html_url":"https://github.com/Sergey-Lyapin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-28T11:52:59Z","updated_at":"2023-03-28T11:52:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@quaybj","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1486726197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-28T11:53:00Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
