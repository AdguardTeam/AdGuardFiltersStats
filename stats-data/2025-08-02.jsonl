API аналитики:\n**discord-analytics.com** (основной домен для сбора данных) - отсутствует в DNS-фильтре AG.\n**sentry.io** (отслеживание ошибок и производительности) - отсутствует в DNS-фильтре AG.\n_Вопрос блокировки sentry.io требует дополнительного изучения. Если адрес используется для отправки автоматических отчётов об ошибках, наверно, адрес блокировать не следует, но если адрес используется, например, для передачи сведений об устройстве и установленных или активных приложениях, я считаю, его следует заблокировать._\n**raygun.io** (мониторинг пользовательских сессий) - присутствует в DNS-фильтре AG.\n\n2. Специфичные поддомены Discord:\n**metrics.discordapp.com** - отсутствует в DNS-фильтре AG.\n**telemetry.discord.com** - отсутствует в DNS-фильтре AG.\n**science.discordapp.com** - отсутствует в DNS-фильтре AG.\n**tracking.discord.gg** - отсутствует в DNS-фильтре AG.\n\n3. Сторонние сервисы:\n**amplitude.com** (аналитика поведения пользователей) - присутствует в DNS-фильтре AG.\n**segment.io** (сбор данных для маркетинга) - присутствует в DNS-фильтре AG.\n**google-analytics.com** (если интегрировано через плагины) - присутствует в DNS-фильтре AG.\n\nЯ попробовал, у себя на устройстве, заблокировать адреса, которые отсутствуют в DNS-фильтре AdGuard, на работоспособность программы это ни как не повлияло.\n\nWindows 10 Home 22H2 x64\nAdGuard 7.21.1\nAdGuard DNS-фильтр 1.0.32.66\nDiscord Stable 426030 (41bf48e) Host 1.0.9201 x64 (66940) Build Override: N/A Windows 10 64-bit (10.0.19045)\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nПожалуйста, изучите вопрос аналитики и рекламы в Discord.\nВ частости, в десктопной программе, веб-версии и приложениях для мобильных устройств.\nПри необходимости, дополните DNS-фильтр AdGuard.\nСпасибо.\n\n### Additional information\n\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46d1173f-34ac-4d19-b8a7-ec20603b80b8\" />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210569/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-08-02T06:22:18Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

There was an ad at the end of each comic, and the New & Hot reappeared again. I didn't change any settings in AdGuard. I was only using the general AdGuard block list before. No other site/app had ads, just Webtoon. Somehow they circumvented ad blocking. I added a handful of new lists to AdGuard including Peter Lowe's, etc., and that helped with the ad at the end of the comic, but there is still the annoying New & Hot as well as pop ups like \"buy our coins!!\" I'm not sure what happened but the app is way more annoying to use now.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/qaxswspnjo0cs4w80kc00ckwcgss8coam2e56quymw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | Private AdGuard DNS server\r\nSystem version: | `Android 15`\r\nBrowser: | It's the app\r\nBlocklists: | <b>General:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>OISD Blocklist Small, <br/>Dan Pollock's List","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210600/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-08-02T20:43:38Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
