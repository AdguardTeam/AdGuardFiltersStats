Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://m.naver.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.naver.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Hello, this is the Naver Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS (dns.adguard.com) cannot access naver.com domains. We received confirmation from AdGuard support that naver.com domains are not blocked.\r\n> \r\n> As a follow-up, we would like to provide additional details about the ongoing issue.\r\n> \r\n> **Issue Overview:**\r\n> We have recently received numerous reports from customers experiencing difficulties accessing Naver-related services through Android apps (Chrome, Google app, Naver app, etc.) when using AdGuard DNS. Based on customer inquiries and internal reproduction tests, we have confirmed that this issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS in conjunction with LG U+, a major network provider in South Korea.\r\n> \r\n> **Symptoms:**\r\n> * Various Naver services (Naver Search, Naver Shopping, Naver News, etc.) are inaccessible or fail to load properly\r\n>   > For example, when accessing \"m.naver.com\" through mobile Chrome or Google app, users encounter errors such as \"Unable to connect to the Internet\" or \"This site can't be reached\"\r\n>   > Web pages fail to load in browser apps, displaying ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED errors\r\n> * The issue is primarily reported by Android users\r\n> * The problem occurs intermittently (not continuously), sometimes lasting several minutes\r\n> * Our internal testing confirms the issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS with the LG U+ network\r\n>   > Configuration: Phone Settings > Connections > More connection settings > Private DNS > dns.adguard-dns.com (or dns.adguard.com)\r\n> \r\n> **Actions Taken:**\r\n> The Naver development team has contacted the LG U+ network team to investigate this issue further. We are reaching out to request AdGuard's cooperation as well, as this appears to be an interaction between AdGuard DNS and the LG U+ network that is affecting our users' ability to access Naver services.\r\n> \r\n> We appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/l12z5xty3tsk004k8000skoks8w80wsb2r994pz5r4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/16ho0xijiiw0g4w8gookogko4g4ss0kphwb4855j00.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/sy801lsz4000s8c0s0wgkwcc4s0wcg4dje2wixxao0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/eqnqnc2iq8g8g04cw8o0ksogcg8gg48lnokjgnjwzk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/iadqmo6ipq0wocgkcwggs8o0k8ggk40tpgtxpyimsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/oljxujs1sn4w8swck4okwgow4ssswk0e96d8hnp0f4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/tkvknvqico0gw4880gs0kcokg444woseo1nz2b8zfc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/6s32hb49exgc48k8kcowg04ogowgcowbz4xhkisev4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Android 16`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3726661575","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474#issuecomment-3726661575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474","id":3726661575,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87eIFfH","user":{"login":"JunyeongSeok","id":11582227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTgyMjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11582227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok","html_url":"https://github.com/JunyeongSeok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-09T01:26:25Z","updated_at":"2026-01-09T01:26:25Z","body":"One of our team members has reproduced the issue and provided the result you requested.  \nWhen accessing https://dns.adguard-dns.com/info.txt (with AdGuard DNS disabled), the page simply displayed the text `hk-3`.\n\nIf you'd like to see the full steps or a video of the issue occurring, please let me know.

Disabling the AdGuard \"Base\" filter resolves the issue globally, as does adding a site specific rule to the user rules such as this:\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> `@@||titantalk.com^$document`\r\n> \r\n> But of course this pretty much negates all AdGuard features and I have been unable to successfully find a more specific rule that removes the myriad ads without causing the Safari error\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/36m6rjyjmy04swgsoskgkksso4w4w8gm8kudyqni74.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/8m6twyshdcg8kss4k48wc0os00gsowkll8pf4v6js0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.24\r\nSystem version: | `MacOS 26.2 and iOS 26.2`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nOther extensions used: | `N/A`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/222181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/222181/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"label":{"id":8128549891,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAVlsM88AAAAB5H_UAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/Ad-Shield","name":"Ad-Shield","color":"ff0000","default":false,"description":""},"labels":[{"id":252425980,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTI0MjU5ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/T:%20Incorrect%20Blocking","name":"T: Incorrect Blocking","color":"ff0000","default":false,"description":null},{"id":701351120,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDEzNTExMjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/P4:%20Low","name":"P4: Low","color":"326a1a","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1564392165,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTY0MzkyMTY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/A:%20Problematic","name":"A: Problematic","color":"0b0059","default":false,"description":"Issues, which cannot be resolved easily"},{"id":2160851735,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTYwODUxNzM1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/N:%20AdGuard%20for%20Safari","name":"N: AdGuard for Safari","color":"584eb2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":8128549891,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAVlsM88AAAAB5H_UAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/Ad-Shield","name":"Ad-Shield","color":"ff0000","default":false,"description":""}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2026-01-09T01:46:16Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://m.naver.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.naver.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Hello, this is the Naver Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS (dns.adguard.com) cannot access naver.com domains. We received confirmation from AdGuard support that naver.com domains are not blocked.\r\n> \r\n> As a follow-up, we would like to provide additional details about the ongoing issue.\r\n> \r\n> **Issue Overview:**\r\n> We have recently received numerous reports from customers experiencing difficulties accessing Naver-related services through Android apps (Chrome, Google app, Naver app, etc.) when using AdGuard DNS. Based on customer inquiries and internal reproduction tests, we have confirmed that this issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS in conjunction with LG U+, a major network provider in South Korea.\r\n> \r\n> **Symptoms:**\r\n> * Various Naver services (Naver Search, Naver Shopping, Naver News, etc.) are inaccessible or fail to load properly\r\n>   > For example, when accessing \"m.naver.com\" through mobile Chrome or Google app, users encounter errors such as \"Unable to connect to the Internet\" or \"This site can't be reached\"\r\n>   > Web pages fail to load in browser apps, displaying ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED errors\r\n> * The issue is primarily reported by Android users\r\n> * The problem occurs intermittently (not continuously), sometimes lasting several minutes\r\n> * Our internal testing confirms the issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS with the LG U+ network\r\n>   > Configuration: Phone Settings > Connections > More connection settings > Private DNS > dns.adguard-dns.com (or dns.adguard.com)\r\n> \r\n> **Actions Taken:**\r\n> The Naver development team has contacted the LG U+ network team to investigate this issue further. We are reaching out to request AdGuard's cooperation as well, as this appears to be an interaction between AdGuard DNS and the LG U+ network that is affecting our users' ability to access Naver services.\r\n> \r\n> We appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/l12z5xty3tsk004k8000skoks8w80wsb2r994pz5r4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/16ho0xijiiw0g4w8gookogko4g4ss0kphwb4855j00.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/sy801lsz4000s8c0s0wgkwcc4s0wcg4dje2wixxao0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/eqnqnc2iq8g8g04cw8o0ksogcg8gg48lnokjgnjwzk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/iadqmo6ipq0wocgkcwggs8o0k8ggk40tpgtxpyimsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/oljxujs1sn4w8swck4okwgow4ssswk0e96d8hnp0f4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/tkvknvqico0gw4880gs0kcokg444woseo1nz2b8zfc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/6s32hb49exgc48k8kcowg04ogowgcowbz4xhkisev4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Android 16`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3726962014","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474#issuecomment-3726962014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474","id":3726962014,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87eJO1e","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-09T03:43:37Z","updated_at":"2026-01-09T03:43:37Z","body":"OK.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://m.naver.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.naver.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Hello, this is the Naver Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS (dns.adguard.com) cannot access naver.com domains. We received confirmation from AdGuard support that naver.com domains are not blocked.\r\n> \r\n> As a follow-up, we would like to provide additional details about the ongoing issue.\r\n> \r\n> **Issue Overview:**\r\n> We have recently received numerous reports from customers experiencing difficulties accessing Naver-related services through Android apps (Chrome, Google app, Naver app, etc.) when using AdGuard DNS. Based on customer inquiries and internal reproduction tests, we have confirmed that this issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS in conjunction with LG U+, a major network provider in South Korea.\r\n> \r\n> **Symptoms:**\r\n> * Various Naver services (Naver Search, Naver Shopping, Naver News, etc.) are inaccessible or fail to load properly\r\n>   > For example, when accessing \"m.naver.com\" through mobile Chrome or Google app, users encounter errors such as \"Unable to connect to the Internet\" or \"This site can't be reached\"\r\n>   > Web pages fail to load in browser apps, displaying ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED errors\r\n> * The issue is primarily reported by Android users\r\n> * The problem occurs intermittently (not continuously), sometimes lasting several minutes\r\n> * Our internal testing confirms the issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS with the LG U+ network\r\n>   > Configuration: Phone Settings > Connections > More connection settings > Private DNS > dns.adguard-dns.com (or dns.adguard.com)\r\n> \r\n> **Actions Taken:**\r\n> The Naver development team has contacted the LG U+ network team to investigate this issue further. We are reaching out to request AdGuard's cooperation as well, as this appears to be an interaction between AdGuard DNS and the LG U+ network that is affecting our users' ability to access Naver services.\r\n> \r\n> We appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/l12z5xty3tsk004k8000skoks8w80wsb2r994pz5r4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/16ho0xijiiw0g4w8gookogko4g4ss0kphwb4855j00.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/sy801lsz4000s8c0s0wgkwcc4s0wcg4dje2wixxao0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/eqnqnc2iq8g8g04cw8o0ksogcg8gg48lnokjgnjwzk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/iadqmo6ipq0wocgkcwggs8o0k8ggk40tpgtxpyimsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/oljxujs1sn4w8swck4okwgow4ssswk0e96d8hnp0f4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/tkvknvqico0gw4880gs0kcokg444woseo1nz2b8zfc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/6s32hb49exgc48k8kcowg04ogowgcowbz4xhkisev4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Android 16`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3727728454","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474#issuecomment-3727728454","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474","id":3727728454,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87eMJ9G","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-09T08:23:21Z","updated_at":"2026-01-09T08:25:35Z","body":"I can reproduce now.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://m.naver.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.naver.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Hello, this is the Naver Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS (dns.adguard.com) cannot access naver.com domains. We received confirmation from AdGuard support that naver.com domains are not blocked.\r\n> \r\n> As a follow-up, we would like to provide additional details about the ongoing issue.\r\n> \r\n> **Issue Overview:**\r\n> We have recently received numerous reports from customers experiencing difficulties accessing Naver-related services through Android apps (Chrome, Google app, Naver app, etc.) when using AdGuard DNS. Based on customer inquiries and internal reproduction tests, we have confirmed that this issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS in conjunction with LG U+, a major network provider in South Korea.\r\n> \r\n> **Symptoms:**\r\n> * Various Naver services (Naver Search, Naver Shopping, Naver News, etc.) are inaccessible or fail to load properly\r\n>   > For example, when accessing \"m.naver.com\" through mobile Chrome or Google app, users encounter errors such as \"Unable to connect to the Internet\" or \"This site can't be reached\"\r\n>   > Web pages fail to load in browser apps, displaying ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED errors\r\n> * The issue is primarily reported by Android users\r\n> * The problem occurs intermittently (not continuously), sometimes lasting several minutes\r\n> * Our internal testing confirms the issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS with the LG U+ network\r\n>   > Configuration: Phone Settings > Connections > More connection settings > Private DNS > dns.adguard-dns.com (or dns.adguard.com)\r\n> \r\n> **Actions Taken:**\r\n> The Naver development team has contacted the LG U+ network team to investigate this issue further. We are reaching out to request AdGuard's cooperation as well, as this appears to be an interaction between AdGuard DNS and the LG U+ network that is affecting our users' ability to access Naver services.\r\n> \r\n> We appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/l12z5xty3tsk004k8000skoks8w80wsb2r994pz5r4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/16ho0xijiiw0g4w8gookogko4g4ss0kphwb4855j00.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/sy801lsz4000s8c0s0wgkwcc4s0wcg4dje2wixxao0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/eqnqnc2iq8g8g04cw8o0ksogcg8gg48lnokjgnjwzk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/iadqmo6ipq0wocgkcwggs8o0k8ggk40tpgtxpyimsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/oljxujs1sn4w8swck4okwgow4ssswk0e96d8hnp0f4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/tkvknvqico0gw4880gs0kcokg444woseo1nz2b8zfc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/6s32hb49exgc48k8kcowg04ogowgcowbz4xhkisev4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Android 16`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3728108399","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474#issuecomment-3728108399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474","id":3728108399,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87eNmtv","user":{"login":"ameshkov","id":5947035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDcwMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5947035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameshkov","html_url":"https://github.com/ameshkov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameshkov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameshkov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameshkov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameshkov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameshkov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameshkov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameshkov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameshkov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameshkov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-09T09:41:19Z","updated_at":"2026-01-09T09:41:19Z","body":"@JunyeongSeok just a quick note, the issue is not blocking, for some reason the recursive resolver in Hong Kong fails to resolve naver domains.\n\nMy guess is that it only fails to resolve it when the DNS query contains a specific EDNS Client Subnet.\n\nIn order to reproduce it we'll need to know the /24 subnet of a user who can reproduce it now.\n\n@piquark6046 if you are able to reproduce the issue please share your current /24 subnet (your IP address with the last part replaced by 0).

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://m.naver.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.naver.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Hello, this is the Naver Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS (dns.adguard.com) cannot access naver.com domains. We received confirmation from AdGuard support that naver.com domains are not blocked.\r\n> \r\n> As a follow-up, we would like to provide additional details about the ongoing issue.\r\n> \r\n> **Issue Overview:**\r\n> We have recently received numerous reports from customers experiencing difficulties accessing Naver-related services through Android apps (Chrome, Google app, Naver app, etc.) when using AdGuard DNS. Based on customer inquiries and internal reproduction tests, we have confirmed that this issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS in conjunction with LG U+, a major network provider in South Korea.\r\n> \r\n> **Symptoms:**\r\n> * Various Naver services (Naver Search, Naver Shopping, Naver News, etc.) are inaccessible or fail to load properly\r\n>   > For example, when accessing \"m.naver.com\" through mobile Chrome or Google app, users encounter errors such as \"Unable to connect to the Internet\" or \"This site can't be reached\"\r\n>   > Web pages fail to load in browser apps, displaying ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED errors\r\n> * The issue is primarily reported by Android users\r\n> * The problem occurs intermittently (not continuously), sometimes lasting several minutes\r\n> * Our internal testing confirms the issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS with the LG U+ network\r\n>   > Configuration: Phone Settings > Connections > More connection settings > Private DNS > dns.adguard-dns.com (or dns.adguard.com)\r\n> \r\n> **Actions Taken:**\r\n> The Naver development team has contacted the LG U+ network team to investigate this issue further. We are reaching out to request AdGuard's cooperation as well, as this appears to be an interaction between AdGuard DNS and the LG U+ network that is affecting our users' ability to access Naver services.\r\n> \r\n> We appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/l12z5xty3tsk004k8000skoks8w80wsb2r994pz5r4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/16ho0xijiiw0g4w8gookogko4g4ss0kphwb4855j00.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/sy801lsz4000s8c0s0wgkwcc4s0wcg4dje2wixxao0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/eqnqnc2iq8g8g04cw8o0ksogcg8gg48lnokjgnjwzk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/iadqmo6ipq0wocgkcwggs8o0k8ggk40tpgtxpyimsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/oljxujs1sn4w8swck4okwgow4ssswk0e96d8hnp0f4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/tkvknvqico0gw4880gs0kcokg444woseo1nz2b8zfc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/6s32hb49exgc48k8kcowg04ogowgcowbz4xhkisev4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Android 16`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3728044732","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474#issuecomment-3728044732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474","id":3728044732,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87eNXK8","user":{"login":"JunyeongSeok","id":11582227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTgyMjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11582227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok","html_url":"https://github.com/JunyeongSeok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunyeongSeok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-09T09:26:02Z","updated_at":"2026-01-09T09:26:02Z","body":"Thanks for sharing the capture with all the AdGuard environment settings.\n\nBased on these configurations, do you think this issue could be related to AdGuard DNS?

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://m.naver.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.naver.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Hello, this is the Naver Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS (dns.adguard.com) cannot access naver.com domains. We received confirmation from AdGuard support that naver.com domains are not blocked.\r\n> \r\n> As a follow-up, we would like to provide additional details about the ongoing issue.\r\n> \r\n> **Issue Overview:**\r\n> We have recently received numerous reports from customers experiencing difficulties accessing Naver-related services through Android apps (Chrome, Google app, Naver app, etc.) when using AdGuard DNS. Based on customer inquiries and internal reproduction tests, we have confirmed that this issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS in conjunction with LG U+, a major network provider in South Korea.\r\n> \r\n> **Symptoms:**\r\n> * Various Naver services (Naver Search, Naver Shopping, Naver News, etc.) are inaccessible or fail to load properly\r\n>   > For example, when accessing \"m.naver.com\" through mobile Chrome or Google app, users encounter errors such as \"Unable to connect to the Internet\" or \"This site can't be reached\"\r\n>   > Web pages fail to load in browser apps, displaying ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED errors\r\n> * The issue is primarily reported by Android users\r\n> * The problem occurs intermittently (not continuously), sometimes lasting several minutes\r\n> * Our internal testing confirms the issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS with the LG U+ network\r\n>   > Configuration: Phone Settings > Connections > More connection settings > Private DNS > dns.adguard-dns.com (or dns.adguard.com)\r\n> \r\n> **Actions Taken:**\r\n> The Naver development team has contacted the LG U+ network team to investigate this issue further. We are reaching out to request AdGuard's cooperation as well, as this appears to be an interaction between AdGuard DNS and the LG U+ network that is affecting our users' ability to access Naver services.\r\n> \r\n> We appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/l12z5xty3tsk004k8000skoks8w80wsb2r994pz5r4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/16ho0xijiiw0g4w8gookogko4g4ss0kphwb4855j00.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/sy801lsz4000s8c0s0wgkwcc4s0wcg4dje2wixxao0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/eqnqnc2iq8g8g04cw8o0ksogcg8gg48lnokjgnjwzk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/iadqmo6ipq0wocgkcwggs8o0k8ggk40tpgtxpyimsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/oljxujs1sn4w8swck4okwgow4ssswk0e96d8hnp0f4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/tkvknvqico0gw4880gs0kcokg444woseo1nz2b8zfc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/6s32hb49exgc48k8kcowg04ogowgcowbz4xhkisev4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Android 16`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3728204830","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474#issuecomment-3728204830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474","id":3728204830,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87eN-Qe","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-09T10:02:24Z","updated_at":"2026-01-09T10:02:24Z","body":"Here you are:\n\n<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>\n<p>\n\n<img width=\"1552\" height=\"1091\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/445c5d28-33bf-4419-bba4-5f40765ed84b\" />\n<img width=\"1552\" height=\"1091\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b759a032-f98c-4b2b-afc5-d1bb078fd5d3\" />\n\n</p>\n</details> ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3728204830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2026-01-09T10:02:24Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://m.naver.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.naver.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Hello, this is the Naver Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS (dns.adguard.com) cannot access naver.com domains. We received confirmation from AdGuard support that naver.com domains are not blocked.\r\n> \r\n> As a follow-up, we would like to provide additional details about the ongoing issue.\r\n> \r\n> **Issue Overview:**\r\n> We have recently received numerous reports from customers experiencing difficulties accessing Naver-related services through Android apps (Chrome, Google app, Naver app, etc.) when using AdGuard DNS. Based on customer inquiries and internal reproduction tests, we have confirmed that this issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS in conjunction with LG U+, a major network provider in South Korea.\r\n> \r\n> **Symptoms:**\r\n> * Various Naver services (Naver Search, Naver Shopping, Naver News, etc.) are inaccessible or fail to load properly\r\n>   > For example, when accessing \"m.naver.com\" through mobile Chrome or Google app, users encounter errors such as \"Unable to connect to the Internet\" or \"This site can't be reached\"\r\n>   > Web pages fail to load in browser apps, displaying ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED errors\r\n> * The issue is primarily reported by Android users\r\n> * The problem occurs intermittently (not continuously), sometimes lasting several minutes\r\n> * Our internal testing confirms the issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS with the LG U+ network\r\n>   > Configuration: Phone Settings > Connections > More connection settings > Private DNS > dns.adguard-dns.com (or dns.adguard.com)\r\n> \r\n> **Actions Taken:**\r\n> The Naver development team has contacted the LG U+ network team to investigate this issue further. We are reaching out to request AdGuard's cooperation as well, as this appears to be an interaction between AdGuard DNS and the LG U+ network that is affecting our users' ability to access Naver services.\r\n> \r\n> We appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/l12z5xty3tsk004k8000skoks8w80wsb2r994pz5r4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/16ho0xijiiw0g4w8gookogko4g4ss0kphwb4855j00.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/sy801lsz4000s8c0s0wgkwcc4s0wcg4dje2wixxao0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/eqnqnc2iq8g8g04cw8o0ksogcg8gg48lnokjgnjwzk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/iadqmo6ipq0wocgkcwggs8o0k8ggk40tpgtxpyimsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/oljxujs1sn4w8swck4okwgow4ssswk0e96d8hnp0f4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/tkvknvqico0gw4880gs0kcokg444woseo1nz2b8zfc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/6s32hb49exgc48k8kcowg04ogowgcowbz4xhkisev4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Android 16`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3728444264","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474#issuecomment-3728444264","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474","id":3728444264,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87eO4to","user":{"login":"sewon-jj","id":253913046,"node_id":"U_kgDODyJn1g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/253913046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sewon-jj","html_url":"https://github.com/sewon-jj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sewon-jj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sewon-jj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sewon-jj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sewon-jj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sewon-jj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sewon-jj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sewon-jj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sewon-jj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sewon-jj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-09T11:03:50Z","updated_at":"2026-01-09T11:03:50Z","body":"Hello, this is the Naver Development Team.\nI have something to share, so I'm logging it\nWe confirmed with Naver auth DNS that ECS is ignored and normal responses are returned even for invalid ECS.\nThis suggests the failure happens before auth or due to ECS handling at the recursive resolver/front layer.\n\n@ameshkov \nIf the same query is successful when retried without ECS, the same query is automatically retried without ECS,\nIf successful, we hope it can be processed so that the response can be returned to the user.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3728444264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2026-01-09T11:03:50Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
