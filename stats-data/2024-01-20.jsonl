If you'd rather skip all updates until the next major or minor version, let me know by commenting `@dependabot ignore this major version` or `@dependabot ignore this minor version`. You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.\n\nIf you change your mind, just re-open this PR and I'll resolve any conflicts on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1901902408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":{"id":29110,"slug":"dependabot","node_id":"MDM6QXBwMjkxMTA=","owner":{"login":"github","id":9919,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github","html_url":"https://github.com/github","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"name":"Dependabot","description":"","external_url":"https://dependabot-api.githubapp.com","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","created_at":"2019-04-16T22:34:25Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T13:35:09Z","permissions":{"checks":"write","contents":"write","issues":"write","members":"read","metadata":"read","pull_requests":"write","statuses":"read","vulnerability_alerts":"read","workflows":"write"},"events":["check_suite","issues","issue_comment","label","pull_request","pull_request_review","pull_request_review_comment","repository"]}}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-20T08:00:39Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
