filters to block these ads on MyAnimeList.net:\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> myanimelist.net##.data-koukoku-width;\r\n> myanimelist.net##.data-koukoku-height;\r\n>

I have also cleared my cache and restarted my browser, but these ads still persist. In uBlock Origin however, the filter \"myanimelist.net##div[data-koukoku-width]\" was successful in blocking these ads.\r\n> \r\n> These ads also appear as banner ads at the top of anime pages, such as this one: https://myanimelist.net/anime/52211\r\n> \r\n> Can you please prioritize resolving this issue as soon as possible? It is preventing me from browsing MyAnimeList on my main browser without feeling extremely frustrated. It would still be fine it the ads were relevant to the site itself, but when I went to browse MAL today I encounter this. Any prompt assistance you can provide in resolving this matter would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/KoDuIWd.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.7\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese\r\nCustom filters: | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt\r\nOther extensions used: | Userscripts, and IINA","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149280/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1521645298","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149280#issuecomment-1521645298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149280","id":1521645298,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85asnby","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-25T11:41:37Z","updated_at":"2023-04-25T11:41:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> uBlock Origin\r\n\r\nIn safari?\r\n\r\n> myanimelist.net##div[data-koukoku-width]\r\n\r\nAdGuard for Safari applies this rule.\r\n \r\nPlease try to disable-enable content blockers in Safari settings and restart Safari, and check for filters update.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1521645298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-04-25T11:41:37Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

filters to block these ads on MyAnimeList.net:\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> myanimelist.net##.data-koukoku-width;\r\n> myanimelist.net##.data-koukoku-height;\r\n> myanimelist.net##[class=\"data-koukoku-width\"];\r\n> myanimelist.net##[class^=\"data-koukoku\"].\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Unfortunately, none of these filters seemed to work. I have also cleared my cache and restarted my browser, but these ads still persist. In uBlock Origin however, the filter \"myanimelist.net##div[data-koukoku-width]\" was successful in blocking these ads.\r\n> \r\n> These ads also appear as banner ads at the top of anime pages, such as this one: https://myanimelist.net/anime/52211\r\n> \r\n> Can you please prioritize resolving this issue as soon as possible? It is preventing me from browsing MyAnimeList on my main browser without feeling extremely frustrated. It would still be fine it the ads were relevant to the site itself, but when I went to browse MAL today I encounter this. Any prompt assistance you can provide in resolving this matter would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/KoDuIWd.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.7\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese\r\nCustom filters: | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt\r\nOther extensions used: | Userscripts, and IINA","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149280/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-04-25T11:41:38Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

that we verify every pull request manually, so it may take time to apply it\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### To avoid invalid pull requests, please check and confirm following terms\r\n\r\n- [X]

typos.\r\n\r\n- These two rules appear to be intended to apply to all websites _except_ those where they cause problems, but instead they are _only_ applied to one of the excluded websites.

Fork the original repo and clone *your fork* (since you don't have write\n+   access to the original repo). If you don't know how to do it, please read\n+   [this guide][clonerepo].\n+5.

Please always make separate\n+   branches and commits for different issues and don't mix them in one. It\n+   is easier to manage and review them that way.\n+9.  Push your new branch to your fork. This will create a new branch in your\n+    fork with the same name as the one you created locally and doesn't affect\n+    the original repo at this point.\n+10.
