When AdGuard first gave me the error message, I disabled AdGuard from within my browser for that specific site. Ctrl-F5 failed to give me the page. I then disabled the AdGuard for Windows, and Ctrl-F5 was fine. I then re-enabled thinking it was just a glitch. I eventually came to a page I needed to refresh, and the problem resumed. I then tried to report the error because I've had this problem intermittently for a while. And I got the exact same error message. I disabled AdGuard for Windows and then I was able to send this message.\r\n> \r\nUsername: `@digging4roots`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oshpd219mu8k0gk80wsoggg4s4s8gg4h7d1k5sx8xs.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/p57bvucxg004c4400wk84gs840c8ggsw2lxexv952s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.2.241\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter\r\nOther extensions used: | AVD, Dashlane, Google translate, PDF & Print Friendly, Group Speed Dial, FVD Synchronizer, Force paste","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169711/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-01T10:50:20Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
