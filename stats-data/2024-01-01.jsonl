When AdGuard first gave me the error message, I disabled AdGuard from within my browser for that specific site. Ctrl-F5 failed to give me the page. I then disabled the AdGuard for Windows, and Ctrl-F5 was fine. I then re-enabled thinking it was just a glitch. I eventually came to a page I needed to refresh, and the problem resumed. I then tried to report the error because I've had this problem intermittently for a while. And I got the exact same error message. I disabled AdGuard for Windows and then I was able to send this message.\r\n> \r\nUsername: `@digging4roots`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oshpd219mu8k0gk80wsoggg4s4s8gg4h7d1k5sx8xs.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/p57bvucxg004c4400wk84gs840c8ggsw2lxexv952s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.2.241\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter\r\nOther extensions used: | AVD, Dashlane, Google translate, PDF & Print Friendly, Group Speed Dial, FVD Synchronizer, Force paste","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169711/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-01T10:50:20Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

В Картинках стали оставаться места без рекламы, кое где реклама стала проскакивать. Так же там где никогда не было (на страницах яндекса) стали всплывать окна \"загрузите яндекс браузер\". Страдает и фаерфокс, и хром, даже включённые фильтры внутри браузера не помогают. Те-же сложности(чуть меньше) и пк. Проверено на паре смартфонов разных производителей, и пк. Фильтр через сертификат включён \r\nUsername: `@bestperson-free`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/iyhkrpcz6nks0sgo04kcckwo8w8s8gogy7m670thu8.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/r4vwm3nra0gskcco8o8k8sk0swkco04pe0c9cgn24g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/n5ladsmdufkc0gkokco0o0444084gswtqg22u00p7k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b437qj6fyw0gc8gcwwgo8sk8ggs4wsgs6zfdfw14gg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/glpz499tlzc4gg84o84kgws04sogo8knpw3742der4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.3.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox для мобильных устройств\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.nextdns.io/xxxxxxx/Huawei`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>I don't care about cookies<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Нет","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1873389384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-01T16:24:11Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
