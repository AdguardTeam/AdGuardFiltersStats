搜索引擎默认为百度，从地址栏搜索进入百度界面后，如果点击“百度一下”再次进行搜素，页面会卡死，浏览器任务管理器显示百度网页占用CPU过高；以其他方式进入百度搜索则不会。\r\n> \r\n> 目前Edge版本为129.0.2792.52，128.0.2739.79版本也有这个问题，128.0.2739.67版本没有。\r\n> \r\n> 我开了15个扩展，一个一个关闭扩展试了一下，发现关闭AdGuard或者浮图秀就不会卡死了，但是如果同时只开我AdGuard和浮图秀两个扩展也不会卡死。AdGuard版本是4.4.22，更新时间是08月30日，浮图秀版本是4.44.2，更新时间是09月15日。AdGuard无变化，Edge和浮图秀有更新，我无法得知是Edge更新导致的还是浮图秀更新导致的，所以来此反馈。\r\nUsername:
