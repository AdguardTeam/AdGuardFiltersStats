搜索引擎默认为百度，从地址栏搜索进入百度界面后，如果点击“百度一下”再次进行搜素，页面会卡死，浏览器任务管理器显示百度网页占用CPU过高；以其他方式进入百度搜索则不会。\r\n> \r\n> 目前Edge版本为129.0.2792.52，128.0.2739.79版本也有这个问题，128.0.2739.67版本没有。\r\n> \r\n> 我开了15个扩展，一个一个关闭扩展试了一下，发现关闭AdGuard或者浮图秀就不会卡死了，但是如果同时只开我AdGuard和浮图秀两个扩展也不会卡死。AdGuard版本是4.4.22，更新时间是08月30日，浮图秀版本是4.44.2，更新时间是09月15日。AdGuard无变化，Edge和浮图秀有更新，我无法得知是Edge更新导致的还是浮图秀更新导致的，所以来此反馈。\r\nUsername:

Hi , sorry I don't have the answer .\r\n\r\nI don't know which filters is responsible.\r\n\r\nA strange thing I noticed is that when Adguard was turned on,\r\nno matter how many times I refresh (F5) the Google Maps page,\r\nThe drag function is faule.\r\n\r\nHowever, after disabling Adguard, the dragging function will still occasionally fail.\r\nBut usually after re flash the page (F5), usually can resumes normal.\r\n\r\nI'm starting to wonder if it's a Google Maps bug rather than Adguard?\r\n\r\nSorry I'm not a pro about this , can't provide any more details.\r\n\r\nAnyway , thanks for help
