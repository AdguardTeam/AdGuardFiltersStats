Comment\r\n> Здравствуйте, уже писал про гисметео, так блоки и появляются. Уберите пожалуйста все. Допустим в фаерфокс я могу это сделать, значит и тут получится. Отключение адгуард в фаерфокс не очень хорошая идея(чтобы использовать встроенные плагины), т. к. Яндекс сейчас закидывает рекламой без https фильтрации.
