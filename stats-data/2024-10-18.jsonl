\r\n- After updating the AdGuard filter, I accessed Golf-live and stayed on the site for **10 seconds**, then suddenly the error message appeared. It seems to occur only on iOS Safari.\r\n\r\nWhen the error message appeared, I contacted support, and they confirmed that the issue was caused by the .xyz/fl1hrrg/$popup filter. After excluding this filter, the problem no longer occurred. It seems like it would be a good idea to remove this filter.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4531246-1246-46ba-a483-11ee300f6964)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cebd4837-6d81-41b4-a318-03f83d7fc569)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>When add filter rule</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c5718f6-efc8-40b8-a0ff-2de3a2a7efd4)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/683e280f-bb29-41a2-913b-6d580c2bf170)\r\n\r\n</details>\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/191113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/191113/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2422348519","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/191113#issuecomment-2422348519","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/191113","id":2422348519,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86QYhrn","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-18T12:20:56Z","updated_at":"2024-10-18T12:20:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fixed, update should be available in 2-3 hours.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2422348519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-10-18T12:20:58Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
