Comment\r\n> Although I have AdGuard for Safari installed, and it's consistently prevented ads from popping up before, it's no longer working. I use our family computer so I'm not sure if somebody changed something thats affected it, but I deleted and reinstalled it, and only checked the starting filters, so I don't know if this really isn't possible to prevent anymore or if I'm missing something. Maybe Hulu updated their user agreement and that's changed its something, but I also have this installed on Windows and it works fine, last I checked.\r\nUsername: `@sendhelpthanks`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ka0u6nnpq1w0sc0g0o4gckk8s0owo4oangi67wknog.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.20\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200413/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2737716564","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200413#issuecomment-2737716564","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200413","id":2737716564,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86jLj1U","user":{"login":"jordansworld","id":180710643,"node_id":"U_kgDOCsVs8w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180710643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld","html_url":"https://github.com/jordansworld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-19T18:58:15Z","updated_at":"2025-03-19T18:58:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Alex-302 will send you mine","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2737716564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-19T18:58:17Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

DNS过滤器中，这个pcdn很恶心，影响到不少人了。下面的部分域名出现在上面下载链接对应的软件\n\nws-p2p.pull.yximgs.com^
