Information\r\n\r\n### Deutsch\r\n\r\nSehr geehrte Benutzerin, sehr geehrter Benutzer, aufgrund von Gesetzen ([z. B. die Gerichtsentscheidung in Karlsruhe, Deutschland im Jahre 2018](https://www.morgenpost.de/wirtschaft/article214069831/Karlsruhe-erlaubt-Werbeblocker.html)) ist es leider nicht möglich diese Paywall (Adblock-Erkennung) zu umgehen. Vielen Dank für Ihr Verständnis.\r\n\r\n### English\r\n\r\nDear user, due to a court decision ([eg the court ruling in Karlsruhe, Germany in 2018](https://www.morgenpost.de/wirtschaft/article214069831/Karlsruhe-erlaubt-Werbeblocker.html) ) it is unfortunately not possible to bypass this paywall (adblock detection). Thank you for your understanding.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/177194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/177194/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-19T10:43:39Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

They can be found by:\r\n`document.cookie =`\r\nThey must be replaced by `set-cookie` / `set-cookie-reload` / `trusted-set-cookie-reload` scriptlet rules.\r\n\r\nThere are many old rules, so first you need to check if the site is available, and then the need for the rule.\r\n\r\n* For convenience, you can work in a separate browser\r\n* Retrieve the list of domains, clean up duplicates and check if sites exist (if redirects occur, we assume that the site is dead).\r\n* All such rules can be merged into one file, convert them to exception rules and import as custom filter. Then go down the list and check if the rules are needed (other types of problems not related to these rules are skipped).\r\n* If the site is dead - add domains in the comment below. Then we will remove them from the filters.\r\n\r\nIn order not to overlap with other filter maintainers, it is desirable to perform batch rule replacement via pull-requests (5-10 rules per PR).\r\n\r\n### Important\r\nIt should be checked with a Dutch or German VPN, because otherwise the cookie usage messages may not appear.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2066496145","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756#issuecomment-2066496145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756","id":2066496145,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM857LDqR","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-19T12:43:57Z","updated_at":"2024-04-19T12:43:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Inaccessible domain: `thewirecutter.com`\r\nIf you try to visit, you will be redirected to `nytimes.com`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2066496145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-19T12:43:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
