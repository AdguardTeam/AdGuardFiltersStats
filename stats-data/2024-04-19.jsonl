Information\r\n\r\n### Deutsch\r\n\r\nSehr geehrte Benutzerin, sehr geehrter Benutzer, aufgrund von Gesetzen ([z. B. die Gerichtsentscheidung in Karlsruhe, Deutschland im Jahre 2018](https://www.morgenpost.de/wirtschaft/article214069831/Karlsruhe-erlaubt-Werbeblocker.html)) ist es leider nicht möglich diese Paywall (Adblock-Erkennung) zu umgehen. Vielen Dank für Ihr Verständnis.\r\n\r\n### English\r\n\r\nDear user, due to a court decision ([eg the court ruling in Karlsruhe, Germany in 2018](https://www.morgenpost.de/wirtschaft/article214069831/Karlsruhe-erlaubt-Werbeblocker.html) ) it is unfortunately not possible to bypass this paywall (adblock detection). Thank you for your understanding.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/177194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/177194/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-19T10:43:39Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

They can be found by:\r\n`document.cookie =`\r\nThey must be replaced by `set-cookie` / `set-cookie-reload` / `trusted-set-cookie-reload` scriptlet rules.\r\n\r\nThere are many old rules, so first you need to check if the site is available, and then the need for the rule.\r\n\r\n* For convenience, you can work in a separate browser\r\n* Retrieve the list of domains, clean up duplicates and check if sites exist (if redirects occur, we assume that the site is dead).\r\n* All such rules can be merged into one file, convert them to exception rules and import as custom filter. Then go down the list and check if the rules are needed (other types of problems not related to these rules are skipped).\r\n* If the site is dead - add domains in the comment below. Then we will remove them from the filters.\r\n\r\nIn order not to overlap with other filter maintainers, it is desirable to perform batch rule replacement via pull-requests (5-10 rules per PR).\r\n\r\n### Important\r\nIt should be checked with a Dutch or German VPN, because otherwise the cookie usage messages may not appear.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2066496145","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756#issuecomment-2066496145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756","id":2066496145,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM857LDqR","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-19T12:43:57Z","updated_at":"2024-04-19T12:43:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Inaccessible domain: `thewirecutter.com`\r\nIf you try to visit, you will be redirected to `nytimes.com`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2066496145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-19T12:43:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

chrome for Android will display ads and then quickly hide themselves. The problem lies in video ads, they will auto play and hide themselves, leaving an annoying ad sound that can't be stopped because there's no video to pause. Even if I pull the notification bar to stop the playing notification, it will not work correctly until I reload the website or start playing another video or music. Even that sometimes is not enough because when my overlapped video or music stops, the sound of the hidden video ad will resume playing in background.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/of3tmad5euscgwogsog88gckgskggg8h2a0cfzdzxc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.3.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2066815782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-19T15:30:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Hello. I am Sergey Tkachenko, the owner of the winaero.com website. Some time ago a reader reported me an issue that with AdGuard, they have an empty sidebar on the website. The issue has been resolved by a filter update, but now this happens again. The most recent filter update removes almost everything from the sidebar, including the \"Connect with us\" section with static links to the social media my website is represented on, e-mail subscription, and RSS. I am sure that this block was supposed to be removed, or was removed by bad faith. There is must be some unintentional bug in the filter. Could you please correct the filter and restore the block? It didn't annoy anyone a once.\r\n\r\n3.
