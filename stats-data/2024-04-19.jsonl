Information\r\n\r\n### Deutsch\r\n\r\nSehr geehrte Benutzerin, sehr geehrter Benutzer, aufgrund von Gesetzen ([z. B. die Gerichtsentscheidung in Karlsruhe, Deutschland im Jahre 2018](https://www.morgenpost.de/wirtschaft/article214069831/Karlsruhe-erlaubt-Werbeblocker.html)) ist es leider nicht möglich diese Paywall (Adblock-Erkennung) zu umgehen. Vielen Dank für Ihr Verständnis.\r\n\r\n### English\r\n\r\nDear user, due to a court decision ([eg the court ruling in Karlsruhe, Germany in 2018](https://www.morgenpost.de/wirtschaft/article214069831/Karlsruhe-erlaubt-Werbeblocker.html) ) it is unfortunately not possible to bypass this paywall (adblock detection). Thank you for your understanding.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/177194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/177194/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-19T10:43:39Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
