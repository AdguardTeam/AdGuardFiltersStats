TurboTax has been having issues with reCaptcha this year when importing data from banks and other financial institutions; in my case, the problem turned out to be AdGuard DNS; when I disabled that and flushed my DNS I was able to pass the captcha and download my data as expected.  Presumably there is something in the AdGuard filters that is breaking TurboTax's implementation of Captcha.\n\n2.
