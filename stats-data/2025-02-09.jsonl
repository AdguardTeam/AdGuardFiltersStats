Comment\r\n> При включении dns защиты и выбора dns сервера adguard-dns.io при поиске в google отображается только первые 10 картинок или видео. Остальные картинки не прогружаются.  Отключение расширенной защиты или защиты safari никак не влияет. Смена dns сервера на любой, отличный от AdGuard решает проблему. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pyrqtj0w2yskkgs48k4oocsw08g8c84f6szttjje1s.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/rczefcb40ys4s48c444sc0os8o8soooprfvh30kbms.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.8\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>AdGuard Experimental, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2646016151","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197689#issuecomment-2646016151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197689","id":2646016151,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86dtwCX","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-09T01:38:51Z","updated_at":"2025-02-09T01:38:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://www.google.com/maps/@-28.1779415,137.6297416,4.78z?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIwNS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fmaps%2F%40-28.1779415%2C137.6297416%2C4.78z%3Fentry%3Dttu%26g_ep%3DEgoyMDI1MDIwNS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%253D%253D)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Google Maps on Chrome (macOS) doesn't work properly (cannot find my location even with permissions enabled inside chrome and in my privacy settings in system settings)  with AdGuard enabled.\r\n> \r\n> The issue is as far as my own testing has taken me due to the Filter HTTPS protocol being on.

TurboTax has been having issues with reCaptcha this year when importing data from banks and other financial institutions; in my case, the problem turned out to be AdGuard DNS; when I disabled that and flushed my DNS I was able to pass the captcha and download my data as expected.  (Flushing DNS alone didn't resolve the issue, so it is still active as far as I can tell.)  Presumably there is something in the AdGuard filters that is breaking TurboTax's implementation of Captcha.\n\n2.
