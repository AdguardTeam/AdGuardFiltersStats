Comment\r\n> Примерно неделю-две назад начала появляться реклама в игре руммикуб в случае проигрыша партии. Появляется видео реклама после которой вылазит окно, которое приложил к обращению. Пытался сделать скриншот во время проигрыша рекламы. Но при любой попытке что-либо нажать, сделать свайп - телефон переходит по ссылке на Гугл-плей рекламированной игры. Так что сделал только скриншот окна после рекламы.
