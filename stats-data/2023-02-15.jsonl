I also checked some of those excluded domain and don't see my rule incorrectly blocks something. Only downside is it uses lookahead not compatible with some platforms, but AFAIK the current rules are not compatible with CB too.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that

I also checked some of those excluded domain and don't see my rule incorrectly blocks something. Only downside is it uses lookahead not compatible with some platforms, but AFAIK the current rules are not compatible with CB too.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that
