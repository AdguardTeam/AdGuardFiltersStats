С недавних пор (раньше такого не было) предзагруженная браузером (после его перезапуска) страница на pikabu лезет полностью неотфильтрованной. Причём неотфильтрованной никак. Ни пользовательскими фильтрами, ни подписочными. Запросов при открытии страницы судя по журналу идёт уйма, т.е. реклама как минимум грузится не из кэша. В общем, на ресурсе стали использовать какой-то хитровыделанный трюк, чтобы не так, так так показать рекламу.\r\n\r\n2.

Ни пользовательскими фильтрами, ни подписочными. Запросов при открытии страницы судя по журналу идёт уйма, т.е. реклама как минимум грузится не из кэша. В общем, на ресурсе стали использовать какой-то хитровыделанный трюк, чтобы не так, так так показать рекламу.\r\n\r\n2.

Ни пользовательскими фильтрами, ни подписочными. Запросов при открытии страницы судя по журналу идёт уйма, т.е. реклама как минимум грузится не из кэша. В общем, на ресурсе стали использовать какой-то хитровыделанный трюк, чтобы не так, так так показать рекламу.\r\n\r\n2.
