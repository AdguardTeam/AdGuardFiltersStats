have information about this extension in our blog:\r\nhttps://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-browser-extension-mv3-release.html\r\n\r\n> With Manifest V3 we cannot update filter rules dynamically because the rules are now built into the extension and are only updated with the whole extension. This is not very convenient.\r\n> \r\n> We found a way around this: the new filter uses dynamic rules and provides the most reliable operation of our filters. AdGuard Quick Fixes uses dynamic rules to make adjustments in real time without significantly affecting the user’s dynamic rules limit. It’s fast, efficient and perfect for seamless on-the-go filtering in the demanding MV3 environment.\r\n\r\nMore information here:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension/issues/2964","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2373915717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-09-25T12:14:01Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
