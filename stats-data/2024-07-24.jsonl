Comment\r\n> Примерно неделю-две назад начала появляться реклама в игре руммикуб в случае проигрыша партии. Появляется видео реклама после которой вылазит окно, которое приложил к обращению. Пытался сделать скриншот во время проигрыша рекламы. Но при любой попытке что-либо нажать, сделать свайп - телефон переходит по ссылке на Гугл-плей рекламированной игры. Так что сделал только скриншот окна после рекламы.

Comment\r\n> Примерно неделю-две назад начала появляться реклама в игре руммикуб в случае проигрыша партии. Появляется видео реклама после которой вылазит окно, которое приложил к обращению. Пытался сделать скриншот во время проигрыша рекламы. Но при любой попытке что-либо нажать, сделать свайп - телефон переходит по ссылке на Гугл-плей рекламированной игры. Так что сделал только скриншот окна после рекламы. Готов предоставить дополнительную информацию, если необходима\r\nUsername: `@RomchikL`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bcoju9qaf40084o8kwwk0o8cgs0gkcon32lork0ecg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.5\r\nSystem version: | Android 12\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://xxx.yyy.zzz/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js<br>https://greasyfork.org/scripts/9243-no-yandex-ads/code/No%20Yandex%20Ads.user.js<br>https://greasyfork.org/scripts/19993-ru-adlist-js-fixes/code/RU%20AdList%20JS%20Fixes.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183792/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2247520349","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183792#issuecomment-2247520349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183792","id":2247520349,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86F9nBd","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-24T10:22:33Z","updated_at":"2024-07-24T10:22:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@RomchikL Сделайте скриншоты журнала фильтрации после появления рекламы (штук пять желательно).
