На яндекс дзене постоянно грузит (скрин во вложении) Знаю в чем проблема, а проблема с включенным https-фильтрацией. Началось с 26.04.24 примерно 16:00. До это этого с https-фильтрацией проблем не было версия adguard таже не менялась. Что произошло не понятно. Если отключаю фильтрацию то соответственно начинаются появляться рекламы \r\nUsername: `@Илья`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ot1utmscuvkcgccgsc4404k84wwsggo55xcoh0ci5c.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/gt7ndsmzagoww0k8ck8wck8oc0co0csjiosp17hvso.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.4 Night 38\r\nSystem version: | Android 12\r\nBrowser: | Яндекс Браузер\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nAndroid system root: | true\r\nStealth mode options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Автоматический`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion, <br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Нет","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2081097548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-27T17:06:07Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
