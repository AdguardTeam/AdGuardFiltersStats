Comment\r\n> Although adguard filtered properly in the past, for two days  now ads (probably coming from outbrain, see below) are not filtered anymore in the \"Spiegel\" app. Besides the ads I have also noticed a logo near the bottom of displayed pages saying \"smartfeed\" with the typical blue triangel from outbrain, so I guess the problem is caused by ads coming from outbrain.\r\n\r\n###
