Issue URL (Annoyance)\r\n [http://mangafire.to](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmangafire.to)\r\n### Comment\r\n> I ran into this issue last night and it turns out it redirects to another site every 6-hours, instead of 12-hours. I thought nothing much about it though, so I updated my filters to fix the issue, and I thought it worked but until this morning I found out it didn’t work at as the redirecting issue was still there.\r\n> \r\n> It turns out, the site redirects you if you click onto something like the pages or the ‘Contact Us’ (seen in the image) it redirects to a site similar to the site that you were on, and about 6-hours it doesn’t bother you until about 6-hours the redirect comes back.\r\n> \r\n> I thought this an issue that is already have been dealt with, thanks to the filters, but it turns out it may have missed these small few redirects. I’m not sure filter is meant for blocking redirects, but I’m certain that I have the most essential and necessary ones to prevent redirecting.

Esto es algo que no me gusta y que me molesta!\r\n> \r\n> El otro no es tanto el del cuadro, pero aparece.

Comment\r\n> On Hulu only, while AdGuard does make it able for me to skip an ad, I wonder if there is a way for it to completely skip the ad itself instead of having me do it. It seems like the ad itself is now built into the video on Hulu instead of it being a separate element which would probably make it to where the ad can be skipped fully instead of having it play at all.
