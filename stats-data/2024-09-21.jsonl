Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [https://dooball66x.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdooball66x.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> I accessed the website https://dooball66x.com/ to watch a video. However, I encountered mandatory ads in MP4 format from the following sources before the actual content could be played:\r\n> \r\n> - https://schedule.hunter-news.com/video/ufa191-240822_720.mp4\r\n> - https://schedule.hunter-news.com/video/hydra888-240822_720.mp4\r\n> - https://schedule.hunter-news.com/video/lalikabet88-240822_720.mp4\r\n> - https://schedule.hunter-news.com/video/ufazeed-240822_720.mp4\r\n> \r\n> I attempted to block these ads using the following filter:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> ||schedule.hunter-news.com/video/$media,domain=blackboxsys.net\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> However, this resulted in the error message \"Could not play video\" and prevented any video content from being played at all.\r\nUsername: `@orcath`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/d5ta0jkfwogsosswkcsgw040wccc8so8qqhqibs2k4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.5\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>EasyList Thailand","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/187604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/187604/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2364826981","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/187604#issuecomment-2364826981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/187604","id":2364826981,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86M9GVl","user":{"login":"orcath","id":124774859,"node_id":"U_kgDOB2_pyw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124774859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/orcath","html_url":"https://github.com/orcath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orcath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orcath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orcath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orcath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orcath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orcath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orcath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orcath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orcath/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-21T01:34:58Z","updated_at":"2024-09-21T01:34:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have tested the provided rules and concluded that they will block all advertisements and content.\r\n\r\nContent only plays after the advertisement is finished or when the Skip button on the ad is pressed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2364826981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-09-21T01:34:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
