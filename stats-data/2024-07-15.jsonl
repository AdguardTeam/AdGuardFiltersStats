your attention an issue that is affecting the functionality of my website, animevietsub.. It appears that the filter ||lh.googleusercontent.com^$domain=animevietsub.* in your system is blocking video playback on my site, making it impossible for users to view content.\r\n\r\nThis filter is causing significant disruption to my users' experience and affecting the overall functionality of the website. I kindly request that you review and remove this filter to restore normal operation for our visitors.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n2.
