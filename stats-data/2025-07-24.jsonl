Comment\r\n> When I view the page through the Google app, there are gray areas (ad leftovers). I know that full support is not provided for this application. However, other ads are not displayed on the website, it is only this problem that has emerged recently. The filter update last week fixed this ad leftover problem in browsers. But it persists in this app. The ads in this Google app, I'm not sure, but for iOS, when you add not optimized to the filters, it gets fixed. I think it can be fixed if this is done.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @punisher018\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/eaj12fqiue8kw08wkggc8o00s8gcw881mvwlgsc8zd.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.11 Nightly 8\r\nSystem version: | `Android 15`\r\nBrowser: | Google\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nAndroid system root: | true\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)<br><br>**Browser API**:<br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nCustom filters: | `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@list-kr/tinyshield@latest/dist/tinyShield.user.js`,<br>`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/refs/heads/master/filters/ubo-link-shorteners.txt`\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | `https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3112637374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-24T08:57:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Don't you agree?\n\nAll I'm hearing is that it's a risky change, along with vague statements about \"many\" potential problems but no facts. And if we agree that ref _ought_ to be stripped out by default, then I don't see why the risk should block this improvement, as long as it's done with proper steps in place to avoid as many issues as possible (such as a beta release).\n\nAnyway—since this is clearly an unpopular request, I'll stop bothering you. If others find themselves here, I'd recommend stripping `ref` out in your custom filters and maintaining your own whitelist.\n\nThank you again for your work on this list, I still find it very helpful! ❤️ ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3112904341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-24T10:19:55Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
