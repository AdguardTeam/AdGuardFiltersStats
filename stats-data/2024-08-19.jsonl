Comment\r\n> Hello.\r\n> \r\n> First of all, I would like to inform you that in order to send this application, I had to switch from the alpha version of the Adguard application for Windows to the stable version, because in the alpha version the application form does not detect any settings of my program.\r\n> \r\n> The above report concerns Disney+, namely the VOD platform, when Adguard is active it takes a very long time to load even though according to the browser the page is already loaded.\r\n> \r\n> This makes it quite difficult to use the VOD service on your computer\r\n> \r\n> Additionally, I will add that I checked whether this is caused by one of the blocking lists I use and I can confirm with full confidence that this is not the case, and the website only starts working properly when the entire Windows application is suspended. disabling filtering from the assistant plugin has no effect.\r\nUsername: `@grzenio22`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n

Comment\r\n> Hello.\r\n> \r\n> First of all, I would like to inform you that in order to send this application, I had to switch from the alpha version of the Adguard application for Windows to the stable version, because in the alpha version the application form does not detect any settings of my program.\r\n> \r\n> The above report concerns Disney+, namely the VOD platform, when Adguard is active it takes a very long time to load even though according to the browser the page is already loaded.\r\n> \r\n> This makes it quite difficult to use the VOD service on your computer\r\n> \r\n> Additionally, I will add that I checked whether this is caused by one of the blocking lists I use and I can confirm with full confidence that this is not the case, and the website only starts working properly when the entire Windows application is suspended. disabling filtering from the assistant plugin has no effect.\r\nUsername: `@grzenio22`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n

мобильное приложение СберБанка для Сбербанк Online для Android.  Версия актуальная текущая 15.12.0. Приложение скачано и установлено и обновляется не из какого-то магазина приложений а в виде apk-файла непосредственно с сайта банка. Если AdGuard включен то в настройках в приложении банка в разделе настроек Оформление->Заставки на входе полностью или частично не загружается графика, невозможно выбрать и установить другой набор заставок отличный от того что уже до этого был установлен по умолчанию или выбран пользователем. Наглядно на скриншотах. А если зайти ещё чуть глубже в настройки, т.е. попытаться выбрать конкретный набор заставок чтобы его установить, то там вообще белый экран будет, т.е. не будет показана графика этого набора заставок и не будет кнопки для его загрузки и установки. Если AdGuard временно выключить то всё в этом плане в приложении Сбербанка загружается и работает нормально.\r\nUsername: `@NUser2018`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2rm5ucnk9omcoosc48ksgk0w88w8ww47afuvkoauq0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/gon2kglnbfkgw0cgo0sc44o8k4o4k4on8i4568epz4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.6.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Официальное мобильное приложение СберБанка\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.google/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-19T09:37:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
