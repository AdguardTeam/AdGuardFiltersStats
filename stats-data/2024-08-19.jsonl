Comment\r\n> Hello.\r\n> \r\n> First of all, I would like to inform you that in order to send this application, I had to switch from the alpha version of the Adguard application for Windows to the stable version, because in the alpha version the application form does not detect any settings of my program.\r\n> \r\n> The above report concerns Disney+, namely the VOD platform, when Adguard is active it takes a very long time to load even though according to the browser the page is already loaded.\r\n> \r\n> This makes it quite difficult to use the VOD service on your computer\r\n> \r\n> Additionally, I will add that I checked whether this is caused by one of the blocking lists I use and I can confirm with full confidence that this is not the case, and the website only starts working properly when the entire Windows application is suspended. disabling filtering from the assistant plugin has no effect.\r\nUsername: `@grzenio22`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n

Comment\r\n> Hello.\r\n> \r\n> First of all, I would like to inform you that in order to send this application, I had to switch from the alpha version of the Adguard application for Windows to the stable version, because in the alpha version the application form does not detect any settings of my program.\r\n> \r\n> The above report concerns Disney+, namely the VOD platform, when Adguard is active it takes a very long time to load even though according to the browser the page is already loaded.\r\n> \r\n> This makes it quite difficult to use the VOD service on your computer\r\n> \r\n> Additionally, I will add that I checked whether this is caused by one of the blocking lists I use and I can confirm with full confidence that this is not the case, and the website only starts working properly when the entire Windows application is suspended. disabling filtering from the assistant plugin has no effect.\r\nUsername: `@grzenio22`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n
