Пробовал ставить все фильтры, не помогло, но думаю это и не правильно, ставить сразу все фильтры.\r\nUsername: `@Fantik`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/1jltwf0abmas8wcgkww400cwoscws0ki7ugxh8gcf4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qpmesnwj4e8084gss0sccssgk048gccmttl91b4j5c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oxl9mwtqm8000s8cwow0oc44kcwwo4sgzemsa2muh4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | Private AdGuard DNS server\r\nSystem version: | ASUS RT-AX88U\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nBlocklists: | <b>DNS:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>AdAway Default Blocklist, <br/>HaGeZi's Ultimate Blocklist, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Anti Push Notifications, <br/>Perflyst and Dandelion Sprout's Smart-TV Blocklist","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169866/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-09T08:20:21Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> I had several issues with some websites recently, so I checked which filters I had on. Turns out, Adguard in his stock is offering some lists by default which are no longer supported. Enhanced Trackers List by fanboy, Anti-Facebook Filters, Thirdparty Fonts Filters should be removed from all adguard products, as they're no longer updated and can cause issues.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/7bxjfr93xq80wowg0cck40o8o0808w0hk4g6rj5w9s.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/axqaoui8pyos8ssss40wk880skg48kc8vhrxeggrm8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/p7jy3n14f2sow08wo4g0kksgcw0w0k4bkmn3tlox6o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/l1h2mukk3m8ck4gksckscogs8wc04c0cqlg5kd1yfc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.2.241\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nStealth mode options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>EasyList Italy","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1883037872","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170217#issuecomment-1883037872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170217","id":1883037872,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85wPOCw","user":{"login":"jellizaveta","id":91964807,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXtFhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91964807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta","html_url":"https://github.com/jellizaveta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-09T13:12:46Z","updated_at":"2024-01-09T13:12:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`Anti-Facebook List` hasn't caused any problems lately, I don't think it's worth disabling either if the rules are still relevant","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1883037872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-09T13:12:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
