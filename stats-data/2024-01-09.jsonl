Пробовал ставить все фильтры, не помогло, но думаю это и не правильно, ставить сразу все фильтры.\r\nUsername: `@Fantik`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/1jltwf0abmas8wcgkww400cwoscws0ki7ugxh8gcf4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qpmesnwj4e8084gss0sccssgk048gccmttl91b4j5c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oxl9mwtqm8000s8cwow0oc44kcwwo4sgzemsa2muh4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | Private AdGuard DNS server\r\nSystem version: | ASUS RT-AX88U\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nBlocklists: | <b>DNS:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>AdAway Default Blocklist, <br/>HaGeZi's Ultimate Blocklist, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Anti Push Notifications, <br/>Perflyst and Dandelion Sprout's Smart-TV Blocklist","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169866/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-09T08:20:21Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
