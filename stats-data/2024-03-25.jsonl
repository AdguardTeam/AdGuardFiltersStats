This seems to be an issue for all MailChimp self-registration formulas. Even the formulas in the MailChimp console are bricked by AdGuard and this link is just exemplary. This has worked the last years without issues. We would be really happy for a fix, as this is no ad and a voluntary self-registration for people to receive news.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/sxrhbndwoess00sooock0wko0w4wkswct2ow1fwvy0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pwho4zacj9wsk48g408kocwc8ksssgg3x6i58xdp92.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.16\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175662/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-25T10:55:41Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
