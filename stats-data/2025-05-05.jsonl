\r\n> AdGuard Parental Controls Stop Blocking After Browser Extension Removal (Arc Browser on Windows)\r\n> \r\n> **Describe the bug**  \r\n> AdGuard Parental Controls have stopped blocking websites on my blocklist. This issue began shortly after I installed and then removed the AdGuard browser extension on the Arc Browser (which is Chromium-based). The app’s settings appear correct, but the blocklist is not being enforced.\r\n> \r\n> **Steps to reproduce**  \r\n> 1. Install AdGuard app on Windows PC  \r\n> 2. Enable Parental Controls and add websites to the blocklist  \r\n> 3. Install AdGuard browser extension on Arc Browser  \r\n> 4. Remove the AdGuard browser extension  \r\n> 5. Attempt to access a website that should be blocked\r\n> \r\n> **Expected behavior**  \r\n> Websites added to the Parental Controls blocklist should remain inaccessible, regardless of the browser extension status.\r\n> \r\n> **Actual behavior**  \r\n> Websites on the blocklist are accessible without restriction.\r\n> \r\n> - **Reinstallation:** Reinstalling the AdGuard app did not fix the issue  \r\n> - **Not account-related:** Parental Controls work correctly on my laptop with the same account and settings\r\n> \r\n> **Additional context**  \r\n> - The issue seems isolated to my PC.  \r\n> - I suspect the browser extension may have altered settings that interfere with DNS filtering or parental control enforcement.  \r\n> - Other AdGuard protections (e.g., DNS filtering) still appear to function normally—only the Parental Controls blocklist is affected.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4p99la6y6ku8kkscsgc4gow0gkcc0cc4sc7mvq6gly.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/60k2htzmi9og8gs4wcgg04sc8g0c0c0n7segcpi7es.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/21av4nh8zvr48w44coko04sskkcskckrl2gcse7m40.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ivlhk0rlvv480okssookos84sswgscwk5jfmxalf40.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11, version 24H2\r\nBrowser: | Arc Browser\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS filter`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Ukrainian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant<br>AdGuard Extra<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=AdGuard+DNS+filter)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2850678410","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204426#issuecomment-2850678410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204426","id":2850678410,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86p6eaK","user":{"login":"ntnguyen1234","id":23257168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjU3MTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23257168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234","html_url":"https://github.com/ntnguyen1234","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-05T11:19:29Z","updated_at":"2025-05-05T11:19:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I can't reproduce the issue.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n[NSFW] [https://www.behance.net/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.behance.net%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> **Title:**  \r\n> AdGuard Parental Controls Stop Blocking After Browser Extension Removal (Arc Browser on Windows)\r\n> \r\n> **Describe the bug**  \r\n> AdGuard Parental Controls have stopped blocking websites on my blocklist. This issue began shortly after I installed and then removed the AdGuard browser extension on the Arc Browser (which is Chromium-based). The app’s settings appear correct, but the blocklist is not being enforced.\r\n> \r\n> **Steps to reproduce**  \r\n> 1. Install AdGuard app on Windows PC  \r\n> 2. Enable Parental Controls and add websites to the blocklist  \r\n> 3. Install AdGuard browser extension on Arc Browser  \r\n> 4. Remove the AdGuard browser extension  \r\n> 5. Attempt to access a website that should be blocked\r\n> \r\n> **Expected behavior**  \r\n> Websites added to the Parental Controls blocklist should remain inaccessible, regardless of the browser extension status.\r\n> \r\n> **Actual behavior**  \r\n> Websites on the blocklist are accessible without restriction.\r\n> \r\n> - **Reinstallation:** Reinstalling the AdGuard app did not fix the issue  \r\n> - **Not account-related:** Parental Controls work correctly on my laptop with the same account and settings\r\n> \r\n> **Additional context**  \r\n> - The issue seems isolated to my PC.  \r\n> - I suspect the browser extension may have altered settings that interfere with DNS filtering or parental control enforcement.  \r\n> - Other AdGuard protections (e.g., DNS filtering) still appear to function normally—only the Parental Controls blocklist is affected.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4p99la6y6ku8kkscsgc4gow0gkcc0cc4sc7mvq6gly.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/60k2htzmi9og8gs4wcgg04sc8g0c0c0n7segcpi7es.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/21av4nh8zvr48w44coko04sskkcskckrl2gcse7m40.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ivlhk0rlvv480okssookos84sswgscwk5jfmxalf40.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11, version 24H2\r\nBrowser: | Arc Browser\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS filter`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Ukrainian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant<br>AdGuard Extra<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=AdGuard+DNS+filter)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2850791992","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204426#issuecomment-2850791992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204426","id":2850791992,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86p66I4","user":{"login":"ntnguyen1234","id":23257168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjU3MTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23257168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234","html_url":"https://github.com/ntnguyen1234","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntnguyen1234/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-05T12:09:42Z","updated_at":"2025-05-05T12:09:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@AdguardTeam/filters-maintainers Sorry, can anyone reproduce?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2850791992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-05T12:09:43Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n[NSFW] [https://www.behance.net/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.behance.net%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> **Title:**  \r\n> AdGuard Parental Controls Stop Blocking After Browser Extension Removal (Arc Browser on Windows)\r\n> \r\n> **Describe the bug**  \r\n> AdGuard Parental Controls have stopped blocking websites on my blocklist. This issue began shortly after I installed and then removed the AdGuard browser extension on the Arc Browser (which is Chromium-based). The app’s settings appear correct, but the blocklist is not being enforced.\r\n> \r\n> **Steps to reproduce**  \r\n> 1. Install AdGuard app on Windows PC  \r\n> 2. Enable Parental Controls and add websites to the blocklist  \r\n> 3. Install AdGuard browser extension on Arc Browser  \r\n> 4. Remove the AdGuard browser extension  \r\n> 5. Attempt to access a website that should be blocked\r\n> \r\n> **Expected behavior**  \r\n> Websites added to the Parental Controls blocklist should remain inaccessible, regardless of the browser extension status.\r\n> \r\n> **Actual behavior**  \r\n> Websites on the blocklist are accessible without restriction.\r\n> \r\n> - **Reinstallation:** Reinstalling the AdGuard app did not fix the issue  \r\n> - **Not account-related:** Parental Controls work correctly on my laptop with the same account and settings\r\n> \r\n> **Additional context**  \r\n> - The issue seems isolated to my PC.  \r\n> - I suspect the browser extension may have altered settings that interfere with DNS filtering or parental control enforcement.  \r\n> - Other AdGuard protections (e.g., DNS filtering) still appear to function normally—only the Parental Controls blocklist is affected.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4p99la6y6ku8kkscsgc4gow0gkcc0cc4sc7mvq6gly.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/60k2htzmi9og8gs4wcgg04sc8g0c0c0n7segcpi7es.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/21av4nh8zvr48w44coko04sskkcskckrl2gcse7m40.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ivlhk0rlvv480okssookos84sswgscwk5jfmxalf40.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11, version 24H2\r\nBrowser: | Arc Browser\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS filter`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Ukrainian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant<br>AdGuard Extra<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=AdGuard+DNS+filter)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2850823679","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204426#issuecomment-2850823679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204426","id":2850823679,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86p7B3_","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-05T12:22:52Z","updated_at":"2025-05-05T12:22:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also not reproduced on my end.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://www.facebook.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> 1) Голосові дзвінки Messenger при включеному AdGuard обриваються (автоматично вимикаються ніби хтось поклав трубку) через 2-3 секунди після початку розмови. При вимкненому AdGuard дзвінки Messenger  відбуваються нормально. Цей баг працює постійно\r\n> 2)При включеному AdGuard час від часу (не завжди, 2-3 рази на день) перестає вантажитись стрічка Facebook, а також розділ \"сповіщення\" (той що з дзвіночком). При цьому Messenger та шапка сайту провантажуються нормально. В месенджері можна спілкуватись, але не голосом. За межами цих 2-3 разів на день стрічка та панель сповіщень вантажаться нормально.\r\n> Обидві проблеми почалися одночасно, близько 1,5-2 тижнів тому, до того все було нормально. Нічого в налаштуваннях не змінювалось, нових програм не встановлювалось. Вмикання чи вимикання Adblock Plus ніяким чином на ситуацію не впливає.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/1u8hzj3b3uhw0w4k4k8cwsg0oskskko1387a9nzqe3.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/10ptc6dxg1y8kg488000cg4c0wgk8s0fd08ecrtu9w.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.0.230 MV3\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters</details>\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Adblock Plus, Windows Defender","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2851892847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-05T18:05:43Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
