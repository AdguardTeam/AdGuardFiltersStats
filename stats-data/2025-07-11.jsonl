I don't have a screenshot or picture of it. But this behavior is across the board on all of my devices. I also have an Nvidia Shield and the Peacock app on my android phone. They all were blocking ads, and yesterday we noticed they are no longer blocking ads. \r\n2. I have updated all of my filters and the adguard version. This is currently running on a Raspberry Pi. No changes have been made to my network or devices. So not sure what would have caused the ads all of a sudden. \r\n\r\n3.

I blocked all unknown activity of the camera. The URLs I sent here are the ones that do not break any functionality. There were a lot of others that break stuff.\n\nHere are some exames of domains the camera called that are not recommended to block:\n*.pub-status.secu100.net\n*.int08h.com \n*.ibytedtos.com\n*.example.org\n*.ipv4only.arpa\n*.jfappstore.obs.cn-south-1.myhuaweicloud.com\n*.obs-xm-pub.obs.cn-south-1.myhuaweicloud.com\n*.myhuaweicloud.com\n\nBut the ones I'm sure it's safe to block are:\n*.promotion.xmeye.net\n*.promotion-en.xmeye.net\n*.promotion-quicker.jftechsoft.com\n*.tr.acobt.tech\n\nPlease, add these 4 domains to block list. They are safe to block and prevents a lot of ads to load. \n\n### Privacy\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209132/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-11T11:16:43Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Thank you for your reply. I understand that AI Overview is only blocked in the optional AdGuard Other Annoyances filter, which is intended to disable other nuisance elements. \r\n> \r\n> However, I wanted to ask if it might be possible to at least unblock AI Overview in the UsefulAds Filter – Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotions – since that is precisely the purpose of that filter. Separating the rule from the AdGuard Other Annoyances filter would help users who want to retain this useful search feature without unnecessary restrictions.\r\n> \r\n> I apologize for reopening this thread, but I wanted to clarify my request and see if there might be a way to address it.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://www.google.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Hi again,\r\n> \r\n> Thank you for your reply. I understand that AI Overview is only blocked in the optional AdGuard Other Annoyances filter, which is intended to disable other nuisance elements. \r\n> \r\n> However, I wanted to ask if it might be possible to at least unblock AI Overview in the UsefulAds Filter – Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotions – since that is precisely the purpose of that filter. Separating the rule from the AdGuard Other Annoyances filter would help users who want to retain this useful search feature without unnecessary restrictions.\r\n> \r\n> I apologize for reopening this thread, but I wanted to clarify my request and see if there might be a way to address it. This issue has also been raised by others in this GitHub discussion: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208774\r\n> \r\n> Thank you very much for your time and understanding.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/meonokflmbk4c4sc0oso84o8kgkgkkct7tcyl8bsqs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/r8b0l3mc8askksw8wkgogcs84cssg40fx01k0iltjw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | AdGuard Other Annoyances Filter v5.1.102\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Xfiles","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209061/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-11T12:43:25Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

to block all unknown network activity of Chinese IP cam and it's app. But cannot test, how it will work.\n\nI tested. I blocked all unknown activity of the camera. The URLs I sent here are the ones that do not break any functionality. There were a lot of others that break stuff.\n\nHere are some exames of domains the camera called that are not recommended to block:\n*.pub-status.secu100.net\n*.int08h.com \n*.ibytedtos.com\n*.example.org\n*.ipv4only.arpa\n*.jfappstore.obs.cn-south-1.myhuaweicloud.com\n*.obs-xm-pub.obs.cn-south-1.myhuaweicloud.com\n*.myhuaweicloud.com\n\nBut the ones I'm sure it's safe to block are:\n*.promotion.xmeye.net\n*.promotion-en.xmeye.net\n*.promotion-quicker.jftechsoft.com\n*.tr.acobt.tech\n\nPlease, add these 4 domains to block list. They are safe to block and prevents a lot of ads to load. \n\n### Privacy\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209132/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3062370779","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209132#issuecomment-3062370779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209132","id":3062370779,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM862iBHb","user":{"login":"kelvinkad","id":69553241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTUzMjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69553241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinkad","html_url":"https://github.com/kelvinkad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinkad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinkad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinkad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinkad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinkad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinkad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinkad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinkad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinkad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-11T13:35:10Z","updated_at":"2025-07-11T13:35:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Oh I'm sorry I thought only the name was enough.
