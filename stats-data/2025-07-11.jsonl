I don't have a screenshot or picture of it. But this behavior is across the board on all of my devices. I also have an Nvidia Shield and the Peacock app on my android phone. They all were blocking ads, and yesterday we noticed they are no longer blocking ads. \r\n2. I have updated all of my filters and the adguard version. This is currently running on a Raspberry Pi. No changes have been made to my network or devices. So not sure what would have caused the ads all of a sudden. \r\n\r\n3.

I blocked all unknown activity of the camera. The URLs I sent here are the ones that do not break any functionality. There were a lot of others that break stuff.\n\nHere are some exames of domains the camera called that are not recommended to block:\n*.pub-status.secu100.net\n*.int08h.com \n*.ibytedtos.com\n*.example.org\n*.ipv4only.arpa\n*.jfappstore.obs.cn-south-1.myhuaweicloud.com\n*.obs-xm-pub.obs.cn-south-1.myhuaweicloud.com\n*.myhuaweicloud.com\n\nBut the ones I'm sure it's safe to block are:\n*.promotion.xmeye.net\n*.promotion-en.xmeye.net\n*.promotion-quicker.jftechsoft.com\n*.tr.acobt.tech\n\nPlease, add these 4 domains to block list. They are safe to block and prevents a lot of ads to load. \n\n### Privacy\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/209132/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-11T11:16:43Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
