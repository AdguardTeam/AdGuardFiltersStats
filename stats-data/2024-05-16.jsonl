Comment\r\n> Even with an account at DeepL, after exhausting some pre-defined amounf of requests per day, there's an annoying pop-up that promts to buy a subscription.

Когда Adguard включен, то на сайте https://diamant.ua/ru/catalog/ при использовании фильтров мы получаем страницу без результатов и только при повторной перезагрузке страницы результаты фильтрации видны и мы видим товары.

In my opinion, the presence of the word “banner” in the url is not necessarily an indication that an advertisement will be loaded.\r\n> \r\n> In the commit history I saw that it's a very old rule (https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/commit/7df4ca3a8421caa22944b8751472fc334cac7a4e), so my suggestion is that it be removed, or that it be more specific, rather than creating an exception for this site.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ap0x6hkq61skkkoggwoss8cgw4cw88klktob76olz4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ech64df7hqo88ko08k4w4w8wsc8oowgjs3u3jboz5w.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.46\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179212/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179212/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-16T12:59:15Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Проблемма масовая и касается всех видов устройств т операционных систем.

the Pandectes GDPR compliance app for Shopify.\r\n> We are currently the most popular app for Consent Management on the Shopify app store, and I am contacting you for an issue that our customers are facing on their stores. We have over 30.000 active stores and there is a large portion of store owners that use the \"overlay\"  position for their cookie banner and are affected by this block. The overlay position by design hides the page content by adding an opaque div and blocking scrolling. When the banner div is removed by your app from the DOM, a user cannot interact with the store, and cannot scroll at all, providing a poor experience for our mutual customers.\r\nUsername: `@ZagrebaAlex`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hwsk2ox6heogw88wo0gw0oc0osk8ssg79uug9o4dlk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/cykwv5gh8pc8osk04os4coco40gwcowrfpj2cx4640.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.17\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances\r\nOther extensions used: | None, only adGuard for testing","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2115943855","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360#issuecomment-2115943855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360","id":2115943855,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85-Hr2v","user":{"login":"BlazDT","id":34266271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjY2Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34266271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT","html_url":"https://github.com/BlazDT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-16T18:34:38Z","updated_at":"2024-05-16T18:34:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If all the shops use that url as main page, it is fixed in next about (about 3-4 hours).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2115943855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-16T18:34:39Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

the Pandectes GDPR compliance app for Shopify.\r\n> We are currently the most popular app for Consent Management on the Shopify app store, and I am contacting you for an issue that our customers are facing on their stores. We have over 30.000 active stores and there is a large portion of store owners that use the \"overlay\"  position for their cookie banner and are affected by this block. The overlay position by design hides the page content by adding an opaque div and blocking scrolling. When the banner div is removed by your app from the DOM, a user cannot interact with the store, and cannot scroll at all, providing a poor experience for our mutual customers.\r\nUsername: `@ZagrebaAlex`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hwsk2ox6heogw88wo0gw0oc0osk8ssg79uug9o4dlk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/cykwv5gh8pc8osk04os4coco40gwcowrfpj2cx4640.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.17\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances\r\nOther extensions used: | None, only adGuard for testing","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2116003341","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360#issuecomment-2116003341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360","id":2116003341,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85-H6YN","user":{"login":"ZagrebaAlex","id":81929847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxOTI5ODQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81929847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex","html_url":"https://github.com/ZagrebaAlex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-16T19:11:15Z","updated_at":"2024-05-16T19:11:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"No, not of Course, Each store has it's own main page","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2116003341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-16T19:11:16Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
