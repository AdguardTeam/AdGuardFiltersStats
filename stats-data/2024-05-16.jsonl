Comment\r\n> Even with an account at DeepL, after exhausting some pre-defined amounf of requests per day, there's an annoying pop-up that promts to buy a subscription. Even though it seems to be easily removed by removing some page elements that include this pop-up and the overflow behind it an perhpas changing some properties of some elements. Unfortunately, I got distracted and now my limits are remporarily reinstated, so I can't provide the page code with this popup at this moment.\r\nUsername: `@COOLak`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/d69lhg9f42gc0co00w0g8wc4ckgkkkoqiiv72f8izk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.14.0.1592 release\r\nSystem version: | MacOS Sonoma 14.4.1\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters</details>\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js)<br>AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179055/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179055/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-16T05:27:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
