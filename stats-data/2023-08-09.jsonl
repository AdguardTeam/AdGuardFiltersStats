knowing exactly which of their Ads are the most performing.\r\n> \r\n> Since last week, our users started experiencing several issues with the application, and we found that it was because our hyros.com base domain had been added to the base filters list (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersRegistry/master/filters/filter_2_Base/filter.txt). This has caused problems not only with our sales site (https://hyros.com), but also with our application (https://app.hyros.com).\r\n> \r\n> Since the main purpose of the AdGuard platform is blocking any type of tracking, it makes sense to evaluate blocking our scripts, but the blocking of the root domain is way to broad and is causing issues for users all across our domain. \r\n> \r\n> We have a domain dedicated to tracking, and we would like to request an update of the filter from hyros.com to tracking.hyros.com, so that we can make sure that our application and systems remain functional for users making use of AdGuard.\r\n> \r\n> Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any additional questions or need any other context.\r\n> \r\n> Regards,\r\n> \r\n> Manuel\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/sq6hu49zl68sogkscowcsskscggok8ort4xvjmfwv4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/kwu4jpwpfxck0w4s8oo4csgc0csg4gs7t5kb6lpd9g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158686/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-09T12:47:35Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

This has caused problems not only with our sales site (https://hyros.com), but also with our application (https://app.hyros.com).\r\n> \r\n> Since the main purpose of the AdGuard platform is blocking any type of tracking, it makes sense to evaluate blocking our scripts, but the blocking of the root domain is way to broad and is causing issues for users all across our domain. \r\n> \r\n> We have a domain dedicated to tracking, and we would like to request an update of the filter from hyros.com to tracking.hyros.com, so that we can make sure that our application and systems remain functional for users making use of AdGuard.\r\n> \r\n> Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any additional questions or need any other context.\r\n> \r\n> Regards,\r\n> \r\n> Manuel\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/sq6hu49zl68sogkscowcsskscggok8ort4xvjmfwv4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/kwu4jpwpfxck0w4s8oo4csgc0csg4gs7t5kb6lpd9g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158686/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-09T12:08:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
