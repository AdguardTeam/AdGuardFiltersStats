DNS过滤器\nta.pinduoduo.com\nth.pinduoduo.com\n下面三条规则建议添加到Adguard防跟踪过滤器，你们再看一下图，图中的url是软件为了绕过规则，所以使用IP，我就用这三条规则拦截，目前软件没有异常。url内容中可以看出会上传版本号等等信息，这侵犯隐私，我觉得应该禁止。为了避免以后IP更改导致规则失效，规则应该不包含IP。\n||*d4?appid*type*\n||*/d?id=*type*\n||*/d?dn=*&id*&type=*\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daf635be-04c5-4e31-b231-f2f0b5e6e061)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25762a81-5f43-4527-87f4-45204f05dccb)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9243ab92-d73e-4f77-8fe7-42e26c99d8cc)\n\n###
