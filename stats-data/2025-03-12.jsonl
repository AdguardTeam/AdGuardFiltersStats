DNS过滤器\nta.pinduoduo.com\nth.pinduoduo.com\n下面三条规则建议添加到Adguard防跟踪过滤器，你们再看一下图，图中的url是软件为了绕过规则，所以使用IP，我就用这三条规则拦截，目前软件没有异常。url内容中可以看出会上传版本号等等信息，这侵犯隐私，我觉得应该禁止。为了避免以后IP更改导致规则失效，规则应该不包含IP。\n||*d4?appid*type*\n||*/d?id=*type*\n||*/d?dn=*&id*&type=*\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daf635be-04c5-4e31-b231-f2f0b5e6e061)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25762a81-5f43-4527-87f4-45204f05dccb)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9243ab92-d73e-4f77-8fe7-42e26c99d8cc)\n\n###

It appears not with all the clicks how it previously was, sometimes redirections gets blocked, but I still get a lot of redirections to the ads websites (the second screenshot) when clicking somewhere on the page (clicks on links, clicks on the background, even scrolling with clicking the mouse, basically anywhere). \r\n> Ad guard successfully blocked all the redirections and ads previously, so I'm confused with this one. Probably just stop using the website if it's impossible to fix the problem.\r\n> Thanks in advance for your work\r\n> \r\n> Here is the previous issue description:\r\n>  started ocasionaly get the unblocked ads on the next website (where the ads never appeared before) and the most irritating - now I'm getting redirections after random clicks on the website page, which also never occured before. Redirections are blocked in browser settings also, so I have no idea why that started occuring\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/t6e84g6e9yoswoocwks84oocoocos4si6otf2tcxx4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/36ngowq2xuo080gk0sow8ws4okg4so4ghvs2lwbr14.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.0.206 MV3\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>IndianList</details>\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Тільки  AdGuard","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200636/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-12T11:38:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

had number kaliscan.com #198059\r\n> https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198059#issuecomment-2647552000\r\n> It was marked as fixed, but unfortunately the problem still occures and does not seem to be fixed. It appears not with all the clicks how it previously was, sometimes redirections gets blocked, but I still get a lot of redirections to the ads websites (the second screenshot) when clicking somewhere on the page (clicks on links, clicks on the background, even scrolling with clicking the mouse, basically anywhere). \r\n> Ad guard successfully blocked all the redirections and ads previously, so I'm confused with this one. Probably just stop using the website if it's impossible to fix the problem.\r\n> Thanks in advance for your work\r\n> \r\n> Here is the previous issue description:\r\n>  started ocasionaly get the unblocked ads on the next website (where the ads never appeared before) and the most irritating - now I'm getting redirections after random clicks on the website page, which also never occured before. Redirections are blocked in browser settings also, so I have no idea why that started occuring\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/t6e84g6e9yoswoocwks84oocoocos4si6otf2tcxx4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/36ngowq2xuo080gk0sow8ws4okg4so4ghvs2lwbr14.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.0.206 MV3\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>IndianList</details>\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Тільки  AdGuard","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200636/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-12T11:51:09Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
