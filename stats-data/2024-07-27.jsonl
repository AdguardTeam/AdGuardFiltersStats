I'm using AdGuard very well but I recently found a small problem. If you're using Chrome on iPadOS, you won't be able to use a website content blocker, so you'll only filter ads with a DNS filter. If you browse in Chrome, the first item will show you Google's sponsored ads. The destination of this sponsored ad matches the “www.wavve.com” I was trying to visit, but it seems to be blocked by a DNS filter because of the stopover “www.googleadservice.com”. Is there a technical way to solve this?\r\nUsername: `@MadeByPP`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/cttjkadp2zsogss4080ks4cgkgo4o8kdfnsydsqpds.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jx1xduprcpw0kg4w8g8gco8s88w00o0qlt3uermnr4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.5\r\nSystem version: | IPadOS 17.5.1\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://dns.adguard-dns.com`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>List-KR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/184737/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-27T03:04:42Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I'm using AdGuard very well but I recently found a small problem. If you're using Chrome on iPadOS, you won't be able to use a website content blocker, so you'll only filter ads with a DNS filter. If you browse in Chrome, the first item will show you Google's sponsored ads. The destination of this sponsored ad matches the “www.wavve.com” I was trying to visit, but it seems to be blocked by a DNS filter because of the stopover “www.googleadservice.com”.
