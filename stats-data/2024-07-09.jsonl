ATTENTION\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.

Issue URL (Annoyance)\r\n [http://mangafire.to](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmangafire.to)\r\n### Comment\r\n> I ran into this issue last night and it turns out it redirects to another site every 6-hours, instead of 12-hours. I thought nothing much about it though, so I updated my filters to fix the issue, and I thought it worked but until this morning I found out it didn’t work at as the redirecting issue was still there.\r\n> \r\n> It turns out, the site redirects you if you click onto something like the pages or the ‘Contact Us’ (seen in the image) it redirects to a site similar to the site that you were on, and about 6-hours it doesn’t bother you until about 6-hours the redirect comes back.\r\n> \r\n> I thought this an issue that is already have been dealt with, thanks to the filters, but it turns out it may have missed these small few redirects. I’m not sure filter is meant for blocking redirects, but I’m certain that I have the most essential and necessary ones to prevent redirecting. Because I ran into issue before a few months on another site and by updating the filters solved the problem, but until now for some reason updating the filters didn’t work.\r\n> \r\n> So please do something about the redirects by updating the filters for blocking redirects or create a filter that is specifically designed to block redirects, because I’m not sure which one even says they will block redirects.\r\nUsername: `@Ian Chen`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/e245bcqgp5sgkoc40og0c0owc04wsojodmtjzzqxsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.4\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`, `default`, `(Regular)`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183155/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2216811173","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183155#issuecomment-2216811173","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183155","id":2216811173,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86EIdql","user":{"login":"IC3295","id":142564994,"node_id":"U_kgDOCH9egg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142564994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295","html_url":"https://github.com/IC3295","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-09T07:27:26Z","updated_at":"2024-07-09T07:27:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I updated the app to version 4.5.5 and updated the filters and it didn’t fix the redirecting as it (every 6-hours) sends me to another site.\r\n\r\nThen today I disabled and re-enabled the extension but it didn’t work.\r\n\r\nSorry, I miss-read about the re-enabling content blockers with extensions.

Возникает Ошибка защищенного соединения при включенной функции \"Защита от трекинга\". Проблема проявляется не всегда. Всё может хорошо работать какое то время, но потом опять возникает эта ошибка пока не отключишь функцию \"Защита от трекинга\". После ее отключения, всё работает нормально.

Возникает Ошибка защищенного соединения при включенной функции \"Защита от трекинга\". Проблема проявляется не всегда. Всё может хорошо работать какое то время, но потом опять возникает эта ошибка пока не отключишь функцию \"Защита от трекинга\". После ее отключения, всё работает нормально. Если ее включить снова, то какое то время ошибки опять не будет, но потом она опять появляется.\r\nUsername: `@ Ridik123 `\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8lpg0lp2xx0c8cwgcw8wococ4g4sswkcqja3q2acmg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/kem1ym8ymi8skow8gkkgsw84s0cg08kwxrgp0mhl00.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.18.0 (4774)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.22631.0\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Dr.Web\r\n\r\n### Import issue configuration (AdGuard for Windows)\r\n[Import](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=adguard%3Aimport_user_configuration%3Fbrowsing_security.enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.custom_bootstrap%3D%26dns.custom_fallback%3D%26dns.enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.fallback_mode%3DSystem%26dns.filters%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ffilters.adtidy.org%252Fwindows%252Ffilters%252F15.txt%252CUser%2Brules%26dns.filters_enabled%3Dtrue%26dns.servers%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdns.adguard-dns.com%252Fdns-query%26dns.timeout%3D0%26filters%3D1.2.3.4.17.18%26license_type%3Dfree%26parental_control.enabled%3Dfalse%26product_type%3DWin%26product_version%3D7.18.0%2B%25284774%2529%26referrer%3D%26stealth.enabled%3Dfalse%26system_version%3DMicrosoft%2BWindows%2BNT%2B10.0.22631.0%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.startpage.com%252F%26user_agent%3DMozilla%252F5.0%2B%2528Windows%2BNT%2B10.0%253B%2BWin64%253B%2Bx64%253B%2Brv%253A127.0%2529%2BGecko%252F20100101%2BFirefox%252F127.0%26userscripts%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fadguard-extra%252F1.0%252Fadguard-extra.user.js%252Chttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fpopup-blocker%252F2.5%252Fpopupblocker.user.js%26win.wfp%3Dtrue)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2217382333","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248#issuecomment-2217382333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248","id":2217382333,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86EKpG9","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-09T11:16:16Z","updated_at":"2024-07-09T11:16:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Это не связано с фильтрами.\r\nВозможно, у вас не включена опция для фильтрации сайтов с сертификатом EV (Extended Validation)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2217382333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-09T11:16:18Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Возникает Ошибка защищенного соединения при включенной функции \"Защита от трекинга\". Проблема проявляется не всегда. Всё может хорошо работать какое то время, но потом опять возникает эта ошибка пока не отключишь функцию \"Защита от трекинга\". После ее отключения, всё работает нормально. Если ее включить снова, то какое то время ошибки опять не будет, но потом она опять появляется.\r\nUsername: `@ Ridik123 `\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8lpg0lp2xx0c8cwgcw8wococ4g4sswkcqja3q2acmg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/kem1ym8ymi8skow8gkkgsw84s0cg08kwxrgp0mhl00.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.18.0 (4774)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.22631.0\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Dr.Web\r\n\r\n### Import issue configuration (AdGuard for Windows)\r\n[Import](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=adguard%3Aimport_user_configuration%3Fbrowsing_security.enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.custom_bootstrap%3D%26dns.custom_fallback%3D%26dns.enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.fallback_mode%3DSystem%26dns.filters%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ffilters.adtidy.org%252Fwindows%252Ffilters%252F15.txt%252CUser%2Brules%26dns.filters_enabled%3Dtrue%26dns.servers%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdns.adguard-dns.com%252Fdns-query%26dns.timeout%3D0%26filters%3D1.2.3.4.17.18%26license_type%3Dfree%26parental_control.enabled%3Dfalse%26product_type%3DWin%26product_version%3D7.18.0%2B%25284774%2529%26referrer%3D%26stealth.enabled%3Dfalse%26system_version%3DMicrosoft%2BWindows%2BNT%2B10.0.22631.0%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.startpage.com%252F%26user_agent%3DMozilla%252F5.0%2B%2528Windows%2BNT%2B10.0%253B%2BWin64%253B%2Bx64%253B%2Brv%253A127.0%2529%2BGecko%252F20100101%2BFirefox%252F127.0%26userscripts%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fadguard-extra%252F1.0%252Fadguard-extra.user.js%252Chttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fpopup-blocker%252F2.5%252Fpopupblocker.user.js%26win.wfp%3Dtrue)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-09T11:16:17Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Проблема с данным сайтом, при включении любой серии с включенным Adguard произведение дорожки идёт с микро-фризами (ощущение что реклама пытается пролезть, периодически экран чернеет, потом картинка идет 1-2 секунды, далее опять останавливается и т.п.) Стоит поставить Adguard на паузу , обновить страницу, просмотреть рекламу - и загрузка видео идёт адекватно без лагов. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/iho1jwrqrhkogo040osgkkog84048gwh0y0fjrgojk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2swi7ax4elmogc0oo0kcoskwkow8kw4nh7jiebxpio.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.4\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Яндекс Браузер\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | Adguard Extra\r\nOther extensions used: | Не установлены","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183109/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-09T10:44:17Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Возникает Ошибка защищенного соединения при включенной функции \"Защита от трекинга\". Проблема проявляется не всегда. Всё может хорошо работать какое то время, но потом опять возникает эта ошибка пока не отключишь функцию \"Защита от трекинга\". После ее отключения, всё работает нормально. Если ее включить снова, то какое то время ошибки опять не будет, но потом она опять появляется.\r\nUsername: `@ Ridik123 `\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8lpg0lp2xx0c8cwgcw8wococ4g4sswkcqja3q2acmg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/kem1ym8ymi8skow8gkkgsw84s0cg08kwxrgp0mhl00.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.18.0 (4774)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.22631.0\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Dr.Web\r\n\r\n### Import issue configuration (AdGuard for Windows)\r\n[Import](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=adguard%3Aimport_user_configuration%3Fbrowsing_security.enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.custom_bootstrap%3D%26dns.custom_fallback%3D%26dns.enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.fallback_mode%3DSystem%26dns.filters%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ffilters.adtidy.org%252Fwindows%252Ffilters%252F15.txt%252CUser%2Brules%26dns.filters_enabled%3Dtrue%26dns.servers%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdns.adguard-dns.com%252Fdns-query%26dns.timeout%3D0%26filters%3D1.2.3.4.17.18%26license_type%3Dfree%26parental_control.enabled%3Dfalse%26product_type%3DWin%26product_version%3D7.18.0%2B%25284774%2529%26referrer%3D%26stealth.enabled%3Dfalse%26system_version%3DMicrosoft%2BWindows%2BNT%2B10.0.22631.0%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.startpage.com%252F%26user_agent%3DMozilla%252F5.0%2B%2528Windows%2BNT%2B10.0%253B%2BWin64%253B%2Bx64%253B%2Brv%253A127.0%2529%2BGecko%252F20100101%2BFirefox%252F127.0%26userscripts%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fadguard-extra%252F1.0%252Fadguard-extra.user.js%252Chttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fpopup-blocker%252F2.5%252Fpopupblocker.user.js%26win.wfp%3Dtrue)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2217431743","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248#issuecomment-2217431743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248","id":2217431743,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86EK1K_","user":{"login":"Nikolai1234","id":25442023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDQyMDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25442023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234","html_url":"https://github.com/Nikolai1234","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-09T11:45:08Z","updated_at":"2024-07-09T11:45:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Это не связано с фильтрами.

Когда выключил AdGuard то оказалось что AdGuard блокирует один элемент который изначально накладывается на сайт поверх и требует обязательного выбора со стороны пользователя (нужно выбрать и нажать остаться на сайте или перейти в мобильное приложение) (данный элемент скорее всего отображается сайтом не зависимо от того установлено или нет их мобильное приложение, у меня оно не установлено)... Т.е. когда я временно отключил защиту в AdGuard и обновил страницу в браузере то этот элемент появился поверх страницы сайта и после того как я нажал в нём нужную кнопку чтобы остаться на сайте то он пропал но и страница сайта стала не затемнённой и сайтом стало можно пользоватся... Если повторно заходить на сайт не очищая данные браузера то потом уже проблема не повторяется и сайт работает нормально даже с включенным AdGuard, но после очистки данных браузера и при последующем заходе на сайт проблема повторяется снова... Воспроизведение по этому сценарию всегда стабильное... Москва взята только как пример и город по умолчанию на сайте наверное... А так эта проблема воспроизводится для карты любого города... Нужно бы наверное подправить что-то в каком-то из фильтров AdGuard... Заранее спасибо.

Возникает Ошибка защищенного соединения при включенной функции \"Защита от трекинга\". Проблема проявляется не всегда. Всё может хорошо работать какое то время, но потом опять возникает эта ошибка пока не отключишь функцию \"Защита от трекинга\". После ее отключения, всё работает нормально. Если ее включить снова, то какое то время ошибки опять не будет, но потом она опять появляется.\r\nUsername: `@ Ridik123 `\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8lpg0lp2xx0c8cwgcw8wococ4g4sswkcqja3q2acmg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/kem1ym8ymi8skow8gkkgsw84s0cg08kwxrgp0mhl00.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.18.0 (4774)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.22631.0\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Dr.Web\r\n\r\n### Import issue configuration (AdGuard for Windows)\r\n[Import](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=adguard%3Aimport_user_configuration%3Fbrowsing_security.enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.custom_bootstrap%3D%26dns.custom_fallback%3D%26dns.enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.fallback_mode%3DSystem%26dns.filters%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ffilters.adtidy.org%252Fwindows%252Ffilters%252F15.txt%252CUser%2Brules%26dns.filters_enabled%3Dtrue%26dns.servers%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdns.adguard-dns.com%252Fdns-query%26dns.timeout%3D0%26filters%3D1.2.3.4.17.18%26license_type%3Dfree%26parental_control.enabled%3Dfalse%26product_type%3DWin%26product_version%3D7.18.0%2B%25284774%2529%26referrer%3D%26stealth.enabled%3Dfalse%26system_version%3DMicrosoft%2BWindows%2BNT%2B10.0.22631.0%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.startpage.com%252F%26user_agent%3DMozilla%252F5.0%2B%2528Windows%2BNT%2B10.0%253B%2BWin64%253B%2Bx64%253B%2Brv%253A127.0%2529%2BGecko%252F20100101%2BFirefox%252F127.0%26userscripts%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fadguard-extra%252F1.0%252Fadguard-extra.user.js%252Chttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fpopup-blocker%252F2.5%252Fpopupblocker.user.js%26win.wfp%3Dtrue)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2217522256","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248#issuecomment-2217522256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248","id":2217522256,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86ELLRQ","user":{"login":"Nikolai1234","id":25442023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDQyMDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25442023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234","html_url":"https://github.com/Nikolai1234","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikolai1234/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-09T12:24:34Z","updated_at":"2024-07-09T12:24:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Отключил Защиту от DPI и проблема пока что не проявляется ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2217522256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-09T12:24:36Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://2gis.ru/moscow](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2F2gis.ru%2Fmoscow)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Если работать с сайтом 2ГИС со смартфона через браузер а не через их мобильное приложение, то если AdGuard включен то невозможно начать пользоваться сайтом поскольку вся страница сайта является затемнённой и не реагирует на касания пользователя. Когда выключил AdGuard то оказалось что AdGuard блокирует один элемент который изначально накладывается на сайт поверх и требует обязательного выбора со стороны пользователя (нужно выбрать и нажать остаться на сайте или перейти в мобильное приложение) (данный элемент скорее всего отображается сайтом не зависимо от того установлено или нет их мобильное приложение, у меня оно не установлено)... Т.е. когда я временно отключил защиту в AdGuard и обновил страницу в браузере то этот элемент появился поверх страницы сайта и после того как я нажал в нём нужную кнопку чтобы остаться на сайте то он пропал но и страница сайта стала не затемнённой и сайтом стало можно пользоватся... Если повторно заходить на сайт не очищая данные браузера то потом уже проблема не повторяется и сайт работает нормально даже с включенным AdGuard, но после очистки данных браузера и при последующем заходе на сайт проблема повторяется снова... Воспроизведение по этому сценарию всегда стабильное... Москва взята только как пример и город по умолчанию на сайте наверное... А так эта проблема воспроизводится для карты любого города... Нужно бы наверное подправить что-то в каком-то из фильтров AdGuard... Заранее спасибо.

On iOS (and previously on Mac) there's an error message that just states a problem repeatedly occurred. I've tried clearing Safari's caches & cookies, completely disabling AdGuard DNS and AdGuard and the network filter in system settings and removed all user rules for the site specifically and disabled user filters. The site works (with its profusion of ads) in Safari using a different user account and in other browsers with and without AdGuard installed (I just can't import my settings to AdGuard in Firefox to compare apples to apples). Quitting AdGuard and DNS doesn't resolve the problem either.

recently started, I can get to the main site but no articles will load, the entire page is blank. On iOS (and previously on Mac) there's an error message that just states a problem repeatedly occurred. I've tried clearing Safari's caches & cookies, completely disabling AdGuard DNS and AdGuard and the network filter in system settings and removed all user rules for the site specifically and disabled user filters. The site works (with its profusion of ads) in Safari using a different user account and in other browsers with and without AdGuard installed (I just can't import my settings to AdGuard in Firefox to compare apples to apples). Quitting AdGuard and DNS doesn't resolve the problem either. I've also tried clearing any of  Safari's settings for the site and it still won't load.\r\nUsername: `@Eric Johnson`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/irostwszepwgkgcggogo8sk08kog0kk6hz78rknjvo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bzt4f0gfzj4kok04og80oksccc8kw40aszc3mm48v4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/cv82oa5oic08k04wogcckog0swkogkkncw42na6qkg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.14.1.1603 release\r\nSystem version: | Mac OS 14.5\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/mac_v2/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdBlockID\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)<br>AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183274/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2218147807","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183274#issuecomment-2218147807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183274","id":2218147807,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86ENj_f","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-09T16:32:04Z","updated_at":"2024-07-09T16:32:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi.

Issue URL (Annoyance)\r\n [http://mangafire.to](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmangafire.to)\r\n### Comment\r\n> I ran into this issue last night and it turns out it redirects to another site every 6-hours, instead of 12-hours. I thought nothing much about it though, so I updated my filters to fix the issue, and I thought it worked but until this morning I found out it didn’t work at as the redirecting issue was still there.\r\n> \r\n> It turns out, the site redirects you if you click onto something like the pages or the ‘Contact Us’ (seen in the image) it redirects to a site similar to the site that you were on, and about 6-hours it doesn’t bother you until about 6-hours the redirect comes back.\r\n> \r\n> I thought this an issue that is already have been dealt with, thanks to the filters, but it turns out it may have missed these small few redirects. I’m not sure filter is meant for blocking redirects, but I’m certain that I have the most essential and necessary ones to prevent redirecting. Because I ran into issue before a few months on another site and by updating the filters solved the problem, but until now for some reason updating the filters didn’t work.\r\n> \r\n> So please do something about the redirects by updating the filters for blocking redirects or create a filter that is specifically designed to block redirects, because I’m not sure which one even says they will block redirects.\r\nUsername: `@Ian Chen`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/e245bcqgp5sgkoc40og0c0owc04wsojodmtjzzqxsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.4\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`, `default`, `(Regular)`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183155/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2218762403","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183155#issuecomment-2218762403","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183155","id":2218762403,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86EP6Cj","user":{"login":"IC3295","id":142564994,"node_id":"U_kgDOCH9egg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142564994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295","html_url":"https://github.com/IC3295","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-09T21:28:49Z","updated_at":"2024-07-09T21:28:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Updating filters or re-enabling content blockers doesn’t solve the redirecting issue.\r\n\r\nPlease make some of kind of filter to block redirecting specifically.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2218762403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-09T21:28:50Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
