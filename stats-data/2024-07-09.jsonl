ATTENTION\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.

Issue URL (Annoyance)\r\n [http://mangafire.to](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmangafire.to)\r\n### Comment\r\n> I ran into this issue last night and it turns out it redirects to another site every 6-hours, instead of 12-hours. I thought nothing much about it though, so I updated my filters to fix the issue, and I thought it worked but until this morning I found out it didn’t work at as the redirecting issue was still there.\r\n> \r\n> It turns out, the site redirects you if you click onto something like the pages or the ‘Contact Us’ (seen in the image) it redirects to a site similar to the site that you were on, and about 6-hours it doesn’t bother you until about 6-hours the redirect comes back.\r\n> \r\n> I thought this an issue that is already have been dealt with, thanks to the filters, but it turns out it may have missed these small few redirects. I’m not sure filter is meant for blocking redirects, but I’m certain that I have the most essential and necessary ones to prevent redirecting. Because I ran into issue before a few months on another site and by updating the filters solved the problem, but until now for some reason updating the filters didn’t work.\r\n> \r\n> So please do something about the redirects by updating the filters for blocking redirects or create a filter that is specifically designed to block redirects, because I’m not sure which one even says they will block redirects.\r\nUsername: `@Ian Chen`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/e245bcqgp5sgkoc40og0c0owc04wsojodmtjzzqxsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.4\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`, `default`, `(Regular)`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183155/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2216811173","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183155#issuecomment-2216811173","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183155","id":2216811173,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86EIdql","user":{"login":"IC3295","id":142564994,"node_id":"U_kgDOCH9egg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142564994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295","html_url":"https://github.com/IC3295","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-09T07:27:26Z","updated_at":"2024-07-09T07:27:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I updated the app to version 4.5.5 and updated the filters and it didn’t fix the redirecting as it (every 6-hours) sends me to another site.\r\n\r\nThen today I disabled and re-enabled the extension but it didn’t work.\r\n\r\nSorry, I miss-read about the re-enabling content blockers with extensions.

Возникает Ошибка защищенного соединения при включенной функции \"Защита от трекинга\". Проблема проявляется не всегда. Всё может хорошо работать какое то время, но потом опять возникает эта ошибка пока не отключишь функцию \"Защита от трекинга\". После ее отключения, всё работает нормально.

Возникает Ошибка защищенного соединения при включенной функции \"Защита от трекинга\". Проблема проявляется не всегда. Всё может хорошо работать какое то время, но потом опять возникает эта ошибка пока не отключишь функцию \"Защита от трекинга\". После ее отключения, всё работает нормально. Если ее включить снова, то какое то время ошибки опять не будет, но потом она опять появляется.\r\nUsername: `@ Ridik123 `\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8lpg0lp2xx0c8cwgcw8wococ4g4sswkcqja3q2acmg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/kem1ym8ymi8skow8gkkgsw84s0cg08kwxrgp0mhl00.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.18.0 (4774)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.22631.0\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Dr.Web\r\n\r\n### Import issue configuration (AdGuard for Windows)\r\n[Import](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=adguard%3Aimport_user_configuration%3Fbrowsing_security.enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.custom_bootstrap%3D%26dns.custom_fallback%3D%26dns.enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.fallback_mode%3DSystem%26dns.filters%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ffilters.adtidy.org%252Fwindows%252Ffilters%252F15.txt%252CUser%2Brules%26dns.filters_enabled%3Dtrue%26dns.servers%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdns.adguard-dns.com%252Fdns-query%26dns.timeout%3D0%26filters%3D1.2.3.4.17.18%26license_type%3Dfree%26parental_control.enabled%3Dfalse%26product_type%3DWin%26product_version%3D7.18.0%2B%25284774%2529%26referrer%3D%26stealth.enabled%3Dfalse%26system_version%3DMicrosoft%2BWindows%2BNT%2B10.0.22631.0%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.startpage.com%252F%26user_agent%3DMozilla%252F5.0%2B%2528Windows%2BNT%2B10.0%253B%2BWin64%253B%2Bx64%253B%2Brv%253A127.0%2529%2BGecko%252F20100101%2BFirefox%252F127.0%26userscripts%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fadguard-extra%252F1.0%252Fadguard-extra.user.js%252Chttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fpopup-blocker%252F2.5%252Fpopupblocker.user.js%26win.wfp%3Dtrue)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2217382333","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248#issuecomment-2217382333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248","id":2217382333,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86EKpG9","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-09T11:16:16Z","updated_at":"2024-07-09T11:16:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Это не связано с фильтрами.\r\nВозможно, у вас не включена опция для фильтрации сайтов с сертификатом EV (Extended Validation)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2217382333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-09T11:16:18Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Возникает Ошибка защищенного соединения при включенной функции \"Защита от трекинга\". Проблема проявляется не всегда. Всё может хорошо работать какое то время, но потом опять возникает эта ошибка пока не отключишь функцию \"Защита от трекинга\". После ее отключения, всё работает нормально. Если ее включить снова, то какое то время ошибки опять не будет, но потом она опять появляется.\r\nUsername: `@ Ridik123 `\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8lpg0lp2xx0c8cwgcw8wococ4g4sswkcqja3q2acmg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/kem1ym8ymi8skow8gkkgsw84s0cg08kwxrgp0mhl00.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.18.0 (4774)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.22631.0\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Dr.Web\r\n\r\n### Import issue configuration (AdGuard for Windows)\r\n[Import](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=adguard%3Aimport_user_configuration%3Fbrowsing_security.enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.custom_bootstrap%3D%26dns.custom_fallback%3D%26dns.enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.fallback_mode%3DSystem%26dns.filters%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ffilters.adtidy.org%252Fwindows%252Ffilters%252F15.txt%252CUser%2Brules%26dns.filters_enabled%3Dtrue%26dns.servers%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdns.adguard-dns.com%252Fdns-query%26dns.timeout%3D0%26filters%3D1.2.3.4.17.18%26license_type%3Dfree%26parental_control.enabled%3Dfalse%26product_type%3DWin%26product_version%3D7.18.0%2B%25284774%2529%26referrer%3D%26stealth.enabled%3Dfalse%26system_version%3DMicrosoft%2BWindows%2BNT%2B10.0.22631.0%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.startpage.com%252F%26user_agent%3DMozilla%252F5.0%2B%2528Windows%2BNT%2B10.0%253B%2BWin64%253B%2Bx64%253B%2Brv%253A127.0%2529%2BGecko%252F20100101%2BFirefox%252F127.0%26userscripts%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fadguard-extra%252F1.0%252Fadguard-extra.user.js%252Chttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fpopup-blocker%252F2.5%252Fpopupblocker.user.js%26win.wfp%3Dtrue)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-09T11:16:17Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Проблема с данным сайтом, при включении любой серии с включенным Adguard произведение дорожки идёт с микро-фризами (ощущение что реклама пытается пролезть, периодически экран чернеет, потом картинка идет 1-2 секунды, далее опять останавливается и т.п.) Стоит поставить Adguard на паузу , обновить страницу, просмотреть рекламу - и загрузка видео идёт адекватно без лагов. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/iho1jwrqrhkogo040osgkkog84048gwh0y0fjrgojk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2swi7ax4elmogc0oo0kcoskwkow8kw4nh7jiebxpio.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.4\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Яндекс Браузер\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | Adguard Extra\r\nOther extensions used: | Не установлены","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183109/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-09T10:44:17Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
