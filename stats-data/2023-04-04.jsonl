I put a placeholder link for myself to update later, then went to lunch and promptly forgot about it when I came back to hit the Submit button. I've updated the link now! 👍 Here is a video instead demonstrating the issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4076797/229735020-96ed649f-b091-4aaf-af51-841d56f301fd.mp4\r\n\r\n>I suppose that it's related to this issue\r\n\r\nAhh yes, I didn't see that - can confirm that that exception works! `body` was a red herring, my apologies 😄  Tested both and confirmed that `.NqU4Yg` is the problematic rule. Thanks for fixing!\r\n\r\nDisclosure/source: I work at Canva. I didn't look deeply yet but I think that selector targets the root node for our modal / flyout layer, so it affects all kinds of dropdowns etc. I see that you've updated it now to be more specific 👍 \r\n\r\nAlso as a side note for future cases -- at Canva we use a fairly aggressive CSS classname minifier, which is not guaranteed to be stable across builds. That means that potentially even up to once a day, classnames could change if that area of the code is modified. Apart from the fact that it's breaking other flyouts, I wouldn't trust a selector like `.NqU4Yg` to actually work as intended for more than a few weeks. If it's not too deep in the DOM, a structural / path selector instead of a specific classname would be more reliable 👍 \r\n\r\nWill close this one now, cheers!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1495574899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-04-04T08:38:49Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

email it did not refresh . If I send email it never sends.. if I disable adguard it works right away.. I can't see much in the adguard logs either ..\r\n> \r\n> Also had issues with Android auto so disabled DNS filtering which helped, Ajay issues with WhatsApp not sending images quickly (fiddle adguard and images instantly send) also mygov medicare Australian government app can't login when adguard is laoded due to blocking Google analytics it seems allowed that and seems to be working now... Adguard really seems to be causing some major issues recently...\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/ixBoeaN.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/p6XDNMf.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.11+(54)\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Emsisoft mobile security","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/147378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/147378/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1496000742","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/147378#issuecomment-1496000742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/147378","id":1496000742,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85ZKyjm","user":{"login":"jellizaveta","id":91964807,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXtFhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91964807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta","html_url":"https://github.com/jellizaveta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-04T13:43:19Z","updated_at":"2023-04-04T13:43:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jonno-C Hello!
