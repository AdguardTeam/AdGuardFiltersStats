I put a placeholder link for myself to update later, then went to lunch and promptly forgot about it when I came back to hit the Submit button. I've updated the link now! 👍 Here is a video instead demonstrating the issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4076797/229735020-96ed649f-b091-4aaf-af51-841d56f301fd.mp4\r\n\r\n>I suppose that it's related to this issue\r\n\r\nAhh yes, I didn't see that - can confirm that that exception works! `body` was a red herring, my apologies 😄  Tested both and confirmed that `.NqU4Yg` is the problematic rule. Thanks for fixing!\r\n\r\nDisclosure/source: I work at Canva. I didn't look deeply yet but I think that selector targets the root node for our modal / flyout layer, so it affects all kinds of dropdowns etc. I see that you've updated it now to be more specific 👍 \r\n\r\nAlso as a side note for future cases -- at Canva we use a fairly aggressive CSS classname minifier, which is not guaranteed to be stable across builds. That means that potentially even up to once a day, classnames could change if that area of the code is modified. Apart from the fact that it's breaking other flyouts, I wouldn't trust a selector like `.NqU4Yg` to actually work as intended for more than a few weeks. If it's not too deep in the DOM, a structural / path selector instead of a specific classname would be more reliable 👍 \r\n\r\nWill close this one now, cheers!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1495574899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-04-04T08:38:49Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
