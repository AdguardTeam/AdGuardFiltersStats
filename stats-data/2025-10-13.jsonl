open this webpage with enabled adguard and with my enabled filters of adguard. I use not personal filters here, but without adguard I see cookie notification, I can agree or cancel and use this website normal, adguard blocks the text, but let not close cookie-notification and let not use this website normal. The good solution can be automatically cancel all cookies or accept only technical necessary cookies and close cookie-windows. And if that is impossible, better not block, as make website difficult usable. I hope, you can find any solution for this website. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/4tds3xnxfxq8cgc0oo0gkc00g4o4gk4dyfg19lzqxw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/b1ngjj83ie8gow88gk04w0wkwccgssccsatt73oprc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.139 MV2\r\nSystem version: | `Linux x86_64`\r\nBrowser: | Opera\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880)<br><br>**Browser API**:<br>Block WebRTC\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Germany, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>Estonian List, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>IndianList</details>\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=ext&product_version=5.1.139&system_version=Linux+x86_64&manifest_version=2&browser=opera&filters=1.2.3.6.7.8.9.16.17.18.19.20.21.22.23.105.107.108.109.111.118.203.204.207.208.212.216.218.233.235.238.241.243.249.250.251.253&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.webrtc=true&stealth.strip_url=true&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.third_party_cookies=2880&stealth.block_trackers=true)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214828/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-13T08:40:24Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
