Comment\r\n> Starting last week or so, Publishers Clearing House page auto-progression is broken with AdGuard turned on. Previously, having it on would block all ads and just cause the page to auto-progress (submitting your entry). Now it refuses to leave the page seen in the screenshots. All tested browsers with AdGuard on cause this problem. Turning it off in Opera assaults you with ads (and fixes the progression block), but turning it off in Safari doesn’t actually disable it. For whatever reason.

Previously, having it on would block all ads and just cause the page to auto-progress (submitting your entry). Now it refuses to leave the page seen in the screenshots. All tested browsers with AdGuard on cause this problem. Turning it off in Opera assaults you with ads (and fixes the progression block), but turning it off in Safari doesn’t actually disable it. For whatever reason. Anyway, it’s a problem with the page not being fed the correct information to trick it into thinking “oh, he watched the ad; now I go to the next page.”\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qs89lb4p94gsk0c4ck00wcso4k44kg8lw77h9qnnj4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qqexu7jhqv4wsckgsk8ckkc80wgkcccjujob9rb4hc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.20\r\nSystem version: | MacOS 15.3.1\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201751/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-26T16:33:32Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
