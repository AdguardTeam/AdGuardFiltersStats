Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://online.sberbank.ru/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fonline.sberbank.ru%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Официальное мобильное приложение СберБанка для Сбербанк Online для Android.  Версия актуальная текущая 15.12.0. Приложение скачано и установлено и обновляется не из какого-то магазина приложений а в виде apk-файла непосредственно с сайта банка. Если AdGuard включен то в настройках в приложении банка в разделе настроек Оформление->Заставки на входе полностью или частично не загружается графика, невозможно выбрать и установить другой набор заставок отличный от того что уже до этого был установлен по умолчанию или выбран пользователем. Наглядно на скриншотах. А если зайти ещё чуть глубже в настройки, т.е. попытаться выбрать конкретный набор заставок чтобы его установить, то там вообще белый экран будет, т.е. не будет показана графика этого набора заставок и не будет кнопки для его загрузки и установки. Если AdGuard временно выключить то всё в этом плане в приложении Сбербанка загружается и работает нормально.\r\nUsername: `@NUser2018`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2rm5ucnk9omcoosc48ksgk0w88w8ww47afuvkoauq0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/gon2kglnbfkgw0cgo0sc44o8k4o4k4on8i4568epz4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.6.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Официальное мобильное приложение СберБанка\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.google/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2324376666","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186217#issuecomment-2324376666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186217","id":2324376666,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86Kiyxa","user":{"login":"NUser2018","id":43743908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQzOTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43743908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018","html_url":"https://github.com/NUser2018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-02T10:24:39Z","updated_at":"2024-09-02T10:24:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Sergey-Lyapin и @zloyden у меня вот так поскольку я ещё использую и Adguard VPN помимо блокировщика рекламы.
