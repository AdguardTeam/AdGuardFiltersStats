Your comment\r\n\r\nWe should try our best for iOS and CB user. I crafted these rules with CB on Yandex browser as I don't have an iOS device, please test with iOS Free. `##a[href*=\".xyz/\"] > img[src*=\"html-load.com\"]` is made generic only because it works

visit a website and select YouTube from the quick links, sometimes when I’m browsing videos, channels, or the top page, clicking on links will open them in a new tab instead of the same one. When I check the original tab, an ad site has opened there. The destinations vary, but the original URL is as follows:\r\n> ```\r\n> https://p23hxejm1.com//CPR/CPR.php?c=1843194\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> And there is the list of redirects\r\n> ```\r\n> https://vpn-center.com/cdu/ww/index.php?p1=https://click.vpn-center.com&p2=https://click.vpn-center.com/click&zoneid=1843194&connection_type=other\r\n> \r\n> https://gamdom.com/?utm_source=propellerads&utm_medium=paid\r\n> \r\n> https://ak.ptailadsol.net/4/6280799\r\n> \r\n> https://v.qiepian.vip/a/?code=QOgz0kM0WK\r\n> \r\n> https://p23hxejm1.com/r/dir?zoneid=1843194&pb=8a5ed67ac74da11ec8711dc92c75d4171724251476&psp=aosbZquUoWnIMKmW2g3EjoVTVurHhQbkoR_x36SXMNAJl4LdUHjzlpUobaWL5MWfSuUMi8GUMGDdd-TEOgc5XzsrL7rpgT565lDRcNwSjxdnQW9dRv-W-GoWr18_mMaJYUXWcPMdS0Y1IzV-cs2Kf66k-PBRNz5U6D0mLL9O1N55FnUTlCKgHUsyqwEUvIXQca-xToo2c4pLLvt2dXoWhjPv9AHiEt1djfPKrC_un9c5XUzWnSnzW_1avatabFnUMqrLok9fM3zm60C_E52rzYCfJRRX-zBUXCOxb8CNXpectOwyzVsQcoYgGk7idd0zjitvEoOwBJdk7rJeGgkU1BP6245obf1BluOC6smxo5ltrGxKLQ==&fdl=1&nojs=0&abvar=0&febuild=1.0.314&t=1&wcks=1&wgl=1&cnvs=1&os=-540\r\n> \r\n> https://fulliosdefense.com/landers/valid-vpn/lp11/index.php?lpkey=1701240627f2567738\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> I don't think you can access it anymore since it has expired, but when I look at my browser history, I can see that I was redirected from this URL.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> https://208.87.241.75/channel/UCsBoll12QILGTkmQ4PSttkw?__cpo=aHR0cHM6Ly9tLnlvdXR1YmUuY29t\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186904\r\n> \r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/5cosa9p584kkwc4808k4sggo48g088sd972x6e1xlw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.5\r\nSystem version: | 17.6\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186928/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-22T16:23:03Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
