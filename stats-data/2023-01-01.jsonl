Recently, TitanTV has gotten aggressive with their anti-adblocker tatics.  I used to be able to block the pop-up, and it still works in most regards.  I.e., it eliminates all the ads, however, a few seconds after the webpage loads with the ads blocked, the scroll bar on the right disappears and the screen becomes locked.  \r\n> The scroll bar would disappear and the screen would lock whenever the anti-adblocker warning would pop up.  I wonder if there isn't some residual code that is continuing to \"pop-up\" and lock the screen even though the dialog box and warning text have been successfully blocked.\r\n> I've experimented with 'maximizing' the blocked element and a few times I WAS able to completely block the pop-up and prevent the screen from locking.  However, I am no longer able to make it work.  Please help.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/J82PmAW.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | EdgeChromium\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/138875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/138875/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-01-01T09:16:35Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Have used TitanTV for years with AdBlock enabled.  Recently, TitanTV has gotten aggressive with their anti-adblocker tatics.  I used to be able to block the pop-up, and it still works in most regards.  I.e., it eliminates all the ads, however, a few seconds after the webpage loads with the ads blocked, the scroll bar on the right disappears and the screen becomes locked.  \r\n> The scroll bar would disappear and the screen would lock whenever the anti-adblocker warning would pop up.  I wonder if there isn't some residual code that is continuing to \"pop-up\" and lock the screen even though the dialog box and warning text have been successfully blocked.\r\n> I've experimented with 'maximizing' the blocked element and a few times I WAS able to completely block the pop-up and prevent the screen from locking.  However, I am no longer able to make it work.  Please help.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/J82PmAW.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | EdgeChromium\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/138875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/138875/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-01-01T12:13:44Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Anti Adblock Script)\r\n [https://titantv.com/default.aspx](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftitantv.com%2Fdefault.aspx)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Have used TitanTV for years with AdBlock enabled.  Recently, TitanTV has gotten aggressive with their anti-adblocker tatics.  I used to be able to block the pop-up, and it still works in most regards.  I.e., it eliminates all the ads, however, a few seconds after the webpage loads with the ads blocked, the scroll bar on the right disappears and the screen becomes locked.  \r\n> The scroll bar would disappear and the screen would lock whenever the anti-adblocker warning would pop up.  I wonder if there isn't some residual code that is continuing to \"pop-up\" and lock the screen even though the dialog box and warning text have been successfully blocked.\r\n> I've experimented with 'maximizing' the blocked element and a few times I WAS able to completely block the pop-up and prevent the screen from locking.  However, I am no longer able to make it work.  Please help.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/J82PmAW.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | EdgeChromium\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/138875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/138875/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1368430259","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/138875#issuecomment-1368430259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/138875","id":1368430259,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85RkJaz","user":{"login":"BlazDT","id":34266271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjY2Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34266271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT","html_url":"https://github.com/BlazDT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-01T12:13:43Z","updated_at":"2023-01-01T12:13:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please enable our Annoyances filter and update.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1368430259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-01-01T12:13:43Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
