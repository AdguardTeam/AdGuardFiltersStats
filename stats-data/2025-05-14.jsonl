Hello! I've encountered some issues while using AdGuard and hope they can be improved. I'm using Android 15.0 on my phone, and the following apps have ads that AdGuard fails to block effectively:   1. iQIYI (Version 16.4.7): There are long pre - roll ads before video playback, mid - roll ads during playback, and ads on some film and TV recommendation pages.   2. Douyin (Version 34.3.0): Advertisement videos are interspersed in the video feed, and ad recommendations sometimes appear on the search results page.   3. X (Version 10.96.0 - release.0): Advertisement tweets show up in the home feed, and there are ad spaces on the sidebar.   4. Uptodown App Store (Version 6.66): There are ads on the app recommendation page.   5. Kuaishou (Version 13.4.10.41735): Ads are displayed on the video recommendation page and personal homepage, and ads may also pop up during live broadcasts.   6. QQ Browser (Version 16.3.0.0033): There are ads on the new tab page and search results page, and some ads cannot be blocked while browsing web pages.   7. TikTok (Version 39.8.4): Similar to Douyin, there are ads on the video feed and search results pages.   8. Tencent Video (Version 9.01.20.29991): There are ads before, during, and after video playback, and there are also a small number of promotional ads in VIP - exclusive content.   9. Youku Video (Version 11.1.38): Ads are frequent before and during video playback, and there are also ads on the drama details page.   10. Browser (Version 40.9.10.1_bdc29ce_250509): Some web ads cannot be blocked while browsing.   11. Weibo (Version 15.5.0): Ads are interspersed in the home feed, and there are also ads on topic pages and search results pages.   12. Facebook (Version 512.0.0.64.75): Promotional posts often appear in the news feed, and there are ad spaces on the sidebar.   13. Instagram (Version 379.1.0.43.80): Sponsored content ads appear in the user feed, and ad recommendations may also be on the explore page.   14. Threads (Version 380.0.0.45.88): Currently, ads have started to appear in the content feed, affecting the user experience.   15. YouTube (Version 20.18.34): There are many pre - roll ads, mid - roll ads during video playback, and ads on the video recommendation page.   16. QQ Mail (Version 7.0.3): There may be advertising emails in the mail list, and ads are also displayed on some function pages.   17. Gmail (Version 2025.04.27.755574423.Release): Ads appear on the sidebar of the mail list and other positions.   18. Google Play Store (Version 46.0.19 - 31 [0] [PR] 751509063): There are promotional ads on app recommendation and ranking pages.   Hope the AdGuard team can optimize and improve the ad - blocking for these apps to enhance the user experience. Thank you very much!

help in advance! Essentially, every couple of seconds, a tab/pop-up opens whenever I click something on this website. This could be whenever I click into a new show, or the search button, or even when clicking the pause/full-screen button. This issue has only started happening recently.\r\n> \r\n> Any steps you need to do to recreate this is to just open the website. I start getting the popups a few seconds later after opening the website.\r\n> \r\n> Thanks again for your help.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/kdjf0ro2j0g4s8o4k48scg0oso08o4w13484w1ed0i.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.8\r\nSystem version: | MacOS Ventura 13.2\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese\r\nOther extensions used: | AdGuard is my only extension","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2878893814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-14T06:50:03Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

This is highly annoying.\n\nAs an example, see https://chipsandcheese.com or https://www.noahpinion.blog/.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nCurrently there is a few Substacks in the filter lists that remove this pop-over.\nIt would be nice to replace this with a global filter rule added to the `Annoyance filter` (under the `Pop-ups` or `Other Annoyances` subfilter) , removing the pop-over for every substack page.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/203243/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/203243/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2879367327","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/203243#issuecomment-2879367327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/203243","id":2879367327,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86rn6if","user":{"login":"krystian3w","id":35370833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzcwODMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35370833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w","html_url":"https://github.com/krystian3w","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-14T08:52:10Z","updated_at":"2025-05-14T08:52:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's possible that this popup has already been cut off by @rakleed:\n\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pulls?q=is%3Apr+substack+is%3Aclosed+author%3Arakleed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2879367327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-14T08:52:11Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
