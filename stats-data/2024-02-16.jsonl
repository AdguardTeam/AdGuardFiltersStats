cases, it's a sporadic thing, like at `vg.no` (see reports above).\r\nI assume that they might keep an IP database, or something, so once the connection has gone through, it won't try to reconnect to it (at least for a while).\r\nAnyway, this is _definitely_ not the case for me at `gamingbible.com`..\r\nThe connection to `privacy-mgmt.com/mms` occurs _every_ time, and if it's blocked, the embedded

Comment\r\n> When I try to open certain articles from my Discover feed, I will get one of two things. Either a solid blank white page, or a pop-up telling me that and ad blocker has been detected. Everything automatically opens in Google but if I click the three dots in the upper right hand side of the article and ask to open in chrome, I get the same exact thing. Either the blank white page or the pop-up. It is not every article on the Discover feed but it happens almost every day with multiple articles.

Comment\r\n> When I try to open certain articles from my Discover feed, I will get one of two things. Either a solid blank white page, or a pop-up telling me that and ad blocker has been detected. Everything automatically opens in Google but if I click the three dots in the upper right hand side of the article and ask to open in chrome, I get the same exact thing. Either the blank white page or the pop-up. It is not every article on the Discover feed but it happens almost every day with multiple articles. This is been going on for about 4 months.\r\nUsername: `@Kjw198`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/9nt7jgucp1wc4o8swcww0wkssssos8of7eovj5nn9s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oql4c5eckdw84wgc4cksk8o8480c0841ven2q1w1kp.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.3.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Eset security ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172739/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-16T12:16:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
