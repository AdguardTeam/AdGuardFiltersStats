that if I search for certain content, I end up with a blank page.  The search results will briefly flash on the screen before the page goes blank.  After doing a bunch of random searches, it seems this is only an issue when searching for TV shows or movies.  If I search for a person, place or thing, I have not had any issues.  When Adguard is off, I have no issues.  \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/e4kLTtT.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/3421g1l.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.11\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | proxy\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nUserscripts: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1519845298","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512#issuecomment-1519845298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512","id":1519845298,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85alv-y","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-24T10:13:41Z","updated_at":"2023-04-24T10:13:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@herr-el Hmm.

that if I search for certain content, I end up with a blank page.  The search results will briefly flash on the screen before the page goes blank.  After doing a bunch of random searches, it seems this is only an issue when searching for TV shows or movies.  If I search for a person, place or thing, I have not had any issues.  When Adguard is off, I have no issues.  \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/e4kLTtT.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/3421g1l.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.11\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | proxy\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nUserscripts: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1520015710","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512#issuecomment-1520015710","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512","id":1520015710,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85amZle","user":{"login":"herr-el","id":131377267,"node_id":"U_kgDOB9Socw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131377267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el","html_url":"https://github.com/herr-el","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-24T11:59:06Z","updated_at":"2023-04-24T11:59:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Alex-302: checked, no filter enables functionality.\r\nOver the weekend I checked other options in AdGuard and it seems, that by disabling _Automatically filter applications_ either completely or just for Safari, solves the issue (see screenshots)\r\nInterestingly, when having this still enabled for Chrome (see second screenshot), Chrome can follow links on Google normally. \r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"644\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 13 53 43\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/131377267/233989285-d756e9b1-7921-4e97-955b-ab6259c7a92c.png\">\r\n<img width=\"403\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 13 57 03\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/131377267/233989765-666ed7c5-c41c-4ce0-9541-bde12a8f54b5.png\">\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1520015710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-04-24T11:59:07Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
