I have tried reloading and ads show up. When I have tried reloading other videos such as Introducing LEGO Braille Bricks – Play with Braille by Lego official, and the official audio for The Wrong Girl (Greatest Hits Version) by Lee Ann Womack Official the ads are not there. This seems to be contained to this specific video.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ghclp6szi9s0c8woscogs0w80og0ggsds7aguah22o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tfx68g4v7tw4wkkg0g0s44go0o88sc4dmcps04vezs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nOther extensions used: | Duck Duck Go Privacy Essentials, Return Youtube Disklike Button, Youtube-shorts block, CustomTube, and Replace Youtube's Home with Subscriptions","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1702923445","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932#issuecomment-1702923445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932","id":1702923445,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lgIy1","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-01T15:21:01Z","updated_at":"2023-09-01T15:21:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://www.youtube.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> I didn't include the full browser window, since I want some of the information to remain private - but both screenshots show the title page of www.youtube.com, one with AdGuard enabled and one with it disabled.

Comment\r\n> This is a new report because the previous report ticket was closed without solving (the last link report is https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160591).\r\n> \r\n> I don't know why @zloyden can't reproduce it on his/her end. But I followed his/her suggestion and disabled 3rd's filters except Adguard and ABPVN filters.\r\n> \r\n> Besides, when I tested on https://adguard.com/en/test.html, it has been \"not running\" for all. Is it normal? I still see the AdGuard statistics work, they still count up. But it can't block ads at https://animetvn2.com.\r\n> \r\n> I'm using AdGuard Mac App + AdGuard Browser Assistant, and the link in my report for the Vietnamese market. Please make sure to use a VPN or something like that for the reproduction.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6lhdkwhkubs4gs4k0w4kcwo0w0cgcssr12aq56rpj4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.11.0.1292 release\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>ABPVN List\r\nUserscripts: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1703026699/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-01T16:40:13Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
