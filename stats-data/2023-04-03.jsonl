eksisozluk.com domain was updated to eksisozluk2023.com due to the recent government block to the website. Now eksisozluk.com redirects to eksisozluk2023.com so the old website specific filters do not work, such as a double clicking problem due to a certain ad class. It is uncertain what the owners will do when the government blocks this domain as well, but for now, replacing eksisozluk.com with eksisozluk2023.com should be enough.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/BufB9oH.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | uBlock Origin\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Turkish\r\nOther extensions used: | uBlock Origin","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/147321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/147321/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-04-03T14:45:12Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
