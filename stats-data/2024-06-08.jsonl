thanks for the additional info before.  Glad to hear that the DNS dashboard UI is similar to the browser extension.  It's only occasionally that I run into a blocked site like the one mentioned above though ([www.quintadelarosa.com](https://www.quintadelarosa.com/)).\r\n\r\nBut just this past week I've run into a major nuisance w/ AdGuard DNS, where it now prevents me from unsubbing from marketing email lists (none of which were spam).  The last 5 I tried were blocked, and they all direct to this same site in order  to process the request: https://trk.klclick.com/.  It appears that the majority of legitimate small businesses use this site for mailing list management.  And this never happened to me before until this week.\r\n\r\nDid you just update something with this site?  There’s no way to unblock the ability to unsubscribe?  I mean who doesn’t want to be able to remove their address from these unsolicited promo lists?  It's such a universal need.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2155813614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-08T05:13:39Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
