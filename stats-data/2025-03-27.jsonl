Though blocking pemsrv.com prevents Gelbooru from opening an actual advertisement for a popunder, it creates another tab containing the page you're currently in, which is an annoying advertisement leftover.\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [x] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [ ] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [x] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\nI don't know if there is any, I just noticed this today. This explains the issue well enough.\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\n#### If possible, a screenshot of a page or application should not be cropped too much.

Add screenshots of the problem. You can drag and drop images or paste them from clipboard\r\n\r\n    Use `<details> </details>` tag to hide screenshots under the spoiler;\r\n\r\n2. Describe the issue in detail until it is absolutely clear from the screenshot what the problem is\r\n\r\n    You can also indicate any other information that you think the developers should know.\r\n\r\n**Warning:** Please remove personal information before uploading screenshots!\r\n\r\n1.

\nWe’ve received reports from our clients and their users indicating that domains associated with our service, particularly [sdk-v2.conscent.in](http://sdk-v2.conscent.in/), are being blocked by AdGuard.\n\nThis subdomain is part of our platform, Conscent.in, which provides subscription infrastructure and paywall solutions for digital publishers. The SDK is used solely to enable secure and seamless access to premium content, and does not engage in ad tracking or any behavior that might warrant filtering.\n\nCould you please confirm if [sdk-v2.conscent.in](http://sdk-v2.conscent.in/) is currently on any AdGuard blocklists?\n\nIf so, we’d appreciate your help in understanding the reason, and if there are specific guidelines or steps we need to follow to have it reviewed and potentially removed.
