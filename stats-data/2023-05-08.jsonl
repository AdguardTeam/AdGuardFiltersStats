is nothing wrong in opening PR here, it's completely personal choice whether to opne a PR in EL or in AG. EL has very different filter preferences and decesion policy, so you will be confused until you get accustomed to. If you're thinking to do so in EL, here some advice:\r\n\r\n- make rules as compact as possbile within a safe range (you see I trimmed down the last underscore in `##div[class^=\"NewWatchingDiscovery__adSection\"]`)\r\n- if a css selector is very likely to be unique to ad and is a form of `##.class` or `###id`, they prefer makeing it generic filter than site-specific. Similar thing holds on network rule too.\r\n- carefully check their file structure: adult sites have dedicated files, pure ad servers and other third-party servers serving ads are separated (corresponding to adservers.txt and thirdparty.txt each), revolving adservers are added without `$third-party`, cosmetic filters are sorted by ASCII code of the rule body than its domain etc.\r\n- Even if you did everything right, sometimes your PR may never be merged. Nobody other than them knows why.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1538270393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-08T12:21:01Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
