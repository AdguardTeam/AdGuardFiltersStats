This is a new issue I haven't had until today with MacRumors. When I open the web, no images are shown. If I close Safari and open it again, the images remain lost. If I disable AdGuard, all the content from the web page returns. There must be something you or the MacRumors developers have changed that prevents the pics to be shown. Please, investigate it. Thank you. Best. Antonio\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/9kel6q8wu6g4s044g4wksgkkoocow0sazpwaj7cu94.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/dzo9a8ju568sk0s4s00owok4w0o8c8o8z6ldsbkv84.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Mini for Mac v2.0.3.928\r\nSystem version: | `MacOS 26.2 (Compilación 25C56)`\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese\r\nFilters last update: | December 13, 2025 at 00:51\r\nOther extensions used: | `Ninguna`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/219953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/219953/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-12-19T10:51:51Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

This is a new issue I haven't had until today with MacRumors. When I open the web, no images are shown. If I close Safari and open it again, the images remain lost. If I disable AdGuard, all the content from the web page returns. There must be something you or the MacRumors developers have changed that prevents the pics to be shown. Please, investigate it. Thank you. Best. Antonio\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/9kel6q8wu6g4s044g4wksgkkoocow0sazpwaj7cu94.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/dzo9a8ju568sk0s4s00owok4w0o8c8o8z6ldsbkv84.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Mini for Mac v2.0.3.928\r\nSystem version: | `MacOS 26.2 (Compilación 25C56)`\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese\r\nFilters last update: | December 13, 2025 at 00:51\r\nOther extensions used: | `Ninguna`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/219953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/219953/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3674588094","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/219953#issuecomment-3674588094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/219953","id":3674588094,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87bBcO-","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-12-19T10:51:48Z","updated_at":"2025-12-19T10:51:48Z","body":"What certificate did the browser use?

This is a new issue I haven't had until today with MacRumors. When I open the web, no images are shown. If I close Safari and open it again, the images remain lost. If I disable AdGuard, all the content from the web page returns. There must be something you or the MacRumors developers have changed that prevents the pics to be shown. Please, investigate it. Thank you. Best.

This is a new issue I haven't had until today with MacRumors. When I open the web, no images are shown. If I close Safari and open it again, the images remain lost. If I disable AdGuard, all the content from the web page returns. There must be something you or the MacRumors developers have changed that prevents the pics to be shown. Please, investigate it. Thank you. Best.

Steps to reproduce:\r\n> 1. Open NSFW subreddit\r\n> 2. Click \"Yes, I'm over 18\" button\r\n> 3. Find any post with RedGIFs integration (Reddit doesn't host such images, so it's basically every post)\r\n> 4. Click \"View NSFW content\" button\r\n> \r\n> Actual result:\r\n> \"Error loading this gif\" message\r\n> \r\n> Expected result:\r\n> Content is displayed\r\n> \r\n> Comment:\r\n> The issue seems to be connected to enabled \"network.https.filter.http3.enabled\" setting in Advanced settings. If disabled, the content is loaded. On iOS the content is loaded despite having such filtering enabled by default.
