It lacks a specific rule to conceal the space reserved for advertisements. While on a PC, disabling the script reduces the space to zero, the scenario differs on an iPhone. Due to the persistence of the iframe, it's expected that the advertisement frame remains visible. If there's any other reason for this issue, please let me know for future reference.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/c0o3dekmm94owkk0cwcw8s8sw088800qgbx2npk0ao.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/n96vm6q1shwkww0gowo0g4cc0o0g8oogpticg2iqsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175783/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-27T00:37:51Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
