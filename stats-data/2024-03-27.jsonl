It lacks a specific rule to conceal the space reserved for advertisements. While on a PC, disabling the script reduces the space to zero, the scenario differs on an iPhone. Due to the persistence of the iframe, it's expected that the advertisement frame remains visible.

Comment\r\n> The issue I want to report in my GitHub post is that elements are not disappearing when displayed as \"none\". I am unable to determine the cause of this issue. Here are four possible reasons:\r\n> Adguard for iOS bug: Adguard for iOS is known to cause issues during rule updates. Attempting to resolve this issue involves updating rules, deleting caches, restarting the iPhone, and so on, without success. It has been an ongoing problem for years and has become a nuisance. Apple is the root of all evil.\r\n> Rule compilation? I think this may be the issue, but I'm not sure.\r\n> \r\n> Possibility that the optimized version has not been incorporated: I don't understand why the element is not invisible. Perhaps it is because it is no longer popular or because the rule is excluded.\r\n> \r\n> Possibility that too many rules have caused the issue: iOS 1.7 has rule limitations due to bugs, which may include additional rules that were removed from the optimization.\r\n> \r\n> Possibility that the rules are too old: The rules may be very old, and simply changing the web site may cause them to stop working.\r\n> \r\n> Below is the URL where I uploaded the html for Windows Chrome and iPhone.\r\n> Also, the first and second images are from iPhone, and the third and fourth are from Chrome.\r\n> \r\n> win - https://krakenfiles.com/view/M8KXkbU5wy/file.html\r\n> ios - https://krakenfiles.com/view/eO3TLVoD7w/file.html\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> I would appreciate any help in resolving this issue. Thank you.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/s4c2t3zyhcgcgcssc4kgcokskkg4gsko32ywb8bxo0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/1otsq58hvlb4o4w48wwck0g0wgk8csg4drsilizz6a.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/9eafnxb17qos000wo4s4o0swwwcswg4dhg155xirds.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/m2fv45iqguoc4sk4s4okgogs84wo4kon9xnmkuq2r4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nSystem version: | 17.4.1\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.cloudflare.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/ios/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175779/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2022339190","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175779#issuecomment-2022339190","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175779","id":2022339190,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM854inJ2","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-27T09:49:25Z","updated_at":"2024-03-27T09:49:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Yuki2718 could you also take a look at this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2022339190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-27T09:49:26Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> The issue I want to report in my GitHub post is that elements are not disappearing when displayed as \"none\". I am unable to determine the cause of this issue. Here are four possible reasons:\r\n> Adguard for iOS bug: Adguard for iOS is known to cause issues during rule updates. Attempting to resolve this issue involves updating rules, deleting caches, restarting the iPhone, and so on, without success. It has been an ongoing problem for years and has become a nuisance. Apple is the root of all evil.\r\n> Rule compilation? I think this may be the issue, but I'm not sure.\r\n> \r\n> Possibility that the optimized version has not been incorporated: I don't understand why the element is not invisible. Perhaps it is because it is no longer popular or because the rule is excluded.\r\n> \r\n> Possibility that too many rules have caused the issue: iOS 1.7 has rule limitations due to bugs, which may include additional rules that were removed from the optimization.\r\n> \r\n> Possibility that the rules are too old: The rules may be very old, and simply changing the web site may cause them to stop working.\r\n> \r\n> Below is the URL where I uploaded the html for Windows Chrome and iPhone.\r\n> Also, the first and second images are from iPhone, and the third and fourth are from Chrome.\r\n> \r\n> win - https://krakenfiles.com/view/M8KXkbU5wy/file.html\r\n> ios - https://krakenfiles.com/view/eO3TLVoD7w/file.html\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> I would appreciate any help in resolving this issue.

because Adguard on iPhone struggles to manage iframes effectively.

Comment\r\n> The issue I want to report in my GitHub post is that elements are not disappearing when displayed as \"none\". I am unable to determine the cause of this issue. Here are four possible reasons:\r\n> Adguard for iOS bug: Adguard for iOS is known to cause issues during rule updates. Attempting to resolve this issue involves updating rules, deleting caches, restarting the iPhone, and so on, without success. It has been an ongoing problem for years and has become a nuisance. Apple is the root of all evil.\r\n> Rule compilation? I think this may be the issue, but I'm not sure.\r\n> \r\n> Possibility that the optimized version has not been incorporated: I don't understand why the element is not invisible. Perhaps it is because it is no longer popular or because the rule is excluded.\r\n> \r\n> Possibility that too many rules have caused the issue: iOS 1.7 has rule limitations due to bugs, which may include additional rules that were removed from the optimization.\r\n> \r\n> Possibility that the rules are too old: The rules may be very old, and simply changing the web site may cause them to stop working.\r\n> \r\n> Below is the URL where I uploaded the html for Windows Chrome and iPhone.\r\n> Also, the first and second images are from iPhone, and the third and fourth are from Chrome.\r\n> \r\n> win - https://krakenfiles.com/view/M8KXkbU5wy/file.html\r\n> ios - https://krakenfiles.com/view/eO3TLVoD7w/file.html\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> I would appreciate any help in resolving this issue.
