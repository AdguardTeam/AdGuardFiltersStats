applications, the final \"Save\" button disappears during the backup addition process.\n\nWhen I disable the AdGuard Base filter (while keeping all other filters enabled), the missing button reappears as shown in the screenshot, thus solving the UI problem. I have not been able to find a solution using user filters.\n\nThis may be a complex issue, but I would appreciate it if you could look into it. I have included a link to the source code for the button where the problem occurs in Duplicati for additional reference.\n\nhttps://github.com/duplicati/duplicati/blob/8c6ed9cbba5fd4051ef43d4f921e3ea577f362a4/Duplicati/Server/webroot/ngax/templates/addoredit.html#L409-L412\n\nScreenshots\n\n<details><summary>Screenshot 1 (Problem screen):</summary>\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63ebdfd6-78a9-4d17-bd2d-6c5a9160050d)\n\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Screenshot 2 (Normal screen):</summary>\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75752bda-e929-4b0a-80a9-d67971070b36)\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204805/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2865488285","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204805#issuecomment-2865488285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204805","id":2865488285,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86qy-Gd","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-09T07:38:12Z","updated_at":"2025-05-09T07:38:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@LI-NA Hi.

Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\n在Adguard浏览器扩展中有好几个与中文相关的过滤器，我觉得可以合并成一个过滤器。目前Adguard中文过滤器是基于Easylist china的，可以合并其它过滤器。\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n如图，下面这两个过滤器也是负责中文内容的，可以与Adguard 中文过滤器合并。现在的中文过滤器是基于Easylist china的，可以改成同时基于三个过滤器\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97d933a4-38aa-4fee-a15c-1fa5eaab4307)\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No

Comment\r\n> I was on ebay.co.uk and just did a search for weed fabric. hit the search button it displayed everything apart from the images in the search result, I noticed that when I refreshed the page thinking that might help that it seems to get stuck on the transferring data from ir.ebaystatic.com.\r\n> \r\n> I tried turning off Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin and then Adguard finally which was when it allowed all the images to be displayed. \r\n> \r\n> I then re-enabled them all one at a time and went through a combination to determine that it was something Adguard doesn't like.

Comment\r\n> I was on ebay.co.uk and just did a search for weed fabric. hit the search button it displayed everything apart from the images in the search result, I noticed that when I refreshed the page thinking that might help that it seems to get stuck on the transferring data from ir.ebaystatic.com.\r\n> \r\n> I tried turning off Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin and then Adguard finally which was when it allowed all the images to be displayed. \r\n> \r\n> I then re-enabled them all one at a time and went through a combination to determine that it was something Adguard doesn't like.
