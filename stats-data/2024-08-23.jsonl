visit a website and select YouTube from the quick links, sometimes when I’m browsing videos, channels, or the top page, clicking on links will open them in a new tab instead of the same one. When I check the original tab, an ad site has opened there. The destinations vary, but the original URL is as follows:\r\n> ```\r\n> https://p23hxejm1.com//CPR/CPR.php?c=1843194\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> And there is the list of redirects\r\n> ```\r\n> https://vpn-center.com/cdu/ww/index.php?p1=https://click.vpn-center.com&p2=https://click.vpn-center.com/click&zoneid=1843194&connection_type=other\r\n> \r\n> https://gamdom.com/?utm_source=propellerads&utm_medium=paid\r\n> \r\n> https://ak.ptailadsol.net/4/6280799\r\n> \r\n> https://v.qiepian.vip/a/?code=QOgz0kM0WK\r\n> \r\n> https://p23hxejm1.com/r/dir?zoneid=1843194&pb=8a5ed67ac74da11ec8711dc92c75d4171724251476&psp=aosbZquUoWnIMKmW2g3EjoVTVurHhQbkoR_x36SXMNAJl4LdUHjzlpUobaWL5MWfSuUMi8GUMGDdd-TEOgc5XzsrL7rpgT565lDRcNwSjxdnQW9dRv-W-GoWr18_mMaJYUXWcPMdS0Y1IzV-cs2Kf66k-PBRNz5U6D0mLL9O1N55FnUTlCKgHUsyqwEUvIXQca-xToo2c4pLLvt2dXoWhjPv9AHiEt1djfPKrC_un9c5XUzWnSnzW_1avatabFnUMqrLok9fM3zm60C_E52rzYCfJRRX-zBUXCOxb8CNXpectOwyzVsQcoYgGk7idd0zjitvEoOwBJdk7rJeGgkU1BP6245obf1BluOC6smxo5ltrGxKLQ==&fdl=1&nojs=0&abvar=0&febuild=1.0.314&t=1&wcks=1&wgl=1&cnvs=1&os=-540\r\n> \r\n> https://fulliosdefense.com/landers/valid-vpn/lp11/index.php?lpkey=1701240627f2567738\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> I don't think you can access it anymore since it has expired, but when I look at my browser history, I can see that I was redirected from this URL.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> https://208.87.241.75/channel/UCsBoll12QILGTkmQ4PSttkw?__cpo=aHR0cHM6Ly9tLnlvdXR1YmUuY29t\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186904\r\n> \r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/5cosa9p584kkwc4808k4sggo48g088sd972x6e1xlw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.5\r\nSystem version: | 17.6\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186928/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2306664052","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186928#issuecomment-2306664052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186928","id":2306664052,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86JfOZ0","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-23T09:17:31Z","updated_at":"2024-08-23T09:17:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please record a HAR file of broken page and attach it here as ZIP\r\nHow to get a HAR file:\r\nhttps://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2306664052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-23T09:17:32Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Tempo fa questo problema non c'era ma ora quando clicco su avvia episodio o altri tasti mi apre un'altra scheda con link come quelli di pagine che non esistono, si può capire quando succede perché se si mette il cursore sopra il triangolo al centro dell'episodio per avviarlo il cursore dovrebbe essere a forma di mano quando non c'è una pubblicità ed invece a forma di cursore classico quando è presente una pubblicità. Ribadisco che fino a 1/2 mesi fa era tutto normale, si avviava tutto al primo clic e il cursore era a forma di mano, probabilmente il proprietario aggiorna il sito per contrastare i vari adblocker.\r\nUsername: `@XZAlexModz`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4d4i0mh3lrggcgcc8g0w8csk8c40cooitwqslagb4o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2a60qgjg21340k80oss88gss0cwoww4c6jngicg5og.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.53\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Italy\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186818/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-23T12:24:48Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
