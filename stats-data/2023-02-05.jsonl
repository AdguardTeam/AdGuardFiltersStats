В Google Класс блокируется очень важный элемент, без которого сложно работать. \r\n> \r\n> Если отключить защиту на сайте Google Класс, то нужный элемент появляется. И если запланировать в Google Класс более 2 занятий и поставить таймер на автоматическую публикацию по времени, то на втором занятии список сворачивается и показывается, только последние две даты, а то, что было раньше скрыто под спойлером. Суть в том, что когда защита включена, то AdGuard удаляет кнопку, которая позволяет раскрыть спойлер и взаимодействовать со всем списком запланированных занятий. Таким образом, невозможно планировать более 2-х занятий, так как до остальных не добраться, без кнопки раскрытия спойлера. Если отключить защиту, то кнопка появляется. На скриншотах хорошо все видно...\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/qGCbJDX.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/BWD7DzM.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11.3\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Имеется только ESET Internet Security, но при отключении AdGuard на сайте Google Класс проблемы прекращаются","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142014/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-05T08:54:34Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
