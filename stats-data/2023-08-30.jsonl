Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1698629747","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167#issuecomment-1698629747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167","id":1698629747,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lPwhz","user":{"login":"NUser2018","id":43743908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQzOTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43743908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018","html_url":"https://github.com/NUser2018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-30T07:19:56Z","updated_at":"2023-08-30T07:19:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Sergey-Lyapin и @Alex-302 **ОЧЕНЬ ВАЖНОЕ ОБНОВЛЕНИЕ!** Вообщем приношу свои извинения. Что-то сразу я не догадался ещё и так попробовать проверить. Вообщем похоже обычной очистки кэша в настройках смартфона штатным функционалом операционной системы в настройках для конкретного приложения было недостаточно. Решить мне мою проблему с остатками следов от рекламы помогла переустановка приложения игры (благо игровой прогресс (пройденные уровни, набранные очки и прочее) сохраняется не только локально на устройстве но и в аккаунте Google (в сервисе Google Play Games) и при необходимости переносится и восстанавливается оттуда в настройках игры внутри игры). Теперь и у меня рекламы и даже её следов  нет совсем в приложении данной игры, в том числе нет снова совсем шага\\экрана с рекламой\\следами от рекламы на весь экран при переходе между уровнями. Так что возможно ещё самого первого фикса уже было достаточно, т.к. реклама (само её содержимое) пропала ещё после первого фикса а оставались только следы от попытки загрузки рекламы. Так что возможно последующие дополнительные фиксы были и не очень нужны вообще-то и может быть их даже можно удалить тогда, а может быть и нет, тут вам как специалистам виднее уже, тут уже на ваше усмотрение конечно. Спасибо за быструю реакцию и оперативное решение проблемы. Извините что так получилось что видимо мои локальные недостатки\\глюки на устройстве несколько затянули рассмотрение вопроса и может быть даже несколько ввели вас в заблуждение. В целом проблему можно считать решённой и наверное эту задачу можно тогда и закрыть. Но если вы вдруг всё же будете что-то снова менять по сделанным для неё фиксам в фильтрах то пишите здесь снова в этой задаче и я обязательно всё прочитаю здесь и всё снова посмотрю и проверю если что-то будет нужно. Ещё раз БОЛЬШОЕ СПАСИБО!
