Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1698629747","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167#issuecomment-1698629747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167","id":1698629747,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lPwhz","user":{"login":"NUser2018","id":43743908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQzOTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43743908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018","html_url":"https://github.com/NUser2018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-30T07:19:56Z","updated_at":"2023-08-30T07:19:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Sergey-Lyapin и @Alex-302 **ОЧЕНЬ ВАЖНОЕ ОБНОВЛЕНИЕ!** Вообщем приношу свои извинения.

Решить мне мою проблему с остатками следов от рекламы помогла переустановка приложения игры (благо игровой прогресс (пройденные уровни, набранные очки и прочее) сохраняется не только локально на устройстве но и в аккаунте Google (в сервисе Google Play Games) и при необходимости переносится и восстанавливается оттуда в настройках игры внутри игры). Теперь и у меня рекламы и даже её следов  нет совсем в приложении данной игры, в том числе нет снова совсем шага\\экрана с рекламой\\следами от рекламы на весь экран при переходе между уровнями. Так что возможно ещё самого первого фикса уже было достаточно, т.к. реклама (само её содержимое) пропала ещё после первого фикса а оставались только следы от попытки загрузки рекламы. Так что возможно последующие дополнительные фиксы были и не очень нужны вообще-то и может быть их даже можно удалить тогда, а может быть и нет, тут вам как специалистам виднее уже, тут уже на ваше усмотрение конечно. Спасибо за быструю реакцию и оперативное решение проблемы. Извините что так получилось что видимо мои локальные недостатки\\глюки на устройстве несколько затянули рассмотрение вопроса и может быть даже несколько ввели вас в заблуждение. В целом проблему можно считать решённой и наверное эту задачу можно тогда и закрыть. Но если вы вдруг всё же будете что-то снова менять по сделанным для неё фиксам в фильтрах то пишите здесь снова в этой задаче и я обязательно всё прочитаю здесь и всё снова посмотрю и проверю если что-то будет нужно. Ещё раз БОЛЬШОЕ СПАСИБО!

Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-30T10:38:01Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

These are currently not being blocked by AdGuard.\r\n\r\nThey are similar to the Promoted results on Twitter, Facebook and other sites.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n### Individual sponsored results\r\n![individual_sponsored_results](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/10184251/e9657ac1-a062-4c13-9725-54820d0a2f56)\r\n\r\n### Carousel of sponsored results\r\n![carousel_of_sponsored_results](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/10184251/45cf9f07-e0be-49b0-b4f6-c94f51f458dc)\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI would like to contribute the filters I have created for https://instacart.*. These have been tested in AdGuard on Firefox desktop (Windows), as well as on Safari iOS. \r\n\r\nThese rules hide the individual Sponsored results, as well as the various types of Sponsored carousels on each store's homepage and in search results.\r\n\r\nAlthough these filters work fine, the one optimization that I would love to do but was unable to based on my understanding of the filter syntax and capabilities, is the following. In two of the rules below, I am identifying a div that satisfies two conditions: (1) it must contain a `div[aria-label=\"item carousel\"]` and (2) it must contain a `span:contains(Sponsor)`. (These elements are not direct children of the parent.) The optimal solution here is to identify the _closest_ ancestor that satisfies these conditions; in other words, the closest parent div that contain both elements listed above. The only way I was able to make this work was to explicitly describe the path using `div:has(> div > div > div > span:contains(Sponsor), div[aria-label=\"item carousel\"])`, but this is brittle because the website could easily change the page structure and defeat this rule. I welcome and appreciate any guidance for improvements. Aside from that, these rules do work based on my tests. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n```\r\ninstacart.*##div[aria-label=\"Product\"]:has(span:contains(Sponsor)):upward(li)\r\ninstacart.*##div:has(> div > div > div > span:contains(Sponsor), div[aria-label=\"item carousel\"])\r\ninstacart.*##div:matches-attr(\"data-testid\"=\"async-item-list\")\r\ninstacart.*##div[aria-label=\"item carousel\"]:has(span:contains(Sponsor))\r\n\r\n!

Потом догадалась нажать meatballs-меню справа в самом рекламном баннере, тогда уже там образовывалось пустое место, по которому я кликала, чтобы заблокировать элемент. Все выглядело хорошо, пока я не обновляла страницу. Все равно на этом же месте возникает та же самая реклама. Теперь на этом месте реклама Альфа-Банка+Яндекс Маркет.

Comment\r\nUsername: @115dkk\r\n> 1. I have the same problem with all galleries (bulletin boards) on a site called dcinside. The gallery I specified in the link is just one example.\r\n> \r\n> 2. intermittently, when I try to access, refresh, enter a post/comment, etc., it just loads pointlessly and never completes, as if the browser is lagging.\r\n> \r\n> 3. In that state, I can't select any links, try to refresh again, or even hit back button to go back until I get to the new tab home.\r\n> \r\n> 4. like 'namu wiki', I have a suspicion that the company is intentionally making the site difficult to use if you have adblock enabled.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/npk3eowo1hws8880kw84k4oosw40wo0btj3rewqkjc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/iw5zdzox51k4kgkwco0wwo0g4040k8o5umb8xhphjc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.14\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (30), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://***.d.adguard-dns.com,tls://254ff525.d.adguard-dns.com,https://254ff525.d.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/windows/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>List-KR, <br/>AdGuard Japanese\r\nUserscripts: | https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/List-KR/NamuLink@main/NamuLink.user.js,<br>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/List-KR/microShield@main/microShield.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/lists?id=ftl](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgall.dcinside.com%2Fmgallery%2Fboard%2Flists%3Fid%3Dftl)\r\nOther extensions used: |  Listly/DownThemAll!/Eightify/Gimme Summary/GoFullPage/Image Downloader/ShareGPT/클린디씨/프롬프트 지니/Ahnlab V3","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158328/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1699977917","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158328#issuecomment-1699977917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158328","id":1699977917,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lU5q9","user":{"login":"Kieaer","id":44261958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjYxOTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44261958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kieaer","html_url":"https://github.com/Kieaer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kieaer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kieaer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kieaer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kieaer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kieaer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kieaer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kieaer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kieaer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kieaer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-30T23:21:11Z","updated_at":"2023-08-30T23:21:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This bug also occurred when the issue I submitted occurred.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1699977917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-30T23:21:12Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
