Comment\r\n> Hi guys! I've always found adguard to be the best! Usually works every time. Thanks! But this site in Australia I stream from has ads and your extension and that site don't mix. If I try to watch with adguard on, the player stops after a short time. I have to refresh, turn adguard off, then it will continue, but with ads. I find Adguard frees me from ads on a lot of sites. But this https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand just won't function with adguard turned on. It has worked in the past, but not now. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/94H7uxn.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Ih1lLBi.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.55\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters</details>\r\nOther extensions used: | AVG Security; AVG Antivirus","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/152016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/152016/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-29T06:16:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
