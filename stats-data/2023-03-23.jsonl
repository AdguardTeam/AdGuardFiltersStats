Здравствуйте. \r\n>  Проблема такая, что последнее время часто теряется доступ к Госуслугам, если запрос к ним идет через иностранный dns-сервер, для \"иностранцев\" они дают точку входа по ip

Comment\r\nUsername: @misc-activities\r\n> In the Walmart login page (see 0.png), I entered my email address and clicked on the Continue button. It opened a message box trying to show me a \"Press and Hold\" type CAPTCHA but the CAPTCHA didn't load. This can be seen in 1.png. So, I clicked on \"Try a different method\" in the message box. When I did that, it showed me a picture identification type CAPTCHA (see 2.png). When I completed the CAPTCHA verification, instead of asking me for the password, it went back to the page where it was asking for my email address and showed a message saying, \"Something went wrong, please try again.\" This can be seen in 3.png.\r\n> \r\n> I closed the AdGuard app and tried and I was able to login successfully. I also tried with Stealth Mode disabled but that didn't work.\r\n> \r\n> I'm having this issue in Safari as well.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/EevidNP.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/HE5788c.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/qwCTkAZ.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://reports-img.adguard.com/fyb5z94.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.9.2.1234+release\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (), <br>Hide your User-Agent (), <br>Hide your IP address ()\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant and AdGuard Extra","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1480835011","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063#issuecomment-1480835011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063","id":1480835011,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85YQ7_D","user":{"login":"jellizaveta","id":91964807,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXtFhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91964807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta","html_url":"https://github.com/jellizaveta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-23T09:10:45Z","updated_at":"2023-03-23T09:10:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@misc-activities I received your login and password in the mail, thank you!

Comment\r\nUsername: @misc-activities\r\n> In the Walmart login page (see 0.png), I entered my email address and clicked on the Continue button. It opened a message box trying to show me a \"Press and Hold\" type CAPTCHA but the CAPTCHA didn't load. This can be seen in 1.png. So, I clicked on \"Try a different method\" in the message box. When I did that, it showed me a picture identification type CAPTCHA (see 2.png). When I completed the CAPTCHA verification, instead of asking me for the password, it went back to the page where it was asking for my email address and showed a message saying, \"Something went wrong, please try again.\" This can be seen in 3.png.\r\n> \r\n> I closed the AdGuard app and tried and I was able to login successfully. I also tried with Stealth Mode disabled but that didn't work.\r\n> \r\n> I'm having this issue in Safari as well.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/EevidNP.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/HE5788c.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/qwCTkAZ.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://reports-img.adguard.com/fyb5z94.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.9.2.1234+release\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (), <br>Hide your User-Agent (), <br>Hide your IP address ()\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant and AdGuard Extra","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1480976956","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063#issuecomment-1480976956","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063","id":1480976956,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85YReo8","user":{"login":"jellizaveta","id":91964807,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXtFhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91964807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta","html_url":"https://github.com/jellizaveta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-23T10:54:27Z","updated_at":"2023-03-23T10:54:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@misc-activities Fixed, filter updates will be available in 1-2 hours.

Comment\r\nUsername: @misc-activities\r\n> In the Walmart login page (see 0.png), I entered my email address and clicked on the Continue button. It opened a message box trying to show me a \"Press and Hold\" type CAPTCHA but the CAPTCHA didn't load. This can be seen in 1.png. So, I clicked on \"Try a different method\" in the message box.

Comment\r\nUsername: @quaybj\r\n> This food ordering site has the option to get weekly discounts.  The link to the promotion number and the discounted list does not work with adguard installed on my machines (MAC and PC). I have Chrome, Firefox, and Brave.  That particular URL is blocked for all of them.  I am using https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query in my router DNS setting.  Disabling adguard in the browsers does not work, maybe because it's the router DNS?  The picture where the box is seen is from a machine where adguard is not installed at all.  \r\n> \r\n> While making this query, I saw a lot of references to information on the settings for adguard, can you point me to the manual?  I don't even know if I am using some of the settings or not, so I could not really answer the questions.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/X9bzzF4.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/yimObJ0.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/54ilnKm.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11.3\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://unfiltered.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.freshdirect.com/login/login.jsp?successPage=/your_account/chef_table.jsp](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freshdirect.com%2Flogin%2Flogin.jsp%3FsuccessPage%3D%2Fyour_account%2Fchef_table.jsp)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145214/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1481101953","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145214#issuecomment-1481101953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145214","id":1481101953,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85YR9KB","user":{"login":"Sergey-Lyapin","id":18536328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM2MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18536328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin","html_url":"https://github.com/Sergey-Lyapin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-23T12:23:30Z","updated_at":"2023-03-23T12:23:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@quaybj\r\nCould you please send me the saved page?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1481101953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-23T12:23:30Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

You don't have a damn option for the issue that I'm having, which is that AdGuard blocked the domain \"1337x.to\". It's been like this for at least a day or two. Hitting \"More information\" just takes me to a site that tells me that 1337x.to is completely safe, and doesn't explain why the damn site has been blocked, and I can't for the love of me find a way to disable the damn block!

You don't have a damn option for the issue that I'm having, which is that AdGuard blocked the domain \"1337x.to\". It's been like this for at least a day or two. Hitting \"More information\" just takes me to a site that tells me that 1337x.to is completely safe, and doesn't explain why the damn site has been blocked, and I can't for the love of me find a way to disable the damn block!

Comment\r\nUsername: @misc-activities\r\n> In the Walmart login page (see 0.png), I entered my email address and clicked on the Continue button. It opened a message box trying to show me a \"Press and Hold\" type CAPTCHA but the CAPTCHA didn't load. This can be seen in 1.png. So, I clicked on \"Try a different method\" in the message box. When I did that, it showed me a picture identification type CAPTCHA (see 2.png). When I completed the CAPTCHA verification, instead of asking me for the password, it went back to the page where it was asking for my email address and showed a message saying, \"Something went wrong, please try again.\" This can be seen in 3.png.\r\n> \r\n> I closed the AdGuard app and tried and I was able to login successfully. I also tried with Stealth Mode disabled but that didn't work.\r\n> \r\n> I'm having this issue in Safari as well.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/EevidNP.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/HE5788c.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/qwCTkAZ.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://reports-img.adguard.com/fyb5z94.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.9.2.1234+release\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (), <br>Hide your User-Agent (), <br>Hide your IP address ()\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant and AdGuard Extra","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1481810847","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063#issuecomment-1481810847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063","id":1481810847,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85YUqOf","user":{"login":"misc-activities","id":51946231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTQ2MjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51946231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities","html_url":"https://github.com/misc-activities","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-23T19:57:11Z","updated_at":"2023-03-23T19:57:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jellizaveta Thanks!
