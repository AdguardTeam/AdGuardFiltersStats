Comment\r\nUsername: @DandelionSprout\r\n> While not logged in, an uncloseable login prompt when scrolling down on not only frontpages, but also very long individual posts nowadays.\r\n> \r\n> Since the mass exodus from Twitter to Tumblr seems to me personally like it'd warrant fast treatment, I'll let you guys borrow `www.tumblr.com#?##glass-container:has(p + p):has(a[href^=\"/auth/google?\"])` from Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List into AdGuard Popups Filters with no reservations or conditions of any kind. Alternately you guys can also use whichever entries you guys would write.\r\n> \r\n> The entry has worked for at least 2 months now, even if there still may be other Tumblr-side annoyances remaining (Most notably that the ••• buttons don't work after scrolling down slightly, which I never found a good fix for).\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/3ile3nh8woe884w0k8gog4kw0k4gsg86bgh67exwww.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | uBO 1.50.0 + I Don't Care About Cookies 3.4.7\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Serbo-Croatian List\r\nCustom filters: | uBlock Filters - Ads,<br>uBlock Filters - Badware Risks,<br>uBlock Filters - Annoyances,<br>Fanboy's Notifications Blocking List","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155809/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1641263194","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155809#issuecomment-1641263194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155809","id":1641263194,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85h07Ba","user":{"login":"stephenhawk8054","id":66517106,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NTE3MTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66517106?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenhawk8054","html_url":"https://github.com/stephenhawk8054","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenhawk8054/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenhawk8054/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenhawk8054/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenhawk8054/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenhawk8054/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenhawk8054/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenhawk8054/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenhawk8054/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenhawk8054/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-19T01:45:50Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T01:45:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ah nope, the one causing login issue is the URL one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1641263194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-19T01:45:51Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
