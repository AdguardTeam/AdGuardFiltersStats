Comment\r\n> The big toto banner ( that I reported several times) that is visible every time there is a Formula 1 race, is automatic removed when I use the normal English base filter instead of the English optimized filter. Don't know if that list is to big, maybe it's possible to add these lines also to the android English optimized filter. \r\n> \r\n> This add is visible in optimized as the normal English filter. \r\nUsername: `@Glassertje`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jxwe9r2cudc480o8wwckoss88swo0c45a2g8ph31b4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.5\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Firefox Mobiel\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.cloudflare.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Dutch\r\nCustom filters: | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/adblock/light.txt\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/181339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/181339/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-21T06:13:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
