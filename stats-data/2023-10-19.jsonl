If I disable AdGuard, close the browsers, then restart, the unsubscribe button is visible again. I did update filters.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/cq7zhgkoi08o4skkkgwcg8ggock0socbliaty4vxnk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.2.168\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List\r\nOther extensions used: | cookie auto delete","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162262/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1769837070","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162262#issuecomment-1769837070","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162262","id":1769837070,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85pfZIO","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-19T03:33:53Z","updated_at":"2023-10-19T03:33:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Anti Adblock Script)\r\n [https://www.youtube.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/thduwqmyd1c04go4oks0co4g00k8ws010z5v7uksuc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.15\r\nSystem version: | MacOS 14.0\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1769837070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-10-19T03:33:54Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Hi, Tried to reproduce the issue. Under exact same setting, except Windows 10 has been updated to 19045.3570 (I don't think this would make a difference though).

Some would still load when Adguard is on(with various enocdings). I thought it was the encoding problem last time, but this time it proves me wrong. I don't think its related to video encoding but some other problem now. I will look into this when I have more time, and keep you updated.\r\n\r\nCheers :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1769835334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-10-19T03:31:10Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
