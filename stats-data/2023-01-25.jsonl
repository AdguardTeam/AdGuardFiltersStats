This means that the previous owner of the domains did not renew them. So these domains can be removed from list to make this list lighter (Adguard DNS and any other adguard list).\r\nLists of dead domains that I found can be downloaded in below:\r\n[adguard dead domains.txt](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/files/10494698/adguard.dead.domains.txt)\r\nyou can check them yourself on https://www.godaddy.com/domains/bulk-domain-search\r\nIf you want, I can check all of the list.\r\n\r\n2.
