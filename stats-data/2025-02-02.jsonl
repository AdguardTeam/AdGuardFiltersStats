Comment\r\n> This isn't a filter malfunction report.\r\n> The explanation for the filter in the red box seems unnatural.\r\n> In AdGuard for Android 4.7.1, the explanation for the \"AdGuard Base filter\" is not the correct description of the filter's original function, but rather appears to be a misprinted, different description.\r\n> I recall that in versions prior to 4.7.1, the explanation was something like \"Filters recommended by AdGuard.\"\r\n> It seems that such misprints are found in filters other than the \"AdGuard Base filter\" as well.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n
