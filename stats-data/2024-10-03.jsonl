Comment\r\n> If I turn off AdGuard, the translator works fine. If you turn on AdGuard, not only this button but also the translation function will not work. Not only the translator but also the stock graph 1 year 5 year maximum period buttons that can be used in Google's main search do not work. When you hit a certain store, the results are displayed on the map. When you click on the store, it should get bigger and show more detailed information, but that doesn't work either.\r\n> \r\n>  For some reason, many of the features available in the main Google search do not work. This seems to be the core problem.\r\nUsername: `@.`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
