These are currently not being blocked by AdGuard.\r\n\r\nThey are similar to the Promoted results on Twitter, Facebook and other sites.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n### Individual sponsored results\r\n![individual_sponsored_results](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/10184251/e9657ac1-a062-4c13-9725-54820d0a2f56)\r\n\r\n### Carousel of sponsored results\r\n![carousel_of_sponsored_results](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/10184251/45cf9f07-e0be-49b0-b4f6-c94f51f458dc)\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nI would like to contribute the filters I have created for https://instacart.*. These have been tested in AdGuard on Firefox desktop (Windows), as well as on Safari iOS. \r\n\r\nThese rules hide the individual Sponsored results, as well as the various types of Sponsored carousels on each store's homepage and in search results.\r\n\r\nAlthough these filters work fine, the one optimization that I would love to do but was unable to based on my understanding of the filter syntax and capabilities, is the following. In two of the rules below, I am identifying a div that satisfies two conditions: (1) it must contain a `div[aria-label=\"item carousel\"]` and (2) it must contain a `span:contains(Sponsor)`. (These elements are not direct children of the parent.) The optimal solution here is to identify the _closest_ ancestor that satisfies these conditions; in other words, the closest parent div that contain both elements listed above. The only way I was able to make this work was to explicitly describe the path using `div:has(> div > div > div > span:contains(Sponsor), div[aria-label=\"item carousel\"])`, but this is brittle because the website could easily change the page structure and defeat this rule. I welcome and appreciate any guidance for improvements. Aside from that, these rules do work based on my tests. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n```\r\ninstacart.*##div[aria-label=\"Product\"]:has(span:contains(Sponsor)):upward(li)\r\ninstacart.*##div:has(> div > div > div > span:contains(Sponsor), div[aria-label=\"item carousel\"])\r\ninstacart.*##div:matches-attr(\"data-testid\"=\"async-item-list\")\r\ninstacart.*##div[aria-label=\"item carousel\"]:has(span:contains(Sponsor))\r\n\r\n!
