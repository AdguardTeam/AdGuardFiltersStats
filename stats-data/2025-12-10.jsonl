When the URL redirect is via redirectingat.com the redirect doesn't work when using Adguard DNS settings on my router. I am forced to connect to my neighbor's wifi in order to get the links to work.\r\n> \r\n> The starting URL in the example shown in the screenshots is: https://slickdeals.net/f/18935398-darn-tough-socks-buy-1-get-1-1-free-s-h-on-75?v=1\r\n> \r\n> I previously reported this on Sept. 30, 2025 (ticket 1189820), and part of Adguard support's response was this comment, along with a screenshot:\r\n> \r\n> \"This website is blocked not only with Safebrowsing, but also with other AdGuard filters (screenshot included):\r\n> \r\n> Please use this form to report it: https://reports.adguard.com/en/new_issue.html. Our filter developers will review it and provide a suitable solution, if any.\"\r\n> \r\n> Slickdeals.net is the largest deal-hunting site in the US, and having its links constantly non-functional when using your DNS settings is extremely inconvenient.

Our filter developers will review it and provide a suitable solution, if any.\"\r\n> \r\n> Slickdeals.net is the largest deal-hunting site in the US, and having its links constantly non-functional when using your DNS settings is extremely inconvenient.

<comment>\n\nAWAvenue filter was added as Chinese upstream list through https://github.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersRegistry/issues/1153 about a week ago. And since then two main request for v.qq.com was blocked incorrectly, and following fallback request was blocked by EasyListPrivacy anti tracking rule, together result in playback failure.\n\nwhat happens are:\n\n1. AWAvenue blocks vd6.l.qq.com and vi.l.qq.com, both requests are for the content\n2. As a fallback, some JSONP requests are made for the content, and was blocked by Privacy tracking due to refer keyword was presented in the src\n3. result in playback failure\n\nMy reproduction requires two different Adblock extension(AdGuard + AdBlock Plus), turning on EasyListPrivacy in AdGuard does not directly causes critical failure but still it incorrectly blocks the first two requests.\n\nupdate:\nAfter checking EasyList Privacy file, my guess is their general rule does not exactly follows your filter structure?\nthe rule that actually blocks JSONP request in Adblock Plus is \n```\nrefer=http$script\n```\nwhich in AdGuard's term should be, if I understand correctly\n```\n||refer=http^$script\n```\n\n2.

<comment>\n\nAWAvenue filter was added as Chinese upstream list through https://github.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersRegistry/issues/1153 about a week ago. And since then two main request for v.qq.com was blocked incorrectly, and following fallback request was blocked by EasyListPrivacy anti tracking rule, together result in playback failure.\n\nwhat happens are:\n\n1. AWAvenue blocks vd6.l.qq.com and vi.l.qq.com, both requests are for the content\n2. As a fallback, some JSONP requests are made for the content, and was blocked by Privacy tracking due to refer keyword was presented in the src\n3. result in playback failure\n\nMy reproduction requires two different Adblock extension(AdGuard + AdBlock Plus), turning on EasyListPrivacy in AdGuard does not directly causes critical failure but still it incorrectly blocks the first two requests.\n\nupdate:\nAfter checking EasyList Privacy file, my guess is their general rule does not exactly follows your filter structure?\nthe rule that actually blocks JSONP request in Adblock Plus is \n```\nrefer=http$script\n```\nwhich in AdGuard's term should be, if I understand correctly\n```\n||refer=http^$script\n```\n\n2.
