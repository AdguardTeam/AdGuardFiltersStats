Please answer the following questions for yourself before submitting an issue.\n\n- [x] I am running the latest version\n- [x] I made sure all content blockers are enabled in Safari settings\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed\n\n### AdGuard version\n\n1.11.22\n\n### Environment\n\n```markdown\n- OS: 15.5 (24F74)\n- Safari version: Version 18.5 (20621.2.5.11.8)\n```\n\n### What filters do you have enabled?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Issue Details\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Go to any site that has a cookie pop-up\n2. Cookie pop up is displayed even though all of the filters and blocklists for cookie pop-ups are enabled\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect to not see the cookie pop ups. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCookie pop-ups are displayed. \n\n### Screenshots\n\n<img width=\"2016\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36c6b33b-7b35-48f6-9130-0a6828d3cfc5\" />\n\n<img width=\"1072\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d716f87-5392-46e7-a038-49503ba14a0b\" />\n\n<img width=\"2016\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8957434b-3a9a-474a-933f-567f51796386\" />\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThe AdGuard test page reports that annoyance blocking is not enabled/detected - however these settings are turned on. This behaviour has started since I 'erased and reset all settings' on my MacBook and re-installed the AdGuard for Safari extension.

At least there is a workaround for now by turning off the AdGuard Popups filter. \n\nJust as a note, it only seems to affect 'new' installs. My other two Macs running the same versions of everything are not affected by this issue. This only occurred on a 'new' MacBook with fresh install. I tried a clean install of OS X too for avoidance of doubt and the issue still persisted on the 'new' machine.

On screenshot not reports.adguard.com\n\nChrome now supports multi-language live caption and translation features. We can turn this funtion ON in chrome's Accessibility settings. When this feature is enabled, as soon as a video or audio clip is detected playing on a website, a floating semi-transparent window will pop up on the page. It provides live captions and real-time translation (if the user has also enabled translation).\n\nProblem: If Adguard is enabled on a web page, the live caption will not appear (it seems that adguard misrecognizes it as an advertisement). If Adguard is toggled off on a web page, after refreshing the page and playing the video, the live caption will pop up properly.\n\nThe problem is reproducible on ALL webpage with a video or audio playing. You can turn on any webpage that plays video（for example any video on Youtube）.\n\n**Steps to reproduce：**\n1. enable the Live Caption feature in Chrome settings. At the same time, make sure AdGuard is enabled\n2. open _any webpage with a video_ that can be played. You will find that the Live Caption feature does not appear on the web page.\n3. click on the AdGuard logo in the Chrome extension bar and select to switch it off. Then refresh the video page, play the video again, and the semi-transparent Live Caption window will appear normally.\n\nThe screenshot I took is from AdGuard's official YouTube page as an example. However, since this issue occurs on any page where videos can be played, I filled in the AdGuard official website link as a substitute.\n\n@Alex-302 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2930067005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-02T11:02:14Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Cookie pop up is displayed even though all of the filters and blocklists for cookie pop-ups are enabled\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect to not see the cookie pop ups. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCookie pop-ups are displayed. \n\n### Screenshots\n\n<img width=\"2016\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36c6b33b-7b35-48f6-9130-0a6828d3cfc5\" />\n\n<img width=\"1072\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d716f87-5392-46e7-a038-49503ba14a0b\" />\n\n<img width=\"2016\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8957434b-3a9a-474a-933f-567f51796386\" />\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThe AdGuard test page reports that annoyance blocking is not enabled/detected - however these settings are turned on. This behaviour has started since I 'erased and reset all settings' on my MacBook and re-installed the AdGuard for Safari extension.

This is not a block list, it is an option in General Settings, and it uses (as far as I understand it) AdGuard's own parental control service, run and managed by AdGuard. I believe this is the same service providing parental controls for AdGuard's other products, including the applications and the DNS service.\r\n> \r\n> With the parental control service enabled, the domain kobo.com is blocked (the logs clearly show this is blocked by the Parental Control service and not by any block list). \r\n> \r\n> This domain is for the famous e-reader brand, Kobo.

Please answer the following questions for yourself before submitting an issue.\n\n- [x] I am running the latest version\n- [x] I made sure all content blockers are enabled in Safari settings\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed\n\n### AdGuard version\n\n1.11.22\n\n### Environment\n\n```markdown\n- OS: 15.5 (24F74)\n- Safari version: Version 18.5 (20621.2.5.11.8)\n```\n\n### What filters do you have enabled?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Issue Details\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Go to any site that has a cookie pop-up\n2. Cookie pop up is displayed even though all of the filters and blocklists for cookie pop-ups are enabled\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect to not see the cookie pop ups. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCookie pop-ups are displayed. \n\n### Screenshots\n\n<img width=\"2016\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36c6b33b-7b35-48f6-9130-0a6828d3cfc5\" />\n\n<img width=\"1072\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d716f87-5392-46e7-a038-49503ba14a0b\" />\n\n<img width=\"2016\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8957434b-3a9a-474a-933f-567f51796386\" />\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThe AdGuard test page reports that annoyance blocking is not enabled/detected - however these settings are turned on. This behaviour has started since I 'erased and reset all settings' on my MacBook and re-installed the AdGuard for Safari extension.

They are also a major e-book store. \r\n> Therefore I don't think it should be blocked by Parental Controls (not any more than Amazon should).\r\nUsername: `@dinosmm`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/rmxg2blhpz4w4wccggg4sk4owk4wkgs9kh2t9erhbk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/9ajdknrpm6sckss8w400k40gcgo0w48p62jv9tcho0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | AdGuard Home\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Family Protection server\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10, Linux Mint, Android 15\r\nBrowser: | Firefox Mobile\r\nBlocklists: | <b>General:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nCustom filters: | AdGuard Parental Control service","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206820/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-02T12:28:23Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

В управлении приложениями, объединение системных приложений в 2 и более приложения. Раньше КАЖДЫМ системным приложением можно было управлять по отдельности.\n\n2. Использование оперативной памяти увеличилось процентов на 45.\n\n3. Раньше поиск в управлении приложениями проводился и по имени пакета и по имени приложения. В 4 версии только по имени приложения.\n\n4. Раньше в управлении приложениями, для каждого приложения сразу отображались потреблённые и сэкономленные данные и можно было сортировать приложения по использованию данных, по заблокированным данным, либо по количеству всех запросов.\n\n5. В журнале фильтрации из \"Деталей журнала\" можно было нажатием на имя приложения перейти к управлению им, а теперь нажатие открывает системное окно \"О приложении\".\n\n6. В технической информации о приложении (любом) теперь не отображается код версии.\n\n7. В управлении приложениями, в окне подробностей, нажатие на строку с именем приложения открывало системное окно \"О приложении\", а теперь ничего не происходит.\n\n8. В управлении приложениями, в окне подробностей о приложении отображалась статистика фильтрации, а теперь нужно каждый раз нажимать 2 раза для просмотра статистики фильтрации. Да ещё и при нажатии кнопки \"Назад\", происходит переход в общую статистику, а не в подробности о приложении.\n\nА в общем, интерфейс стал намного НЕприятнее для глаз, всё какое-то крупное, неудобное и раздражает. При использовании 3 версии даже удовольствие получаю от того, какой гладкий и понятный интерфейс, а при использовании 4 в основном отвращение к интерфейсу. Особенно раздражает интерфейс общей статистики.\n\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2930817124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-02T13:45:31Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nHello,\n\nThere are already effective [filtering rules ](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/commit/be7975c3353b62161fc4a3a9d12bfdd3feba2008)for the `deals.digidip.net` domain.\n\nBut I've noticed that there's now sometimes a variant: `dealabs2de.digidip.net`\n\nExamples:\nhttps://dealabs2de.digidip.net/visit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.fr%2Fdp%2FB07BCNJV9N%3Fsmid%3DA1X6FK5RDHNB96&ppref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dealabs.com%2F&ref=ppr-fr-1733286833\n\nhttps://dealabs2de.digidip.net/visit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.fr%2Fdp%2FB0CYH5VPJC%3Fsmid%3DA1X6FK5RDHNB96&ppref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dealabs.com%2F&ref=ppr-fr-1733287761\n\nhttps://dealabs2de.digidip.net/visit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.fr%2Fdp%2FB0CFL49C1J%3Fsmid%3DA1X6FK5RDHNB96&ppref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dealabs.com%2F&ref=ppr-fr-1744318189\n\nCould you modify the current rules to include it? \n\n### Proposed solution\n\n```\n||*dealabs*.digidip.net/visit?url=$urltransform=/%3A/:/\n||*dealabs*.digidip.net/visit?url=$urltransform=/%2F/\\//\n||*dealabs*.digidip.net/visit?url=$urltransform=/%3F/?/\n||*dealabs*.digidip.net/visit?url=$urltransform=/%3D/=/\n||*dealabs*.digidip.net/visit?url=$urltransform=/^https?:\\/\\/(?:[a-z0-9-]+\\.)*?(?:dealabs|dealabs2de)\\.digidip\\.net.*url=([^&]*).*/\\$1/\n```\n\nI'm not sure it is the best syntax, not being an expert in this field, but It works on all the urls I've tested. \n\nThank you\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No

Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nHello,\n\nThere are already effective [filtering rules ](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/commit/be7975c3353b62161fc4a3a9d12bfdd3feba2008)for the `deals.digidip.net` domain.\n\nBut I've noticed that there's now sometimes a variant: `dealabs2de.digidip.net`\n\nExamples:\nhttps://dealabs2de.digidip.net/visit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.fr%2Fdp%2FB07BCNJV9N%3Fsmid%3DA1X6FK5RDHNB96&ppref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dealabs.com%2F&ref=ppr-fr-1733286833\n\nhttps://dealabs2de.digidip.net/visit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.fr%2Fdp%2FB0CYH5VPJC%3Fsmid%3DA1X6FK5RDHNB96&ppref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dealabs.com%2F&ref=ppr-fr-1733287761\n\nhttps://dealabs2de.digidip.net/visit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.fr%2Fdp%2FB0CFL49C1J%3Fsmid%3DA1X6FK5RDHNB96&ppref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dealabs.com%2F&ref=ppr-fr-1744318189\n\nCould you modify the current rules to include it? \n\n### Proposed solution\n\n```\n||*dealabs*.digidip.net/visit?url=$urltransform=/%3A/:/\n||*dealabs*.digidip.net/visit?url=$urltransform=/%2F/\\//\n||*dealabs*.digidip.net/visit?url=$urltransform=/%3F/?/\n||*dealabs*.digidip.net/visit?url=$urltransform=/%3D/=/\n||*dealabs*.digidip.net/visit?url=$urltransform=/^https?:\\/\\/(?:[a-z0-9-]+\\.)*?(?:dealabs|dealabs2de)\\.digidip\\.net.*url=([^&]*).*/\\$1/\n```\n\nI'm not sure it is the best syntax, not being an expert in this field, but It works on all the urls I've tested. \n\nThank you\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No

Please answer the following questions for yourself before submitting an issue.\n\n- [x] I am running the latest version\n- [x] I made sure all content blockers are enabled in Safari settings\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed\n\n### AdGuard version\n\n1.11.22\n\n### Environment\n\n```markdown\n- OS: 15.5 (24F74)\n- Safari version: Version 18.5 (20621.2.5.11.8)\n```\n\n### What filters do you have enabled?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Issue Details\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Go to any site that has a cookie pop-up\n2. Cookie pop up is displayed even though all of the filters and blocklists for cookie pop-ups are enabled\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect to not see the cookie pop ups. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCookie pop-ups are displayed. \n\n### Screenshots\n\n<img width=\"2016\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36c6b33b-7b35-48f6-9130-0a6828d3cfc5\" />\n\n<img width=\"1072\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d716f87-5392-46e7-a038-49503ba14a0b\" />\n\n<img width=\"2016\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8957434b-3a9a-474a-933f-567f51796386\" />\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThe AdGuard test page reports that annoyance blocking is not enabled/detected - however these settings are turned on. This behaviour has started since I 'erased and reset all settings' on my MacBook and re-installed the AdGuard for Safari extension.

Please note this is a very recent regression that started on May 27, 2025 and prior to that all video ads were blocked. \n\nThe behaviour is different on iPhone where mobile version of YouTube in Safari is used. In that case all ads are blocked as before.\n\nIn desktop Safari, with latest AdGuard and all most up to date filters, the behaviour is different for logged in case vs viewing without logging in.\n\nIf I don't log in to my account, no video ads are displayed. When clicking on any video, it plays immediately with no spinner and no ads. \n\nIf I do log in, the behaviour changes:\n\nOnce you click on any video, the page loads and video does not play immediately. Initially, spinner is displayed for quite long time and after that an ad is displayed. You have an option to skip the ad and then the video plays normally. \n\nPlease note that Brave Browser with its default ad blocker does not display any ads and videos start immediately.
