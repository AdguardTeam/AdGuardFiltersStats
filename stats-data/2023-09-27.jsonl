It gave me an error, so I uploaded black screens. When I open a link with my filtering protection on specifically, DNS protection, the Spotify link will only open to the main Spotify page. When I disable specifically DNS protections, the Spotify link will correctly open directly to the song. I have also seen this happen with Reddit links. I believe the issue deals with how iPhones handle passing links between applications, and how the DNS filtering intercepts these and maybe clips off some important targeting information for the link. Either way, it means that all of the Spotify links my friend sent me an iMessage and Instagram I cannot open properly.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hw2pakz3v7s4g0og4kcoks4ggg4kcwo7qjhia8jjdo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hw2pakz3v7s4g0og4kcoks4ggg4kcwo7qjhia8jjdo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.5.0\r\nBrowser: | All apps including email, instagram, and iMessage \r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162674/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-27T17:24:03Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
