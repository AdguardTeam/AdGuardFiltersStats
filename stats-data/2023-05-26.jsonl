I would like to introduce myself as one of the certified authors of the reported website. The project I have been working on in the community involves creating iOS system shortcuts, which are completely free for users to utilize. The individual who reported us is simply someone who intentionally spreads false information about others, and there have been numerous similar cases in the past. Within our community, this reporter has already gained a notorious reputation. Please feel free to conduct a thorough investigation. It is important to note that the reported website is fully compliant with Chinese laws and regulations, and it has undergone the necessary registration procedures. Through my investigation, I have discovered that the person behind the report is a primary school student, just over ten years old. I kindly request you to examine the matter carefully.
