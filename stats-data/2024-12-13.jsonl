영상을 재생합니다.\r\n> \r\n> 증상 : 영상을 재생하면 잠시동안 검은 화면이 뜨고(내 생각엔 이게 광고를 스킵하는 시간과 비슷한 것 같다) 광고 없이 영상이 잘 재생됨. 정확히 1분이 재생되고나면 재생이 멈추고 무한 로딩. 좀 기다리면 오류 창이 뜸. 오류창에 있는 버튼을 눌러보면 해당 오류가 광고 차단때문일 수 있다는 페이지로 연결됨.\r\n> \r\n> 해결 방법을 찾아보던 중, 브라우저 캐시, 웹사이트 데이터를 지우고 필터 업데이트를 하라는 지침이 있어 해 봤지만 효과가 없었음. \r\n> \r\n> 다른 광고차단 프로그램, 보안 프로그램은 일절 사용하지 않음. \r\n> \r\n> Adguard를 비활성화하면 광고가 뜨지만, 1분 넘게 재생해도 멈추지 않고 잘 재생됨.\r\n> \r\n> How to reproduce: Play a video on YouTube.\r\n> \r\n> Symptom: When I play a video, it goes to a black screen for a few seconds (I think this is similar to the time it takes to skip an ad) and then the video plays fine with no ads. After exactly 1 minute of playback, it stops playing and loads indefinitely. After a while, an error window pops up. I pressed the button on the error window and was directed to a page that said the error could be due to ad blocking.\r\n> \r\n> I tried clearing my browser cache, website data, cookies, and updating filters, but none of these worked. \r\n> \r\n> I don't use any other ad blockers or security programs. \r\n> \r\n> When I disable Adguard, ad shows up, but it doesn't stop playing for over a minute.\r\nUsername: `@stodjzfxjfxjfjfzgkktsbcn`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/kcmonqi1k3k0gkwoow48s8coo48gkkg7cb0od7s3xo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.7\r\nSystem version: | 18.1.1(22B91)\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Adguard DNS`<br>filters: `Adguard DNS Filter`, `List-kr DNS`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>List-KR, <br/>YousList\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2541474507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-12-13T13:32:50Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
