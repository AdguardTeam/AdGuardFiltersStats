When AdGuard DNS is enabled, I've noticed that the quick access icons on the homepage of Samsung Internet disappear, and the autofill feature, which I rely on heavily with Bitwarden, stops functioning properly. These issues only occur after completely uninstalling and reinstalling Samsung Internet, then toggling AdGuard DNS on. It's a bit of a bummer because these features are super useful in my day-to-day browsing.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/97r6zmg9liko4os0sgw0ck848o0gookbzmoqwb4g04.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/c2lqq6n3p9kosw8gw8gckgs48c8swc4l6939audytw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bfsoj9sz2q88sc88sg0ckgosowokwss816kde13cdo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6voxcja81xwcwc4gw4oocows08sogsobd57vpmnc88.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Samsung Browser","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/190637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/190637/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-10-10T15:52:55Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
