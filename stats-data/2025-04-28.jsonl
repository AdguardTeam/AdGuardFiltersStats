На мобильной платформе Алибаба не открывается файлы, документы, фото и видео. Мой мобильный оператор лайф, говорит что никаких блокировок через него нет. Отключаю оператора лайф, подключаю оператора скиф, всё открывает. На других ресурсах таких проблем нет, например ютуб или тик-ток. В данный момент происходит в мобильном приложении андроид. В ПК виндовс, таких проблем нет.\r\nUsername: `@Владимир`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

На мобильной платформе Алибаба не открывается файлы, документы, фото и видео. Мой мобильный оператор лайф, говорит что никаких блокировок через него нет. Отключаю оператора лайф, подключаю оператора скиф, всё открывает. На других ресурсах таких проблем нет, например ютуб или тик-ток. В данный момент происходит в мобильном приложении андроид. В ПК виндовс, таких проблем нет.\r\nUsername: `@Владимир`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/94jez7xfre4ooc0kg8ogg0wkg4ws0k0hw8juqlood4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/go48vmipu08owowkgkg88gg8sg4w4osmblgqkry9jk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ro3tkr2tjr4w8wswkc8sco4cowoc48cpannbpy6x68.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/20zffik1tb0g0k8k8884kg4kgoo8g0ks8ze5rgzltw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8jmgvcn21k84og00ocgcs008o44ws4ssdoq3ajook0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 6 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 6](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6r4he6uikcwssoso8w84gw8w4wg0k4kfeein443eao.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 7 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 7](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/f8zw4z3epds0sw0400osog8ckwc4gco954enktq1u8.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 8 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 8](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qgq1d74qnf48cggw4kc04wok4gwkcsw6btysxdjods.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 9 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 9](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/o2petcien5co0c0o44s4sgkkosg8owontehtnul6ys.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 10 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 10](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6w5m5he5w8cog8gw04g48o48ooc0w8s8riimdedrlk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6vv4s1pql0w8cggos8kckskgk00ooocfhm7paooldk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.9\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Яндекс Браузер\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | нет","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204143/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-28T08:43:40Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Обращался к вам на почту - показали скриншот с доводами о том, что с вашей стороны блокировки ip нет.

На мобильной платформе Алибаба не открывается файлы, документы, фото и видео. Мой мобильный оператор лайф, говорит что никаких блокировок через него нет. Отключаю оператора лайф, подключаю оператора скиф, всё открывает. На других ресурсах таких проблем нет, например ютуб или тик-ток. В данный момент происходит в мобильном приложении андроид. В ПК виндовс, таких проблем нет.\r\nUsername: `@Владимир`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

На мобильной платформе Алибаба не открывается файлы, документы, фото и видео. Мой мобильный оператор лайф, говорит что никаких блокировок через него нет. Отключаю оператора лайф, подключаю оператора скиф, всё открывает. На других ресурсах таких проблем нет, например ютуб или тик-ток. В данный момент происходит в мобильном приложении андроид. В ПК виндовс, таких проблем нет.\r\nUsername: `@Владимир`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

На мобильной платформе Алибаба не открывается файлы, документы, фото и видео. Мой мобильный оператор лайф, говорит что никаких блокировок через него нет. Отключаю оператора лайф, подключаю оператора скиф, всё открывает. На других ресурсах таких проблем нет, например ютуб или тик-ток. В данный момент происходит в мобильном приложении андроид. В ПК виндовс, таких проблем нет.\r\nUsername: `@Владимир`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
