Смена dns сервера на любой, отличный от AdGuard решает проблему. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pyrqtj0w2yskkgs48k4oocsw08g8c84f6szttjje1s.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/rczefcb40ys4s48c444sc0os8o8soooprfvh30kbms.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.8\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>AdGuard Experimental, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-02-03T04:36:11Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
