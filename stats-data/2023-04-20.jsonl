AdGuard is set - MSN ads appear when using ad block, or when turning it off for the site.   Previously I was able to block elements from the old adguard link that was available in the sub-menu.  when trying to block ads from the new adguard extension that appears in the address bar, there is no way to select the element to block, either from the rotating ads at the top of the page, or from the banner in the middle of the page.   i have been dealing with this for over a month and i cannot get any assistance from you guys whatsoever.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/bAkRzDB.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.4\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `adguard`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131852/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1515957172","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131852#issuecomment-1515957172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131852","id":1515957172,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85aW6u0","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-20T08:48:12Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T08:48:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Spok1 \r\n\r\n> Можно поинтересоваться для чего этот синтаксис используется?\r\n\r\nПравило JS.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1515957172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-04-20T08:48:13Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

variety of third-party DNS providers, along with the regular AdGuard DNS, return the correct IP addresses for Etsy, but AdGuard Family returns 94.140.14.35 as the IP address for www.etsy.com;  that turns out to be the blocked-site page, which fails with a privacy error because the blocked-site page does not have a TLS certificate for etsy.com and that domain has HSTS (one of the bundled HSTS pins in recent browsers), so the TLS failure cannot be bypassed (I forgot to open the \"Advanced\" button when taking that screenshot, but that's basically what that message said).\r\n> \r\n> I fail to see how Etsy qualifies as \"adult content\" worthy of blocking via the family filter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
