variety of third-party DNS providers, along with the regular AdGuard DNS, return the correct IP addresses for Etsy, but AdGuard Family returns 94.140.14.35 as the IP address for www.etsy.com;  that turns out to be the blocked-site page, which fails with a privacy error because the blocked-site page does not have a TLS certificate for etsy.com and that domain has HSTS (one of the bundled HSTS pins in recent browsers), so the TLS failure cannot be bypassed (I forgot to open the \"Advanced\" button when taking that screenshot, but that's basically what that message said).\r\n> \r\n> I fail to see how Etsy qualifies as \"adult content\" worthy of blocking via the family filter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

that if I search for certain content, I end up with a blank page.  The search results will briefly flash on the screen before the page goes blank.  After doing a bunch of random searches, it seems this is only an issue when searching for TV shows or movies.  If I search for a person, place or thing, I have not had any issues.  When Adguard is off, I have no issues.  \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/e4kLTtT.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/3421g1l.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.11\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | proxy\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nUserscripts: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1516257817","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512#issuecomment-1516257817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512","id":1516257817,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85aYEIZ","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-20T12:40:08Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T12:40:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Cannot reproduce.

that if I search for certain content, I end up with a blank page.  The search results will briefly flash on the screen before the page goes blank.  After doing a bunch of random searches, it seems this is only an issue when searching for TV shows or movies.  If I search for a person, place or thing, I have not had any issues.  When Adguard is off, I have no issues.  \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/e4kLTtT.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/3421g1l.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.11\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | proxy\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nUserscripts: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1516417589","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512#issuecomment-1516417589","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148512","id":1516417589,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85aYrI1","user":{"login":"herr-el","id":131377267,"node_id":"U_kgDOB9Socw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131377267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el","html_url":"https://github.com/herr-el","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herr-el/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-20T14:20:34Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T14:20:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"No, does not work with disabled other browser extensions.\r\n\r\nNo filter to block the content.
