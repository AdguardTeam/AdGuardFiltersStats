Here is a simple example of the issue(see screenshot). So far what's worked for me was to create those two rules:\r\n\r\n   `@@||akamai-video-content.com^$xmlhttprequest`\r\n   `@@||lvturbo.com^$xmlhttprequest`\r\n\r\n   but i'm not sure that this is the proper way and i'm worry that my browser is more exposed this way.\r\n   Please advise.\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot ☝️ :</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- paste screenshot here --> \r\n![CORS](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/34774426/21ab6df2-dd38-4183-8b1b-3d4cde7b9b65)\r\n\r\n</details> \r\n\r\n2. <comment> Would also need some help properly removing HTML element(see screenshot).
