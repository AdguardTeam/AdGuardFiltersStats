Here is a simple example of the issue(see screenshot). So far what's worked for me was to create those two rules:\r\n\r\n   `@@||akamai-video-content.com^$xmlhttprequest`\r\n   `@@||lvturbo.com^$xmlhttprequest`\r\n\r\n   but i'm not sure that this is the proper way and i'm worry that my browser is more exposed this way.\r\n   Please advise.\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot ☝️ :</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- paste screenshot here --> \r\n![CORS](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/34774426/21ab6df2-dd38-4183-8b1b-3d4cde7b9b65)\r\n\r\n</details> \r\n\r\n2. <comment> Would also need some help properly removing HTML element(see screenshot).

by the government multiple times, so the website jumped domains a couple of times. It used eksisozluk2023.com, eksisozluk42.com and now, the latest version is eksisozluk1923.com. So, there are a couple of very annoying ad related issues that Adguard Turkish solves, like if you click a link on the website, it triggers something but since ads are blocked, nothing happens. You need to double click every link. So, if you could move the domain to eksisozluk1923.com or something with a wildcard like eksisozluk*.com, it would really help.

Please try again when you're back online\".\r\n> I have looked in the filtering log and occasionally see requests being blocked, but not every time I try to log in, only occasionally. I have tried adding exceptions for the requests being blocked, but this doesn't seem to have helped (even after a restart and shoppix-app reinstall). \r\n> If I disable 'Route traffic through AdGuard' for this specific app in the AdGuard settings, I am able to login in again. If I then re-enable 'Route traffic through AdGuard' whilst the shoppix app is still running, it acts as if it doesn't have an internet connection, insisting that it is offline. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/RwqiFAn.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/21n4o6I.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.0.788\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS (DNS-over-HTTPS)`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nUserscripts: | If extensions have become userscripts in the beta, then I use AdGuard extension. \r\nThe beta also doesn't appear to have stealth mode as an option, or filtering method (high quality Vs high speed)\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-16T11:51:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

It used eksisozluk2023.com, eksisozluk42.com and now, the latest version is eksisozluk1923.com. So, there are a couple of very annoying ad related issues that Adguard Turkish solves, like if you click a link on the website, it triggers something but since ads are blocked, nothing happens. You need to double click every link. So, if you could move the domain to eksisozluk1923.com or something with a wildcard like eksisozluk*.com, it would really help.
