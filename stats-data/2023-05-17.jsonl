The share panel in the shorts player doesn't have an embed button and a social icon (either WhatsApp if you're logged out or Facebook if you're logged in) wasn't being affected by the old filter. With this fix it should work both on the normal and the shorts player. I also removed the filter: `youtube.com##button[title=\"WhatsApp\"]` because it shouldn't be needed anymore.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Before:</summary>\r\n\r\n<img

The share panel in the shorts player doesn't have an embed button and a social icon (either WhatsApp if you're logged out or Facebook if you're logged in) wasn't being affected by the old filter. With this fix it should work both on the normal and the shorts player. I also removed the filter: `youtube.com##button[title=\"WhatsApp\"]` because it shouldn't be needed anymore.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Before:</summary>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/27850212c333e6fc4e6d9b504781dfd0f77e0d96ad8cb3cf734933b5bd401029/68747470733a2f2f7265706f7274732d696d672e616467756172642e636f6d2f513746447566672e706e67\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>After:</summary>\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/106120144/278388ae-9c8f-49a0-a830-9b47fdf814c1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are met\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150925/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150925/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1550870742","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pull/150925#issuecomment-1550870742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150925","id":1550870742,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85ccGjW","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-17T07:12:43Z","updated_at":"2023-05-17T07:12:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Can't reproduce\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Details</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/8361299/595e6bd4-8287-48d3-8539-a893e5c8694d)\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nWe use two rules to awoid of using extended css.
