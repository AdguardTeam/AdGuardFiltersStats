Comment\r\n> adguard extension fails to retrieve the list data. Once it is added to custom filters, clicking on \"update lists\" does not update this list. The list needs to be deleted and re-added manually in order to work. Not sure what causes this, the other custom filters I added work as intended. This does not happen on the android version, the current version (29December2023v2 as you can see in the screenshot I took) is correctly downloaded. The browser extension straight up ignores new updates (version showed in the custom filters section doesn't increase), not sure if windows app is affected.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/i3pye8arb1ko0ssc4k4gcggw4kwo8w02l5f31iyq6g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3xag1w74h2wwkgw0csoggowo4sk840wr5bht7mssms.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.2.241\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nStealth mode options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>EasyList Italy","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1880825426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-08T11:29:03Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I was unable to do anything on my phone. Everything started to freeze up. But I noticed that the network data was still going back and forward and maintained connection even after I turn off the Data Connection. \r\n> \r\n> It was going on for about 30 to 40 minutes. The were files being transferred. There were modification made to the system files. There were lotsa new files appeared and the movements of flipping the pages in my phone seemed to be not as smooth as always.\r\n> \r\n> I have Adguard installed. I could see there were a lot of scripts with weird Domain names. I'm not sure what to call of such a things happening to my phone. All I could say is thats not normal.\r\n> \r\n> Would u help me on this matter? I do think my phone currently is being controlled by someone, other than me. \r\n> \r\n> What sort of advice n service that u might be able to offer me?\r\nUsername: `@schizobyproxygmail.com`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/j8jieg833lwk0k0kgscsc0www4s4sscsqv1b7iwllw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.3.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Opera\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | disabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://family.cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170196/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-08T16:00:27Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
