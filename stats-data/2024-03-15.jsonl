problem with ad blocking on the Disney+ Android Mobile application.  I have the version of Disney+ with ads and when I get to a point where there are ads, Adguard blocks the ads but I lose a few seconds of the video, it skips a song and even if I go back impossible to see the song that was skipped. I haven't had this problem since Dinsey+ on browser. I think the problem comes from blocking the url \"eu-west-1.ads.digital.disneyadvertising.com\". \n\n### Privacy\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1999124828","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174633#issuecomment-1999124828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174633","id":1999124828,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM853KDlc","user":{"login":"Barzaquaa","id":60731844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzMxODQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60731844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa","html_url":"https://github.com/Barzaquaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-15T08:03:57Z","updated_at":"2024-03-15T08:03:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"On Disney+, the ads are really randomly placed.

Unlike on PC, where blocking the script makes the ad frame disappear, the iframe remains on iPhone, making it natural for the ad frame to still be visible.

problem with ad blocking on the Disney+ Android Mobile application.  I have the version of Disney+ with ads and when I get to a point where there are ads, Adguard blocks the ads but I lose a few seconds of the video, it skips a song and even if I go back impossible to see the song that was skipped. I haven't had this problem since Dinsey+ on browser. I think the problem comes from blocking the url \"eu-west-1.ads.digital.disneyadvertising.com\". \n\n### Privacy\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1999348015","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174633#issuecomment-1999348015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174633","id":1999348015,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM853K6Ev","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-15T10:17:57Z","updated_at":"2024-03-15T10:17:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Barzaquaa Ok.
