Your comment\r\n\r\nWe never have catched up with their update cycle. We have to try aggressive regex rule(s) that will be injected to some benign sites too, hence made `prevent-window-open` more specific. I'd not even `example.*##.ad` can be applied to benign sites too. I suspect `[$domain=/^filemoon-.*\\.xyz/]` is obsolete now. As commented in Slack, it looks `{n,m}` is incompatible, but I meant `{5,8}` with the rules.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private

We have to try aggressive regex rule(s) that will be injected to some benign sites too, hence made `prevent-window-open` more specific. I'd not even `example.*##.ad` can be applied to benign sites too. I suspect `[$domain=/^filemoon-.*\\.xyz/]` is obsolete now.

It does not occur much on the M1 iPad, but switching tabs causes reloading. I think that was caused by high memory usage.\r\n> \r\n> Also, when you search for a product on Rakuten, the product will be displayed with [PR] at the top.

the large majority of users do not create accounts on Github just to report an issue, and it’s rare for non-developers to use the site.  Furthermore, most people never report bugs, or even search for or inquire about their existence even being a possibility.\n\nWhen you have a chance, can you please test this on someone else’s computer (a non-technical person, like a family member) to ensure that it’s not something you have set up in your controlled environment that is allowing it to load properly?

not be cropped too much.

ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript.

It can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> Saving memory feature of your web browser or sleep feature of your operating system can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n> In this case, please re-enable AdGuard's filtering by toggling the protection toggle.\n> Following the instructions can be needed.\n\n### The instructions\n1. Force to update the filters by clicking the reload button in AdGuard Browser Extension/AdGuard mobile or update tray menu in your system tray. [^2]\n2. Reload the YouTube webpage without cache by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> [^3].\n3. Clear cache, cookies and site data of your web browser.\n4.

ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript.
