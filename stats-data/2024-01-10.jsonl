Seems to be caused by the AdGuard Base filter.\r\n> \r\n> Steps to reproduce:\r\n> -Visit page with Base filter enabled\r\n> -Visit page with Base filter disabled\r\n> -Compare articles from both visits\r\n> \r\n> The issue appears with both AdGuard Android and AdGuard Browser Extension on Windows. On Windows there's just a big black space instead of the missing articles (no screenshot available at the moment), whereas on Android there's no black space.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/91xb7u14o54w08sogg84ckwcc4wswsscgf8qwx8qa0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/plojk20bh2s8w4ookso4kw4ccgc4400f86n3rha14o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.3.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Adguard`, `DNS`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170303/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-10T08:17:50Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
