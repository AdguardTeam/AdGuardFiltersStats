gets stuck on ads sometimes on web player with AdGuard enabled - no songs, nothing, not even ad plays. Only solution is to refresh the browser and replay the playlist. Trying to change playlist doesn't work either, completely stuck playerand now playing view. While with AdGuard disabled, ads load normally and player works as intended. One important thing: It happens after 2-3 times ads are skipped. e.g I open player, play a playlist, ads come normally due course, gets skipped twice or even thrice, songs playing uninterrupted, after that it gets stuck on ad and nothing plays. Like spotify detects adblocker is on after 2-3 skips and blocks plays (guess).\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/83mi74u948w0g4kgws88k0sg8g8k4sg9pssix2rkdg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/2vay4knk3su8oowwo0ko4og4c880sgonwbv61x27r4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.2.500.7 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 11`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880)\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>IndianList\r\nFilters last update: | December 01, 2025 at 09:00\r\nOther extensions used: | `TempMail`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=ext&product_version=5.2.500.7&system_version=Windows+11&manifest_version=3&browser=chrome&filters=2.3.4.17.18.19.20.21.22.208.253.255&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.strip_url=true&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_trackers=true&filters_last_update=2025-12-01T09%3A00%3A45)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/219734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/219734/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"assignee":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-12-12T10:28:56Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

The filter: `nytimes.com##.StoryBodyCompanionColumn > div[class^=\"css-\"] > p[class^=\"css-\"]:has(> a[href^=\"https://www.nytimes.com/subscription\"])`   \nwill hide a line saying:  \n`[Subscribe to The Times](https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=8WXW7) to read as many articles as you like.`  \nWhich might seem a good thing. But, the line is only visible if user is not a paying reader and is using a method of half-disabling a soft-wall. Meaning they just hide overlying dialogs and enable page scrolling.   \nBut the line (or something there) is important, as it's a sign that the article is not complete.  \nAnd from experience, this happens a lot. Readers just think the article is short and they see it wholly.  \nTo make it more obvious for them, I even added another, more obvious line saying the article is not complete.   \nFurthermore for my case, when an AD blocker hides this line, my Note is hidden with it, but I'd just move it to a previous sibling if you'd decide to keep the filter.\n\nPlease consider removing this filter, or adding a similar note.\n\nthe note:\n```\n  .meteredContent > div:last-of-type p:last-of-type:has(a[href^=\"https://www.nytimes.com/subscription\"])::before {\n    content: \"The rest of the article is visible to paying subscribers only.\";\n    display: block;\n    /* \ttext-align: center; */\n    color: #666;\n    font-size: 18px;\n    font-family: nyt-franklin, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\n    line-height: 1rem;\n    border-top: thin solid red;\n    border-bottom: thin solid red;\n    background: black;\n    padding-bottom: 2px;\n  }\n```\n\n2.

The filter: `nytimes.com##.StoryBodyCompanionColumn > div[class^=\"css-\"] > p[class^=\"css-\"]:has(> a[href^=\"https://www.nytimes.com/subscription\"])`   \nwill hide a line saying:  \n`[Subscribe to The Times](https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=8WXW7) to read as many articles as you like.`  \nWhich might seem a good thing. But, the line is only visible if user is not a paying reader and is using a method of half-disabling a soft-wall. Meaning they just hide overlying dialogs and enable page scrolling.   \nBut the line (or something there) is important, as it's a sign that the article is not complete.  \nAnd from experience, this happens a lot. Readers just think the article is short and they see it wholly.  \nTo make it more obvious for them, I even added another, more obvious line saying the article is not complete.   \nFurthermore for my case, when an AD blocker hides this line, my Note is hidden with it, but I'd just move it to a previous sibling if you'd decide to keep the filter.\n\nPlease consider removing this filter, or adding a similar note.\n\nthe note:\n```\n  .meteredContent > div:last-of-type p:last-of-type:has(a[href^=\"https://www.nytimes.com/subscription\"])::before {\n    content: \"The rest of the article is visible to paying subscribers only.\";\n    display: block;\n    /* \ttext-align: center; */\n    color: #666;\n    font-size: 18px;\n    font-family: nyt-franklin, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\n    line-height: 1rem;\n    border-top: thin solid red;\n    border-bottom: thin solid red;\n    background: black;\n    padding-bottom: 2px;\n  }\n```\n\n2.

The filter: `nytimes.com##.StoryBodyCompanionColumn > div[class^=\"css-\"] > p[class^=\"css-\"]:has(> a[href^=\"https://www.nytimes.com/subscription\"])`   \nwill hide a line saying:  \n`[Subscribe to The Times](https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=8WXW7) to read as many articles as you like.`  \nWhich might seem a good thing. But, the line is only visible if user is not a paying reader and is using a method of half-disabling a soft-wall. Meaning they just hide overlying dialogs and enable page scrolling.   \nBut the line (or something there) is important, as it's a sign that the article is not complete.  \nAnd from experience, this happens a lot. Readers just think the article is short and they see it wholly.  \nTo make it more obvious for them, I even added another, more obvious line saying the article is not complete.   \nFurthermore for my case, when an AD blocker hides this line, my Note is hidden with it, but I'd just move it to a previous sibling if you'd decide to keep the filter.\n\nPlease consider removing this filter, or adding a similar note.\n\nthe note:\n```\n  .meteredContent > div:last-of-type p:last-of-type:has(a[href^=\"https://www.nytimes.com/subscription\"])::before {\n    content: \"The rest of the article is visible to paying subscribers only.\";\n    display: block;\n    /* \ttext-align: center; */\n    color: #666;\n    font-size: 18px;\n    font-family: nyt-franklin, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\n    line-height: 1rem;\n    border-top: thin solid red;\n    border-bottom: thin solid red;\n    background: black;\n    padding-bottom: 2px;\n  }\n```\n\n2.

The filter: `nytimes.com##.StoryBodyCompanionColumn > div[class^=\"css-\"] > p[class^=\"css-\"]:has(> a[href^=\"https://www.nytimes.com/subscription\"])`   \nwill hide a line saying:  \n`[Subscribe to The Times](https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=8WXW7) to read as many articles as you like.`  \nWhich might seem a good thing. But, the line is only visible if user is not a paying reader and is using a method of half-disabling a soft-wall. Meaning they just hide overlying dialogs and enable page scrolling.   \nBut the line (or something there) is important, as it's a sign that the article is not complete.  \nAnd from experience, this happens a lot. Readers just think the article is short and they see it wholly.  \nTo make it more obvious for them, I even added another, more obvious line saying the article is not complete.   \nFurthermore for my case, when an AD blocker hides this line, my Note is hidden with it, but I'd just move it to a previous sibling if you'd decide to keep the filter.\n\nPlease consider removing this filter, or adding a similar note.\n\nthe note:\n```\n  .meteredContent > div:last-of-type p:last-of-type:has(a[href^=\"https://www.nytimes.com/subscription\"])::before {\n    content: \"The rest of the article is visible to paying subscribers only.\";\n    display: block;\n    /* \ttext-align: center; */\n    color: #666;\n    font-size: 18px;\n    font-family: nyt-franklin, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\n    line-height: 1rem;\n    border-top: thin solid red;\n    border-bottom: thin solid red;\n    background: black;\n    padding-bottom: 2px;\n  }\n```\n\n2.
