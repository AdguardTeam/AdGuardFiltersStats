description\n\nThe \"I don't care about cookies\" filter description doesn't currently explain if enabling it would cause that the \"cookies consent\" would disapear, automatically agreeing or rejecting the cookies, including the so called \"IAD\" (or whatever shortcut is used for the \"legitimate interest of the administrator\").\r\n\r\nIn many countries, such \"legitimate interest of the

@JohnStephenSimonJr\r\n> When I receive emails from CheaperThanDirt.com and I click on links, with my AdGuard on, I get a message from Microsoft (Edge, Windows something) that says \"Hmmm, Can't link that page.\"  There is a reference to exponea.com.  When I clink on links, with my AdGuard off, I go to the CheaperThanDirt page.\r\n> \r\n> If you look at the Email page I have my cursor on hover and you can see the link is directing me to exponea.com initially which is then, after logging me personally as responding to the email, is directing me to the CheaperThanDirt page.\r\n> \r\n> I looked up exponea.com and it appears to be a legitimate service that outsources management of web based marketing and loyalty programs for various businesses.  I have the same issue with OluKai.com and Lenovo US where I am also a customer with some slight variations, same result - blocked email link.  My semi-educated guess is that something in how exponea grabs my response to track me before sending me to their customer's website sets off AdGuard as I have it configured.  I am guessing that exponea has their system set-up so that if the tracking info is blocked, they don't put the link request through, and the DNS error results. I would presume that I am not the first person to have this issue given exponea's market presence.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/dynmhnckwgoc0kgckkws0ksc80c8o8k8jnuypeeatc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6cqg8ezgmgsgog4cgsgokkogkoskg0g31h064mde2y.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/h45fxr89h7soocoogwcc84o0gsogskwm00v5a9tt00.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.14\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies ()\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Ad Guard`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filters`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Italy\r\nUserscripts: | Automatically Detect User Scripts, Ad Guard Assistant, Ad Guard Extra, Ad Guard Pop-up Blocker, \r\nOther extensions used: | Windows Defender","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/161350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/161350/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-19T16:31:49Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
