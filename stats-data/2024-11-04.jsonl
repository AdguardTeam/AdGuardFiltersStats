This problem presents in all browsers I've tried. Specifically:\r\n> \r\n> With \"AdGuard Base Filter\" ENABLED, the site actively obfuscates the circled promotional elements inside random named DOM elements, shadow roots, etc.\r\n> \r\n> With \"AdGuard Base Filter\" DISABLED these same elements are in easy-to-filter DOM elements.\r\n> \r\n> User rules or userscripts that hide the unwanted elements break when the Base FIlter is active. I have not been able to identify what item(s) in the base filter are triggering eBay to obfuscate the content.

Maybe with a debugger over USB, but I was hoping you may know how to find it.\n\n### Additional information\n\nI have attempted blocking the banner using the uBO element picker, but unfortunately the resulting selector was too broad, and was blocking other elements too, like the menus that appear when the \"3 dot\" or the share menu is opened for a post.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192278/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-04T19:07:33Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Используется обход блокировки для рф (https://github.com/bol-van/zapret-win-bundle). Интересно то, что пару недель назад все работало нормально. Сначала думал на днс, отключил в adguard фильтрацию dns, но не помогло. Добавил в роутере открытые dns Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1), но при включенном adguard не работает ни сайт ни приложение. Как только отключаю adguard сразу начинает грузиться и сайт и приложение.\r\nUsername: `@https://github.com/6epcepkep`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/r7moah104is4g4swcsskk0ssg8oog806gpax93wkjg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/odou0q32gv4k0cw8ogko0k8goo80cc4cxmxwhylai8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.19.0 (4853) (CL 1.16.44, DL 2.5.41 )\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 Домашняя для одного языка 22H2 19045.5073\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your IP address (14.88.10.101), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies, <br>Block trackers, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.info/settings/import.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Flogin%3Fredirect_to%3D%252Foauth2%252Fauthorize%253Fresponse_type%253Dcode%2526client_id%253D493224032167002123%2526redirect_uri%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fdiscords.com%25252Fauth%25252Fdiscord%25252Fcallback%2526scope%253Dguilds%252Bidentify%252Bguilds.join%2526state%253DPNaSf2TnXChBEhvloLjtNXhRsPEMhu)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192194/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2455894235","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192194#issuecomment-2455894235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192194","id":2455894235,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86SYfjb","user":{"login":"Radionucleid","id":26021421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDIxNDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26021421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Radionucleid","html_url":"https://github.com/Radionucleid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Radionucleid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Radionucleid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Radionucleid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Radionucleid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Radionucleid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Radionucleid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Radionucleid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Radionucleid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Radionucleid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-04T23:16:10Z","updated_at":"2024-11-04T23:16:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Тоже самое, подтверждаю.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2455894235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-04T23:16:12Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

ATTENTION\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.
