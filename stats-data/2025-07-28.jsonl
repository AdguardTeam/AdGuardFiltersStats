ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://facebook.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffacebook.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> After recent app update the Facebook won't load with adguard enabled neither on Chrome or Firefox. It just loads the white screen. Disabling entire Adguard or just Adguard Tracking Protection Filter fixes the issue. However it's very annoying that it needs to be done every time. Especially that it worked without extra steps until the recent app/filter update. Not sure which one broke it. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/qlvuxsxyig0kgwwgc0coko8s8cgow84k896lk0rkqo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/aiejj106yy8s08gocos4gg00s4sk00wclkgpu4pc4g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.21.1\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID, <br>Disable Windows Defender automatic samples submission, <br>Disable WAP Push Message Routing Service\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Adguard DNS`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `None`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=Adguard+DNS)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3126285716","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220#issuecomment-3126285716","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220","id":3126285716,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM866V1WU","user":{"login":"k13rownik","id":223245334,"node_id":"U_kgDODU50Fg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/223245334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik","html_url":"https://github.com/k13rownik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-28T09:10:14Z","updated_at":"2025-07-28T09:10:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm not sure why this is happening but anything I tried it just doesn't fix it.

Facebook won't load with adguard enabled neither on Chrome or Firefox. It just loads the white screen. Disabling entire Adguard or just Adguard Tracking Protection Filter fixes the issue. However it's very annoying that it needs to be done every time.

Facebook won't load with adguard enabled neither on Chrome or Firefox. It just loads the white screen. Disabling entire Adguard or just Adguard Tracking Protection Filter fixes the issue. However it's very annoying that it needs to be done every time.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://facebook.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffacebook.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> After recent app update the Facebook won't load with adguard enabled neither on Chrome or Firefox. It just loads the white screen. Disabling entire Adguard or just Adguard Tracking Protection Filter fixes the issue. However it's very annoying that it needs to be done every time. Especially that it worked without extra steps until the recent app/filter update. Not sure which one broke it. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/qlvuxsxyig0kgwwgc0coko8s8cgow84k896lk0rkqo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/aiejj106yy8s08gocos4gg00s4sk00wclkgpu4pc4g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.21.1\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID, <br>Disable Windows Defender automatic samples submission, <br>Disable WAP Push Message Routing Service\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Adguard DNS`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `None`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=Adguard+DNS)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3126394390","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220#issuecomment-3126394390","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220","id":3126394390,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM866WP4W","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-28T09:39:12Z","updated_at":"2025-07-28T09:39:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Could you please try to manually update filters and then check again?\nIf problem still continues please open filter editor, open `AdGuard Tracking Protection filter`, search for `facebook`, select all rules (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>), click right mouse button on any of the rule, disable all of them temporary, wait few seconds until changes will be applied and check if problem still occurs.\n\n<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>\n\n<img width=\"2559\" height=\"1310\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52e06ac5-7eea-4b79-b68c-40b28b048dce\" />\n\n</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3126394390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-28T09:39:13Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Facebook won't load with adguard enabled neither on Chrome or Firefox. It just loads the white screen. Disabling entire Adguard or just Adguard Tracking Protection Filter fixes the issue. However it's very annoying that it needs to be done every time. Especially that it worked without extra steps until the recent app/filter update.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://facebook.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffacebook.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> After recent app update the Facebook won't load with adguard enabled neither on Chrome or Firefox. It just loads the white screen. Disabling entire Adguard or just Adguard Tracking Protection Filter fixes the issue. However it's very annoying that it needs to be done every time. Especially that it worked without extra steps until the recent app/filter update. Not sure which one broke it. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/qlvuxsxyig0kgwwgc0coko8s8cgow84k896lk0rkqo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/aiejj106yy8s08gocos4gg00s4sk00wclkgpu4pc4g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.21.1\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID, <br>Disable Windows Defender automatic samples submission, <br>Disable WAP Push Message Routing Service\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Adguard DNS`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `None`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=Adguard+DNS)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3127490459","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220#issuecomment-3127490459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220","id":3127490459,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM866abeb","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-28T14:26:08Z","updated_at":"2025-07-28T14:26:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Adding `facebook.com` to HTTPS exceptions is like disabling filtering.\nPlease try to add following rules one by one (if the one rule does not work, please disable/remove it and check the next one):\n1.

Facebook won't load with adguard enabled neither on Chrome or Firefox. It just loads the white screen. Disabling entire Adguard or just Adguard Tracking Protection Filter fixes the issue. However it's very annoying that it needs to be done every time. Especially that it worked without extra steps until the recent app/filter update. Not sure which one broke it. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/qlvuxsxyig0kgwwgc0coko8s8cgow84k896lk0rkqo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/aiejj106yy8s08gocos4gg00s4sk00wclkgpu4pc4g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.21.1\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID, <br>Disable Windows Defender automatic samples submission, <br>Disable WAP Push Message Routing Service\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Adguard DNS`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `None`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=Adguard+DNS)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3127728814","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220#issuecomment-3127728814","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220","id":3127728814,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM866bVqu","user":{"login":"k13rownik","id":223245334,"node_id":"U_kgDODU50Fg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/223245334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik","html_url":"https://github.com/k13rownik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-28T15:20:36Z","updated_at":"2025-07-28T15:20:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Adding `facebook.com` to HTTPS exceptions is like disabling filtering.
