ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.

ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.

It just loads the white screen. Disabling entire Adguard or just Adguard Tracking Protection Filter fixes the issue. However it's very annoying that it needs to be done every time. Especially that it worked without extra steps until the recent app/filter update.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://facebook.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffacebook.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> After recent app update the Facebook won't load with adguard enabled neither on Chrome or Firefox. It just loads the white screen. Disabling entire Adguard or just Adguard Tracking Protection Filter fixes the issue. However it's very annoying that it needs to be done every time. Especially that it worked without extra steps until the recent app/filter update. Not sure which one broke it. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/qlvuxsxyig0kgwwgc0coko8s8cgow84k896lk0rkqo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/aiejj106yy8s08gocos4gg00s4sk00wclkgpu4pc4g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.21.1\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID, <br>Disable Windows Defender automatic samples submission, <br>Disable WAP Push Message Routing Service\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Adguard DNS`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `None`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=Adguard+DNS)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3126285716","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220#issuecomment-3126285716","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220","id":3126285716,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM866V1WU","user":{"login":"k13rownik","id":223245334,"node_id":"U_kgDODU50Fg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/223245334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik","html_url":"https://github.com/k13rownik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k13rownik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-28T09:10:14Z","updated_at":"2025-07-28T09:10:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm not sure why this is happening but anything I tried it just doesn't fix it.

Facebook won't load with adguard enabled neither on Chrome or Firefox. It just loads the white screen. Disabling entire Adguard or just Adguard Tracking Protection Filter fixes the issue. However it's very annoying that it needs to be done every time. Especially that it worked without extra steps until the recent app/filter update. Not sure which one broke it. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/qlvuxsxyig0kgwwgc0coko8s8cgow84k896lk0rkqo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/aiejj106yy8s08gocos4gg00s4sk00wclkgpu4pc4g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.21.1\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID, <br>Disable Windows Defender automatic samples submission, <br>Disable WAP Push Message Routing Service\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Adguard DNS`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `None`\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=Adguard+DNS)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3126219029","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220#issuecomment-3126219029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210220","id":3126219029,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM866VlEV","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-28T08:53:47Z","updated_at":"2025-07-28T08:53:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I cannot reproduce it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3126219029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-28T08:53:48Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Facebook won't load with adguard enabled neither on Chrome or Firefox. It just loads the white screen. Disabling entire Adguard or just Adguard Tracking Protection Filter fixes the issue. However it's very annoying that it needs to be done every time. Especially that it worked without extra steps until the recent app/filter update.
