Что поверх видео открывается второе видео. \r\n> Почему-то по умолчанию он не блокирует его.

Add `dlhd.so#@%#//scriptlet('abort-current-inline-script', 'atob', '/popundersPerIP[\\s\\S]*?Date[\\s\\S]*?getElementsByTagName[\\s\\S]*?insertBefore/')` to reproduce.\r\n\r\n2.

Your comment\r\n\r\nA new pattern of PopAds uncaught by the current rules found on `https://dlhd.so/stream/stream-51.php` I used unique `popads-node` for the regex, but simply generalized the rest of rules as they are relatively safe even without `$header`.  Add `dlhd.so#@%#//scriptlet('abort-current-inline-script', 'atob', '/popundersPerIP[\\s\\S]*?Date[\\s\\S]*?getElementsByTagName[\\s\\S]*?insertBefore/')` to reproduce.\r\n\r\n2.

Add `dlhd.so#@%#//scriptlet('abort-current-inline-script', 'atob', '/popundersPerIP[\\s\\S]*?Date[\\s\\S]*?getElementsByTagName[\\s\\S]*?insertBefore/')` to reproduce.\r\n\r\n2.

Comment\r\n> Просто начать смотреть. Проблема в плеере kodik. Заблокировать в ручном режиме не представляется возможным, по причине что блокируется весь iframe, где и идет воспроизведение видео. Потому что плеер реагирует на интерфейс адблока и невозможно что-либо выбрать, ибо вместо плеера подставляется какая-то фигня, а после скрытия выбора адгуарда, то плеер по новой загружается(сбросив свое состояние просмотра).\r\n> \r\n> P.s чуть полазив, обнаружил такой момент. Что поверх видео открывается второе видео. \r\n> Почему-то по умолчанию он не блокирует его.

Comment\r\n> I use the app “Downie” https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/ to download audio, video, and images from various websites.   One such was of starting a download is to paste the URL of a page that contains the item you want to download.   \r\n> \r\n> This works 100% of the time for everything EXCEPT Twitter.   Excuse me, X.com.   \r\n> \r\n> So say I want to download this gif of a tornado that I just tweeted.  The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.   Disable it and you can now use either x.com or twitter.com URLs.\r\n> \r\n> A while back I THOUGHT i had nailed this down as being related to DNS Protection, which i had  been using at the time.  Seems like when I changed it or disabled it the problem went away, however that is not the case as of now.   So the only workaround is to change the URL manually.\r\nUsername: `@petekjohnson`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
