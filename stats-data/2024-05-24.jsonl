Что поверх видео открывается второе видео. \r\n> Почему-то по умолчанию он не блокирует его.

Add `dlhd.so#@%#//scriptlet('abort-current-inline-script', 'atob', '/popundersPerIP[\\s\\S]*?Date[\\s\\S]*?getElementsByTagName[\\s\\S]*?insertBefore/')` to reproduce.\r\n\r\n2.

Your comment\r\n\r\nA new pattern of PopAds uncaught by the current rules found on `https://dlhd.so/stream/stream-51.php` I used unique `popads-node` for the regex, but simply generalized the rest of rules as they are relatively safe even without `$header`.  Add `dlhd.so#@%#//scriptlet('abort-current-inline-script', 'atob', '/popundersPerIP[\\s\\S]*?Date[\\s\\S]*?getElementsByTagName[\\s\\S]*?insertBefore/')` to reproduce.\r\n\r\n2.

Add `dlhd.so#@%#//scriptlet('abort-current-inline-script', 'atob', '/popundersPerIP[\\s\\S]*?Date[\\s\\S]*?getElementsByTagName[\\s\\S]*?insertBefore/')` to reproduce.\r\n\r\n2.

Comment\r\n> Просто начать смотреть. Проблема в плеере kodik. Заблокировать в ручном режиме не представляется возможным, по причине что блокируется весь iframe, где и идет воспроизведение видео. Потому что плеер реагирует на интерфейс адблока и невозможно что-либо выбрать, ибо вместо плеера подставляется какая-то фигня, а после скрытия выбора адгуарда, то плеер по новой загружается(сбросив свое состояние просмотра).\r\n> \r\n> P.s чуть полазив, обнаружил такой момент. Что поверх видео открывается второе видео. \r\n> Почему-то по умолчанию он не блокирует его.
