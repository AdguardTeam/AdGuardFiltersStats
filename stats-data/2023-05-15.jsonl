The share panel in the shorts player doesn't have an embed button and a social icon (either WhatsApp if you're logged out or Facebook if you're logged in) wasn't being affected by the old filter. With this fix it should work both on the normal and the shorts player. I also removed the filter: `youtube.com##button[title=\"WhatsApp\"]` because it shouldn't be needed anymore.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Before:</summary>\r\n\r\n<img

The share panel in the shorts player doesn't have an embed button and a social icon (either WhatsApp if you're logged out or Facebook if you're logged in) wasn't being affected by the old filter. With this fix it should work both on the normal and the shorts player. I also removed the filter: `youtube.com##button[title=\"WhatsApp\"]` because it shouldn't be needed anymore.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Before:</summary>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/27850212c333e6fc4e6d9b504781dfd0f77e0d96ad8cb3cf734933b5bd401029/68747470733a2f2f7265706f7274732d696d672e616467756172642e636f6d2f513746447566672e706e67\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>After:</summary>\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/106120144/278388ae-9c8f-49a0-a830-9b47fdf814c1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are met\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150925/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150925/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1547267704","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pull/150925#issuecomment-1547267704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150925","id":1547267704,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85cOW54","user":{"login":"krystian3w","id":35370833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzcwODMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35370833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w","html_url":"https://github.com/krystian3w","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-15T06:33:16Z","updated_at":"2023-05-15T06:33:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> ```adb\r\n> youtube.com##button[title=\"WhatsApp\"]\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nThese can be forced for legacy supported iOS 14 and iPadOS 14: https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-4-3-for-ios.html\r\n\r\nUntil google turns it off watch YT on Safari 14.\r\n\r\n> ![screen from devtools, not real iPhone/iPad](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/35370833/736a5056-4b67-4ee4-85c6-c061f406e057 \"screen from devtools, not real iPhone/iPad\")\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1547267704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-15T06:33:16Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

The share panel in the shorts player doesn't have an embed button and a social icon (either WhatsApp if you're logged out or Facebook if you're logged in) wasn't being affected by the old filter. With this fix it should work both on the normal and the shorts player. I also removed the filter: `youtube.com##button[title=\"WhatsApp\"]` because it shouldn't be needed anymore.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Before:</summary>\r\n\r\n<img
