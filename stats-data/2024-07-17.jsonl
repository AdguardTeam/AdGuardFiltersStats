Anyway, glad to hear it.\n\nI haven't updated my phone. You might wonder why. Well, the reason is that I chose not to update it, fearing that doing so would prevent a future ios jailbreak release. The latest changelog of the adguard for ios app mentioned that they removed a workaround used to overcome a bug fixed in the most recent iOS version. Unfortunately, this affected my version (17.3.1). I worried that removing this ad-blocking workaround would worsen an already half-baked adblocking that ios has. Adguard doesn't need to cater to older versions of iOS, so I decided to stick with what I have.

Prerequisites\n\n- [X] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [X] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [X] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nI monitored the site’s connections using Dev Tools and discovered that when opening an article, the site sends requests to stats.habr.com, using the same developer tools I was able to find out that information is sent there that contains at least: ID and type of publication and some then UUID (I don’t have it, maybe registered users have it).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nPerhaps it is worth including stats.habr.com in the list for blocking analytics?\n\n### Additional information\n\nSorry, but I don't want to use your tool to report problems.\r\nSee

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://2gis.ru/moscow](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2F2gis.ru%2Fmoscow)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Если работать с сайтом 2ГИС со смартфона через браузер а не через их мобильное приложение, то если AdGuard включен то невозможно начать пользоваться сайтом поскольку вся страница сайта является затемнённой и не реагирует на касания пользователя. Когда выключил AdGuard то оказалось что AdGuard блокирует один элемент который изначально накладывается на сайт поверх и требует обязательного выбора со стороны пользователя (нужно выбрать и нажать остаться на сайте или перейти в мобильное приложение) (данный элемент скорее всего отображается сайтом не зависимо от того установлено или нет их мобильное приложение, у меня оно не установлено)... Т.е. когда я временно отключил защиту в AdGuard и обновил страницу в браузере то этот элемент появился поверх страницы сайта и после того как я нажал в нём нужную кнопку чтобы остаться на сайте то он пропал но и страница сайта стала не затемнённой и сайтом стало можно пользоватся... Если повторно заходить на сайт не очищая данные браузера то потом уже проблема не повторяется и сайт работает нормально даже с включенным AdGuard, но после очистки данных браузера и при последующем заходе на сайт проблема повторяется снова... Воспроизведение по этому сценарию всегда стабильное... Москва взята только как пример и город по умолчанию на сайте наверное... А так эта проблема воспроизводится для карты любого города... Нужно бы наверное подправить что-то в каком-то из фильтров AdGuard... Заранее спасибо.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://2gis.ru/moscow](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2F2gis.ru%2Fmoscow)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Если работать с сайтом 2ГИС со смартфона через браузер а не через их мобильное приложение, то если AdGuard включен то невозможно начать пользоваться сайтом поскольку вся страница сайта является затемнённой и не реагирует на касания пользователя. Когда выключил AdGuard то оказалось что AdGuard блокирует один элемент который изначально накладывается на сайт поверх и требует обязательного выбора со стороны пользователя (нужно выбрать и нажать остаться на сайте или перейти в мобильное приложение) (данный элемент скорее всего отображается сайтом не зависимо от того установлено или нет их мобильное приложение, у меня оно не установлено)... Т.е. когда я временно отключил защиту в AdGuard и обновил страницу в браузере то этот элемент появился поверх страницы сайта и после того как я нажал в нём нужную кнопку чтобы остаться на сайте то он пропал но и страница сайта стала не затемнённой и сайтом стало можно пользоватся... Если повторно заходить на сайт не очищая данные браузера то потом уже проблема не повторяется и сайт работает нормально даже с включенным AdGuard, но после очистки данных браузера и при последующем заходе на сайт проблема повторяется снова... Воспроизведение по этому сценарию всегда стабильное... Москва взята только как пример и город по умолчанию на сайте наверное... А так эта проблема воспроизводится для карты любого города... Нужно бы наверное подправить что-то в каком-то из фильтров AdGuard... Заранее спасибо.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://2gis.ru/moscow](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2F2gis.ru%2Fmoscow)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Если работать с сайтом 2ГИС со смартфона через браузер а не через их мобильное приложение, то если AdGuard включен то невозможно начать пользоваться сайтом поскольку вся страница сайта является затемнённой и не реагирует на касания пользователя. Когда выключил AdGuard то оказалось что AdGuard блокирует один элемент который изначально накладывается на сайт поверх и требует обязательного выбора со стороны пользователя (нужно выбрать и нажать остаться на сайте или перейти в мобильное приложение) (данный элемент скорее всего отображается сайтом не зависимо от того установлено или нет их мобильное приложение, у меня оно не установлено)... Т.е. когда я временно отключил защиту в AdGuard и обновил страницу в браузере то этот элемент появился поверх страницы сайта и после того как я нажал в нём нужную кнопку чтобы остаться на сайте то он пропал но и страница сайта стала не затемнённой и сайтом стало можно пользоватся... Если повторно заходить на сайт не очищая данные браузера то потом уже проблема не повторяется и сайт работает нормально даже с включенным AdGuard, но после очистки данных браузера и при последующем заходе на сайт проблема повторяется снова... Воспроизведение по этому сценарию всегда стабильное... Москва взята только как пример и город по умолчанию на сайте наверное... А так эта проблема воспроизводится для карты любого города... Нужно бы наверное подправить что-то в каком-то из фильтров AdGuard... Заранее спасибо.

Когда выключил AdGuard то оказалось что AdGuard блокирует один элемент который изначально накладывается на сайт поверх и требует обязательного выбора со стороны пользователя (нужно выбрать и нажать остаться на сайте или перейти в мобильное приложение) (данный элемент скорее всего отображается сайтом не зависимо от того установлено или нет их мобильное приложение, у меня оно не установлено)... Т.е. когда я временно отключил защиту в AdGuard и обновил страницу в браузере то этот элемент появился поверх страницы сайта и после того как я нажал в нём нужную кнопку чтобы остаться на сайте то он пропал но и страница сайта стала не затемнённой и сайтом стало можно пользоватся... Если повторно заходить на сайт не очищая данные браузера то потом уже проблема не повторяется и сайт работает нормально даже с включенным AdGuard, но после очистки данных браузера и при последующем заходе на сайт проблема повторяется снова... Воспроизведение по этому сценарию всегда стабильное... Москва взята только как пример и город по умолчанию на сайте наверное... А так эта проблема воспроизводится для карты любого города... Нужно бы наверное подправить что-то в каком-то из фильтров AdGuard... Заранее спасибо.
