I've noticed a significant slowdown in loading Youtube pages with AdGuard enabled. I've updated all filters, but the apparent deliberate slowness does not go away unless I disable AdGuard and then Youtube appears to load correctly.  Often it will take 5-10secs to load a specific page. Processor usage for the Youtube specific page within Safari is also going beyond 100% during the attempts to load the site.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/84tboe1v5e04k4sswocccc4g4kswgs8jriysdps2xc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.16\r\nSystem version: | MacOS 14.2.1\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/171075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/171075/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1912908852","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/171075#issuecomment-1912908852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/171075","id":1912908852,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85yBKw0","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-27T01:50:21Z","updated_at":"2024-01-27T01:50:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://youtube.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Adgaurd slows YouTube down.\r\nUsername: `@trayjaynow929`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hl4ko8042hw0cgsoc4oogcwk8og4ckko5o5tvoi8ao.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6m0qce08nvcwo40ksk0g0k8kw84scs4cgrs8gl48nc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.16\r\nSystem version: | Mac OS Sonoma, 14.3\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List\r\nOther extensions used: | N/A","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1912908852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-27T01:50:22Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Anti Adblock Script)\r\n [http://youtube.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> For the last couple of days I've noticed a significant slowdown in loading Youtube pages with AdGuard enabled. I've updated all filters, but the apparent deliberate slowness does not go away unless I disable AdGuard and then Youtube appears to load correctly.  Often it will take 5-10secs to load a specific page. Processor usage for the Youtube specific page within Safari is also going beyond 100% during the attempts to load the site.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/84tboe1v5e04k4sswocccc4g4kswgs8jriysdps2xc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.16\r\nSystem version: | MacOS 14.2.1\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/171075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/171075/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-27T01:50:21Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
