[#164590 (comment)](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/164590#issuecomment-1781734622) @Divin1ty666 you should enable AdGuard Russian, also install AdGuard Extra.\r\n> \r\n> This issue is known to be solved with [AdGuard Extra](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardExtra) userscript.\r\n> \r\n> If you’re using AdGuard for Windows, Mac or Android, please make sure that AdGuard Extra is enabled in the application settings.\r\n> \r\n> If you’re using AdGuard Browser Extension, we suggest installing AdGuard Extra in addition to it.\r\n> \r\n>     * [Install for Chrome, Edge or other Chromium-based browsers](https://agrd.io/adguard_extra_chrome_release)\r\n> \r\n>     * [Install for Firefox](https://agrd.io/adguard_extra_firefox_release)\r\n\r\nСпасибо,
