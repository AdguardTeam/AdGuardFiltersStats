A cookie consent banner is legally required, and is not an ad.\r\nHiding this banner can cripple the site in several ways:\r\n- As in our case, it did not hide the backdrop of the cookie banner\r\n- When applying the law to the letter, it is not allowed to place a cookie, unless the user approves it . This means, if the cookie banner is hidden, the website might miss basic features like login\n\n### Screenshots\n\n<details><summary>Screenshot 1:</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- paste screenshot here -->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/165246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/165246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-02T14:01:21Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
