YT works on my end with your settings.\n\nI am experiencing the exact same issue as another user described. When I disable the AdGuard Base Filter, the problem no longer occurs — but naturally, YouTube ads start showing again. I wanted to report this bug through the system, but I received the message: “This is a known problem,” and was unable to submit my report.\n\nI have tested this thoroughly and confirmed that the issue is caused by the AdGuard Base Filter. However, as expected, disabling the Base Filter allows YouTube ads to reappear.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n– Go to YouTube and click on any video in the homepage feed\n– Or open History and play any video\n– Or let one video finish and auto-play the next one\n\nIn all these cases, the video will freeze and refuse to load unless the browser’s reload button is manually clicked.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3116829294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-25T08:08:08Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

YT works on my end with your settings.\nI am experiencing the exact same issue as another user described. When I disable the AdGuard Base Filter, the problem no longer occurs — but naturally, YouTube ads start showing again. I wanted to report this bug through the system, but I received the message: “This is a known problem,” and was unable to submit my report.\nI have tested this thoroughly and confirmed that the issue is caused by the AdGuard Base Filter. However, as expected, disabling the Base Filter allows YouTube ads to reappear.\nSteps to reproduce:\n- Go to YouTube and click on any video in the homepage feed.\n- Or open History and play any video.\n- Or let one video finish and auto-play the next one.\nIn all these cases, the video will freeze and refuse to load unless the browser’s reload button is manually clicked.\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3116828019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-25T08:07:41Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript.
