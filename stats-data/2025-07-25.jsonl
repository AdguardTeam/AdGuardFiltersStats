YT works on my end with your settings.\n\nI am experiencing the exact same issue as another user described. When I disable the AdGuard Base Filter, the problem no longer occurs — but naturally, YouTube ads start showing again. I wanted to report this bug through the system, but I received the message: “This is a known problem,” and was unable to submit my report.\n\nI have tested this thoroughly and confirmed that the issue is caused by the AdGuard Base Filter. However, as expected, disabling the Base Filter allows YouTube ads to reappear.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n– Go to YouTube and click on any video in the homepage feed\n– Or open History and play any video\n– Or let one video finish and auto-play the next one\n\nIn all these cases, the video will freeze and refuse to load unless the browser’s reload button is manually clicked.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3116829294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-25T08:08:08Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

YT works on my end with your settings.\nI am experiencing the exact same issue as another user described. When I disable the AdGuard Base Filter, the problem no longer occurs — but naturally, YouTube ads start showing again. I wanted to report this bug through the system, but I received the message: “This is a known problem,” and was unable to submit my report.\nI have tested this thoroughly and confirmed that the issue is caused by the AdGuard Base Filter. However, as expected, disabling the Base Filter allows YouTube ads to reappear.\nSteps to reproduce:\n- Go to YouTube and click on any video in the homepage feed.\n- Or open History and play any video.\n- Or let one video finish and auto-play the next one.\nIn all these cases, the video will freeze and refuse to load unless the browser’s reload button is manually clicked.\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3116828019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-25T08:07:41Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
