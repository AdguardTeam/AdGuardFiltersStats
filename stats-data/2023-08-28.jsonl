Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-28T09:41:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

[#158937 (comment)](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158937#issuecomment-1695107117)\r\n> @bouscram What is the second problem? Page loads fine on my macbook.\r\n\r\nIf you're referring the 2nd screenshot, it's the normal view that the support wizard needs, not another problem.\r\n\r\nSome more explanations related to my issue: this is something I've seen for quite a while: the FB page loads slowly (only the first posts are usually shown at first, then others come but it can take several minutes, and sometimes nothing more is shown), and quite simultaneously, some text appear on the left (as shown in my 1st screenshot), from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nI don't know if there is a link, but this clearly happens less frequently on my (work) Macbook than on my (home) Mac mini with a large screen where it is almost all the time. I'll compare the Adguard settings tonight in case they are different. Maybe there is a link with the fact that on the large screen more posts (and potentially sponsored posts) are displayed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1695447953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-28T10:34:54Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

@Grandpat-Star\r\n> When I try to watch the official music video for Strawberry Wine by Deana Carter Official the adblock has not worked since last night. I have tried reloading and ads show up. When I have tried reloading other videos such as Introducing LEGO Braille Bricks – Play with Braille by Lego official, and the official audio for The Wrong Girl (Greatest Hits Version) by Lee Ann Womack Official the ads are not there. This seems to be contained to this specific video.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ghclp6szi9s0c8woscogs0w80og0ggsds7aguah22o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tfx68g4v7tw4wkkg0g0s44go0o88sc4dmcps04vezs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nOther extensions used: | Duck Duck Go Privacy Essentials, Return Youtube Disklike Button, Youtube-shorts block, CustomTube, and Replace Youtube's Home with Subscriptions","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1695847187","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932#issuecomment-1695847187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932","id":1695847187,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lFJMT","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-28T14:55:13Z","updated_at":"2023-08-28T14:55:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Alex-302 https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932#issuecomment-1695845268 Please take a look.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1695847187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-28T14:55:13Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Meerdere irritante reclames,  soms zelfs knipperend en verspringend images wat het zeer onrustig maakt om te kijken..

Zodra ik deze aanzet op deze site krijg ik de melding Adblocker gedetecteerd!  Pas na uitzetten werkt de site weer met alle irritatie vandien..

Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1696035929","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167#issuecomment-1696035929","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167","id":1696035929,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lF3RZ","user":{"login":"NUser2018","id":43743908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQzOTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43743908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018","html_url":"https://github.com/NUser2018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-28T17:00:30Z","updated_at":"2023-08-28T17:00:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Sergey-Lyapin Фикс уже вышел в релиз?

Раньше до недавнего времени от рекламы в этом приложении не было видно совсем ничего. На втором скриншоте рекламы нет, там нажимаешь кнопку продолжить для перехода на следующий уровень после чего при переходе между уровнями появляется реклама на весь экран (следы от неё показаны на третьем скриншоте) которую закрываешь крестиком в углу после чего переходщит на следующий уровень.

But when Adguard Tracking Protection filter is used, the paywall can not be unlocked. Adg tracking is breaking the functionality of Bypass Paywalls Clean filter.\r\n2. It seems this rule `nytimes.com#%#//scriptlet(\"set-constant\", \"Navigator.prototype.joinParakeetInterestGroup\", \"noopFunc\")` is the culprit. Creating an unblock/allow rule for this one makes the page show the full article. Please do something to make ADG tracking compatible with Bypass Paywall Clean filter in this case. \r\n\r\n3.

That's how it looks like with `Bypass Paywalls Clean filter` enabled:\r\n> \r\n> Screenshot\r\n> And with disabled `Bypass Paywalls Clean filter`:\r\n> \r\n> Screenshot\r\n> There were 2 similar rules which when used together caused a problem, but now I cannot reproduce it anymore.\r\n> \r\n> The mentioned rule:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> nytimes.com#%#//scriptlet(\"set-constant\", \"Navigator.prototype.joinParakeetInterestGroup\", \"noopFunc\")\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> is required for this issue - [#135303 (comment)](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/135303#issuecomment-1356927010), without it website is broken.\r\n> \r\n> If issue still occurs even after updating filters, then I recommend to add exception to user rules:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> nytimes.com#@%#//scriptlet(\"set-constant\", \"Navigator.prototype.joinParakeetInterestGroup\", \"noopFunc\")\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nI see. Can you try one more thing? For example, for me, after removing nytimes cookie from my browser if I visit the article reported in this issue above then the first time the full article is loaded most of the time. But then if I reload the page or go to nytimes home page and click on other articles on the home page then articles becomes locked again and \"Subscribe for $0.25/Week\" button appears beside the login button on top right. \r\nApart from your suggested exception rule, the only other thing that is working for me is this rule `nytimes.com##+js(cookie-remover, /^/)`\r\nBut of course, this rule can not be put into Adguard Base filter since it removes cookies every single time. \r\nIf you can not reproduce then I'll just keep using it by putting this in user rules.
