Появляется видео реклама после которой вылазит окно, которое приложил к обращению. Пытался сделать скриншот во время проигрыша рекламы.

Issue URL (Annoyance)\r\n [http://mangafire.to](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmangafire.to)\r\n### Comment\r\n> I ran into this issue last night and it turns out it redirects to another site every 6-hours, instead of 12-hours. I thought nothing much about it though, so I updated my filters to fix the issue, and I thought it worked but until this morning I found out it didn’t work at as the redirecting issue was still there.\r\n> \r\n> It turns out, the site redirects you if you click onto something like the pages or the ‘Contact Us’ (seen in the image) it redirects to a site similar to the site that you were on, and about 6-hours it doesn’t bother you until about 6-hours the redirect comes back.\r\n> \r\n> I thought this an issue that is already have been dealt with, thanks to the filters, but it turns out it may have missed these small few redirects. I’m not sure filter is meant for blocking redirects, but I’m certain that I have the most essential and necessary ones to prevent redirecting. Because I ran into issue before a few months on another site and by updating the filters solved the problem, but until now for some reason updating the filters didn’t work.\r\n> \r\n> So please do something about the redirects by updating the filters for blocking redirects or create a filter that is specifically designed to block redirects, because I’m not sure which one even says they will block redirects.\r\nUsername: `@Ian Chen`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/e245bcqgp5sgkoc40og0c0owc04wsojodmtjzzqxsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.4\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`, `default`, `(Regular)`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183155/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2249810244","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183155#issuecomment-2249810244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183155","id":2249810244,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86GGWFE","user":{"login":"IC3295","id":142564994,"node_id":"U_kgDOCH9egg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142564994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295","html_url":"https://github.com/IC3295","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-25T08:51:25Z","updated_at":"2024-07-25T08:51:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The issue returned as soon as I updated my filters.

updated my filters. I updated my filters, then went to watch an episode then as soon as I click onto it, it sends me to its manga counterpart.\r\n> \r\n> This problem is very similar to when MangaFire had the problem where every 6-hours a popunder will appear in one of the in-site buttons as soon as you click on it, will send you to another site every 6-hours. Will provide image for reference if you need to know what I’m talking about.\r\n> \r\n> So how this works (I think) is when you click on an episode to watch a popunder will appear and send you to its manga counterpart. This has been fixed before with MangaFire, so please fix this issue as well.\r\nUsername: `@Ian Chen`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4si1ketzxdogok8ccocc804o80gg4oklfs9hzcn58g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.5\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System default (Regular)`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2249782981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-25T08:38:21Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Примерно неделю-две назад начала появляться реклама в игре руммикуб в случае проигрыша партии. Появляется видео реклама после которой вылазит окно, которое приложил к обращению. Пытался сделать скриншот во время проигрыша рекламы.

Comment\r\n> Примерно неделю-две назад начала появляться реклама в игре руммикуб в случае проигрыша партии. Появляется видео реклама после которой вылазит окно, которое приложил к обращению. Пытался сделать скриншот во время проигрыша рекламы. Но при любой попытке что-либо нажать, сделать свайп - телефон переходит по ссылке на Гугл-плей рекламированной игры. Так что сделал только скриншот окна после рекламы.
