При чем на компьютере в ленте ВК нет рекламы , AdGuard работает отлично, видимо). А вот на смартфоне проскакивает. В ленте новостей 2-3,иногда 4 поста , потом реклама идёт , далее снова 3-4поста и снова реклама. Может что-то в настройках AdGuard сбилось после обновления или дополнительно надо что-то включить, чтобы не было таких рекламных постоа.Подскажите, пожалуйста))\r\nUsername: `@Татьяна `\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3v9b38rbfim8g48wosgokks8gww0ws0cvl95vfwr34.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/slxgxus30a8occkocc4ssc444ocskc0mgp5wyo8udc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.6.5\r\nSystem version: | Android 15\r\nBrowser: | Приложение \r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Dr. Web light","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196318/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-01-14T03:44:46Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n>  С недавних пор стала замечать, что на телефоне в приложении ВК (и в других соц сетях) стала появляться реклама. При чем на компьютере в ленте ВК нет рекламы , AdGuard работает отлично, видимо). А вот на смартфоне проскакивает. В ленте новостей 2-3,иногда 4 поста , потом реклама идёт , далее снова 3-4поста и снова реклама. Может что-то в настройках AdGuard сбилось после обновления или дополнительно надо что-то включить, чтобы не было таких рекламных постоа.Подскажите, пожалуйста))\r\nUsername: `@Татьяна `\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3v9b38rbfim8g48wosgokks8gww0ws0cvl95vfwr34.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/slxgxus30a8occkocc4ssc444ocskc0mgp5wyo8udc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.6.5\r\nSystem version: | Android 15\r\nBrowser: | Приложение \r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Dr. Web light","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196318/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2589276026","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196318#issuecomment-2589276026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196318","id":2589276026,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86aVTd6","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-14T08:15:12Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T08:15:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"К сожалению, в приложении ВК это не убрать, но можно открыть его в браузере.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2589276026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-01-14T08:15:14Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n>  С недавних пор стала замечать, что на телефоне в приложении ВК (и в других соц сетях) стала появляться реклама. При чем на компьютере в ленте ВК нет рекламы , AdGuard работает отлично, видимо). А вот на смартфоне проскакивает. В ленте новостей 2-3,иногда 4 поста , потом реклама идёт , далее снова 3-4поста и снова реклама. Может что-то в настройках AdGuard сбилось после обновления или дополнительно надо что-то включить, чтобы не было таких рекламных постоа.Подскажите, пожалуйста))\r\nUsername: `@Татьяна `\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3v9b38rbfim8g48wosgokks8gww0ws0cvl95vfwr34.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/slxgxus30a8occkocc4ssc444ocskc0mgp5wyo8udc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.6.5\r\nSystem version: | Android 15\r\nBrowser: | Приложение \r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Dr. Web light","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196318/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-01-14T08:15:13Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I don't have a screenshot or picture of it. But this behavior is across the board on all of my devices. I also have an Nvidia Shield and the Peacock app on my android phone. They all were blocking ads, and yesterday we noticed they are no longer blocking ads. \r\n2. I have updated all of my filters and the adguard version. This is currently running on a Raspberry Pi. No changes have been made to my network or devices. So not sure what would have caused the ads all of a sudden. \r\n\r\n3.
