But after going from one place to another in my country, it just came up with the ‘Safari can’t establish a secure connection’ error. Sure, I found a solution to the problem by using a VPN to help me access it, but however there is the strangest part, whenever I use the VPN for long-period of time, it causes some after-effect that causes the site itself to be accessible, despite it not accessible, for short-period of time (note, the VPN after-effect lasted for like 5 days). But for some reason, while I’m in another place that is not my home, I have this problem.\r\n> \r\n> As using the VPN helps, I always preferred to use the MangaFire site without the use of the VPN.\r\n> \r\n>  Is there a way to fix this issue by using the AdGuard filters, because I have tried everything else that would help me resolve this like: clearing-up cache, etc. but none of seem to do the trick.

But after going from one place to another in my country, it just came up with the ‘Safari can’t establish a secure connection’ error. Sure, I found a solution to the problem by using a VPN to help me access it, but however there is the strangest part, whenever I use the VPN for long-period of time, it causes some after-effect that causes the site itself to be accessible, despite it not accessible, for short-period of time (note, the VPN after-effect lasted for like 5 days). But for some reason, while I’m in another place that is not my home, I have this problem.\r\n> \r\n> As using the VPN helps, I always preferred to use the MangaFire site without the use of the VPN.\r\n> \r\n>  Is there a way to fix this issue by using the AdGuard filters, because I have tried everything else that would help me resolve this like: clearing-up cache, etc. but none of seem to do the trick. Are there any specific AdGuard filters or/and DNS server that I should have enabled so this will help fix the issue.\r\nUsername: `@Ian Chen`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/lbrgx6r0qi8oo4w0cos4k8og04wk0grsqe9jtb5ioo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/awvwoiheezkgcoowk0w0oggw8o4sw4sdoepqt2h9ao.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.1\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`, `default`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/167522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/167522/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1835385996","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/167522#issuecomment-1835385996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/167522","id":1835385996,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85tZcSM","user":{"login":"IC3295","id":142564994,"node_id":"U_kgDOCH9egg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142564994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295","html_url":"https://github.com/IC3295","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-01T03:11:25Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T03:11:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Oops, made a mistake in the DNS Filtering.

They can be found by:\r\n`document.cookie =`\r\nThey must be replaced by `set-cookie` / `set-cookie-reload` / `trusted-set-cookie-reload` scriptlet rules.\r\n\r\nThere are many old rules, so first you need to check if the site is available, and then the need for the rule.\r\n\r\n* For convenience, you can work in a separate browser\r\n* Retrieve the list of domains, clean up duplicates and check if sites exist (if redirects occur, we assume that the site is dead).\r\n* All such rules can be merged into one file, convert them to exception rules and import as custom filter.
