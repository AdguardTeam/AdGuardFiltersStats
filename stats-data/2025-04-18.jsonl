We understand the blocking appears to be related to the GitHub issue [#201710](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201710), concerning widget placement on nashaniva.com.\n\nAccording to your filter policy, we would like to present the following information for your consideration:\n\n1. Our widgets and links are content-enhancing tools that provide travel-related information and services within relevant editorial content. They are integrated into site content as elements of self-promotion and site-specific promotional activities. Each widget is added manually by the site owner, depending on the content of each page. There's no automatic or rotating ad system — placement is intentional and based on context. These are not external advertisements and don't match the criteria for blocking as described in your policy. The widgets provide useful search and price comparison functionality, offering additional value to readers of travel content, similar to how comments or chats extend page functionality.\n\n2. The specific implementation on nashaniva.com does not represent our standard guidelines for widget placement. It violates our own terms of service, as the widget was inserted outside of any travel-related content. According to our guidelines, widgets must be placed within meaningful editorial travel content to provide context and value to users.\n\n3. The current broad-spectrum blocking of our entire tp.media domain impacts thousands of legitimate travel bloggers and content creators who properly implement our widgets as part of their editorial content.\n\nWe request that you consider a more targeted approach by limiting any necessary blocking to the specific implementation on nashaniva.com rather than affecting our entire domain. This would align with your stated policy of minimizing false positives and avoiding over-blocking of legitimate content.\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/203466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/203466/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-18T12:32:52Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

As you may know, the web version of Spotify starts playing ads after a few songs. Until recently, your extension was effectively removing the ads, ensuring no interruptions between songs.

Comment\r\n> Hi, thanks for your great extension! As you may know, the web version of Spotify starts playing ads after a few songs. Until recently, your extension was effectively removing the ads, ensuring no interruptions between songs. However, lately, even when the extension is active, Spotify still enters ad-play mode. No ads are actually played, but the website seems to freeze, and I have to refresh the page.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qt5i1iuw4m8k4kog40ggcc0o04oo88c4xt1dou0hnc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hbg2v3j6vt44gswk8c8wgs00s08s488iemg62367fs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/f2i98xwe8mgo4k4o008kg0wsococw04ekdu2nzm08g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/7of16fg8lt0k4osg80k440k8kkg8gkom8tt6c2hd00.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.0.219 MV3\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (0)<br><br>**Browser API**:<br>Block WebRTC<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Persian Blocker\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2815656883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-18T15:34:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
