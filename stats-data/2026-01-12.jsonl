website is working fine, but there is a huge empty div between the top menu bar and the website context (you have to scroll down a lot). With Adguard disabled, the problematic ad takes only a little height, not that much. It is easily fixable by using a user rule, but I thought it might be a good idea to fix it \"globally\", for every user.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @gleniu87\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/o9stdtuj95c8wog4wcg8084kswg4404eg7e02vkvrc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.22.3 (5240)\r\nSystem version: | `Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.19045.0`\r\nBrowser: | Opera\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`, `User rules (url: none)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>Polish GDPR-Cookies Filters, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>Polish Annoyances Filters, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>EasyList Polish, <br/>Polish Anti-Annoying Special Supplement, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Serbo-Croatian List</details>\r\nCustom filters: | `User rules (url: none)`\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | `AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)`<br>`AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)`\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=win&product_version=7.22.3+%285240%29&system_version=Microsoft+Windows+NT+10.0.19045.0&browser=opera&filters=1.2.3.6.11.13.16.18.19.20.21.105.108.109.112.203.207.216.217.227.233.235.237.238.243.246.247.249.251.252&custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%253A%2520none%29&dns_servers=System&userscripts=AdGuard%2520Extra%2520%28url%253A%2520https%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fadguard-extra%252F1.0%252Fadguard-extra.user.js%29%252C%250AAdGuard%2520Popup%2520Blocker%2520%28url%253A%2520https%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fpopup-blocker%252F2.5%252Fpopupblocker.user.js%29&dns.filters=AdGuard%2520DNS%2520Filter%252C%250AUser%2520rules%2520%28url%253A%2520none%29&dns.filters_enabled=true&dns.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false&stealth.webrtc=false&stealth.push=false&stealth.location=true&stealth.flash=false&stealth.java=false&stealth.strip_url=false&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.x_client=true&stealth.dpi=false&stealth.third_party_cookies=180&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=false&stealth.block_third_party_auth=false&stealth.block_trackers=true&stealth.disable_wap_push_message_routing_service=false&stealth.disable_windows_defender=false&stealth.disable_windows_telemetry=true&stealth.turn_off_advertising_id=true&win.wfp=true&license_type=paid&scheme_version=2&adblocking.enabled=true&dns.timeout=0&dns.fallback_mode=System&stealth.disable_windows_recall=true)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/222351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/222351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2026-01-12T06:45:41Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> With AdGuard annoyances filters enabled the banner that reads \"Continue reading with a Verge subscription\" is hidden but the grey overlay is not. Scrolling is also blocked. This creates some initial confusion around why the page seems inaccessible, until disabling the ad blocker reveals that the page is behind a paywall. I don't expect nor want AdGuard to bypass paywalls, but whitelisting whatever element creates the banner so users can see it would eliminate the confusion without compromising the browsing experience.\r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/8qaccaykzyo8wss44o0ckoswwgsg8w05vjwygzpy48.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Mini for Mac v2.0.4.942\r\nSystem version: | `MacOS 15.7.3 (Build 24G419)`\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets\r\nFilters last update: | January 12, 2026 at 09:39","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3737683606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2026-01-12T09:47:36Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
