Здравствуйте! Используя меню \"Блокировать рекламу на этом сайте\", скрываю 2 рекламных блока, отмеченных на скриншоте. Но ровно на следующий день реклама возвращается. Блокировал оба блока каждый день на протяжении нескольких месяцев, но что-то надоело этим заниматься и возник закономерный вопрос: почему такое происходит? Интересно с технической точки зрения. Предполагаю, что Яндекс таким образом борется с подобным ПО, но неужели вы не в силах блокировать вышеуказанную рекламу на постоянной основе?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/e0CGKDE.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | Yandex\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard German","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141393/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-01-31T07:43:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Здравствуйте! Используя меню \"Блокировать рекламу на этом сайте\", скрываю 2 рекламных блока, отмеченных на скриншоте. Но ровно на следующий день реклама возвращается. Блокировал оба блока каждый день на протяжении нескольких месяцев, но что-то надоело этим заниматься и возник закономерный вопрос: почему такое происходит? Интересно с технической точки зрения. Предполагаю, что Яндекс таким образом борется с подобным ПО, но неужели вы не в силах блокировать вышеуказанную рекламу на постоянной основе?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/e0CGKDE.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | Yandex\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard German","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141393/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1409904685","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141393#issuecomment-1409904685","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141393","id":1409904685,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85UCXAt","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-31T07:43:04Z","updated_at":"2023-01-31T07:43:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141393#issuecomment-1409898717 установите AdGuard Extra.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis issue is known to be solved with [AdGuard Extra](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardExtra) userscript.\r\n\r\nIf you’re using AdGuard Browser Extension, we suggest installing AdGuard Extra in addition to it.\r\n\r\n* [Install for Chrome, Edge or other Chromium-based browsers](https://agrd.io/adguard_extra_chrome_release)\r\n* [Install for Firefox](https://agrd.io/adguard_extra_firefox_release)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1409904685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-01-31T07:43:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Здравствуйте! Используя меню \"Блокировать рекламу на этом сайте\", скрываю 2 рекламных блока, отмеченных на скриншоте. Но ровно на следующий день реклама возвращается. Блокировал оба блока каждый день на протяжении нескольких месяцев, но что-то надоело этим заниматься и возник закономерный вопрос: почему такое происходит? Интересно с технической точки зрения. Предполагаю, что Яндекс таким образом борется с подобным ПО, но неужели вы не в силах блокировать вышеуказанную рекламу на постоянной основе?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/e0CGKDE.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | Yandex\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard German","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141393/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1409898717","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141393#issuecomment-1409898717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141393","id":1409898717,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85UCVjd","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-31T07:36:19Z","updated_at":"2023-01-31T07:36:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [https://mail.yandex.ru/?uid=397545339#inbox](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.yandex.ru%2F%3Fuid%3D397545339%23inbox)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/lSrMBIZ.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | Opera\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1409898717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-01-31T07:36:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Здравствуйте! Используя меню \"Блокировать рекламу на этом сайте\", скрываю 2 рекламных блока, отмеченных на скриншоте. Но ровно на следующий день реклама возвращается. Блокировал оба блока каждый день на протяжении нескольких месяцев, но что-то надоело этим заниматься и возник закономерный вопрос: почему такое происходит? Интересно с технической точки зрения. Предполагаю, что Яндекс таким образом борется с подобным ПО, но неужели вы не в силах блокировать вышеуказанную рекламу на постоянной основе?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/e0CGKDE.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | Yandex\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard German","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141393/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-01-31T07:36:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
