@AdamWr sorry to bother you. I hope I'm in the right place to ask, there has been some discussion around that issue (you can read more https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/27884 and on some relevant subreddits). The filtering you applied is a bit too aggressive since it apparently also targets autopromotion (links that redirects to the website itself) with no tracking or any commercial stuff.\n\nThere has been a major support of those \"user ads\" by the RoyalRoad community, and a middle ground was found with uBO to be a bit more precise in the filtering. I'm sharing here so there is parity with the adblockers and everyone can be satisfied (users of RR and of adblockers)\n\nWe found a working (a bit too aggressive, but still largely better) solution with the following filter :\n\n```adb\nroyalroad.com##.dKKumhSnWiFq75vPUVtmTanQ:has(a[href^=\"https://www.royalroad.com/a/r?campaign=\"]:not([href*=\"&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.royalroad.com\"]))\n```\n\nThis will catch any link that redirects to a website that is not RoayRoal.\n\nThank you for reading this message, and thank you for your work, I know it's not easy.\n\nHave a nice day / evening :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2795287586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-10T22:18:26Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
