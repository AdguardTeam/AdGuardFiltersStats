'{\"ru_sng\":{\"status\":\"agree\",\"ts\":1893445200,\"v\":2},\"uae\":{\"status\":\"agree\",\"ts\":1893445200,\"v\":2}}')\n```\n\nПравило будет работать как для СНГ доменов (https://2gis.ru, https://2gis.kz, https://2gis.az и т. д.), так и для ОАЭ https://2gis.ae.\n\nНу и в качестве даты я сделал 2030 год. Хотел использовать `$now$`, но видимо его нельзя использовать внутри строки.\n\nНу и для 2gis.ae по-хорошему бы использовать `trusted-set-cookie-reload`, так как там только после перезагрузки страницы срабатывает правило, но не уверен, стоит ли оно того ради одного домена.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2872735118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-12T14:10:01Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

ага, ваши правила работают. А зачем экранировать символы?\n\nНу и я проверял на декстопе с открытыми девтулзами, и почти на всех доменах срабатывает выражение `debugger`. И видимо, при нажатии продолжить, страница сама перезагружалась, поэтому я и думал, что не нужно использовать `trusted-set-cookie-reload`. Но при проверке на iOS устройстве, на всех доменах нужна перезагрузка после установки кук.\n\nА вы какое-то приложение используете для отслеживания изменения кук/локального хранилища? А то в девтулзах обычно проще всего перед действием очистить куки/локальное хранилище и затем смотреть, что изменилось после нажатия на сайте. Но иногда при удалении кук сайт сразу разлогинивает, и тогда вообще не понятно, как отслеживать изменения.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2873625688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-12T18:38:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
