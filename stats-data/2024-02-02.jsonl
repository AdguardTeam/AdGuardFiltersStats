( [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing#264](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing/issues/264) )\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n> Please check that there no another web browser extension that has adblocking feature is enabled on your web browser. It can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \r\n> Saving memory feature of your web browser or sleep feature of your operating system can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n> In this case, please re-enable AdGuard's filtering by toggling the protection toggle.\r\n> Following the instructions can be needed.\r\n\r\n### The instructions\r\n1. Force to update the filters by clicking the reload button in AdGuard Browser Extension/AdGuard mobile or update tray menu in your system tray. [^2]\r\n2. Reload the YouTube webpage without cache by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> [^3].\r\n3. Clear cache, cookies and site data of your web browser.\r\n4.

I think it happens on several domains (also on Android) but here I can only show on Windows 10 for \"mydealz.de\" that requests \"faye.prod-eks.pepper.com\" (some kind of tracking). As you can see it is requested every few seconds, most of the requests are blocked, but it seems that every 4th request is answered from the cache and returns a domain. But I am not totally sure that the requests succeed, because in the network tab of the dev tools of vivaldi, all the requests seem to fail.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4hlrcy23v6ass0cwswgwwokgcww4s44he4fc2wk1bk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.16.0 (4542) (CL 1.13.115, DL 2.4.37 )\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 19045\r\nBrowser: | Vivaldi\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Block trackers, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Cloudflare`, `DNS`<br>filters: `||faye.prod-eks.pepper.com^`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List\r\nUserscripts: | Adguard Assistant<br> Extra<br> Popup Blocker\r\nWeb of trust","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172018/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-02T09:45:33Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

request are done several times. I think it happens on several domains (also on Android) but here I can only show on Windows 10 for \"mydealz.de\" that requests \"faye.prod-eks.pepper.com\" (some kind of tracking). As you can see it is requested every few seconds, most of the requests are blocked, but it seems that every 4th request is answered from the cache and returns a domain. But I am not totally sure that the requests succeed, because in the network tab of the dev tools of vivaldi, all the requests seem to fail.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4hlrcy23v6ass0cwswgwwokgcww4s44he4fc2wk1bk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.16.0 (4542) (CL 1.13.115, DL 2.4.37 )\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 19045\r\nBrowser: | Vivaldi\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Block trackers, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Cloudflare`, `DNS`<br>filters: `||faye.prod-eks.pepper.com^`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List\r\nUserscripts: | Adguard Assistant<br> Extra<br> Popup Blocker\r\nWeb of trust","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172018/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1923545722","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172018#issuecomment-1923545722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172018","id":1923545722,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85ypvp6","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-02T10:45:02Z","updated_at":"2024-02-02T10:45:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If you still have it, it's best to ask about it [here](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1923545722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-02T10:45:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

request are done several times. I think it happens on several domains (also on Android) but here I can only show on Windows 10 for \"mydealz.de\" that requests \"faye.prod-eks.pepper.com\" (some kind of tracking). As you can see it is requested every few seconds, most of the requests are blocked, but it seems that every 4th request is answered from the cache and returns a domain. But I am not totally sure that the requests succeed, because in the network tab of the dev tools of vivaldi, all the requests seem to fail.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4hlrcy23v6ass0cwswgwwokgcww4s44he4fc2wk1bk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.16.0 (4542) (CL 1.13.115, DL 2.4.37 )\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 19045\r\nBrowser: | Vivaldi\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Block trackers, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Cloudflare`, `DNS`<br>filters: `||faye.prod-eks.pepper.com^`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List\r\nUserscripts: | Adguard Assistant<br> Extra<br> Popup Blocker\r\nWeb of trust","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172018/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-02T10:45:03Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I think it happens on several domains (also on Android) but here I can only show on Windows 10 for \"mydealz.de\" that requests \"faye.prod-eks.pepper.com\" (some kind of tracking). As you can see it is requested every few seconds, most of the requests are blocked, but it seems that every 4th request is answered from the cache and returns a domain. But I am not totally sure that the requests succeed, because in the network tab of the dev tools of vivaldi, all the requests seem to fail.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4hlrcy23v6ass0cwswgwwokgcww4s44he4fc2wk1bk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.16.0 (4542) (CL 1.13.115, DL 2.4.37 )\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 19045\r\nBrowser: | Vivaldi\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Block trackers, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Cloudflare`, `DNS`<br>filters: `||faye.prod-eks.pepper.com^`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List\r\nUserscripts: | Adguard Assistant<br> Extra<br> Popup Blocker\r\nWeb of trust","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172018/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1923586471","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172018#issuecomment-1923586471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172018","id":1923586471,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85yp5mn","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-02T11:09:20Z","updated_at":"2024-02-02T11:09:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \"faye.prod-eks.pepper.com\" (some kind of tracking)\r\n\r\nAbout this.

Endesa Clientes tarda mucho en cargar y cuando accede, hace destellos quedándose en blanco durante más de 5 segundos. El bloqueador de AdGuard debe estar realizando algún tipo de bloqueo en el acceso porque si se deshabilita por completo no hace este problema, pero si se deja la app y aun desactivando la función de filtrado en este sitio web, sigue funcionando incorrectamente. Quiero creer que es por el DNS, pero quiero saber cómo configurarlo correctamente.

Endesa Clientes tarda mucho en cargar y cuando accede, hace destellos quedándose en blanco durante más de 5 segundos. El bloqueador de AdGuard debe estar realizando algún tipo de bloqueo en el acceso porque si se deshabilita por completo no hace este problema, pero si se deja la app y aun desactivando la función de filtrado en este sitio web, sigue funcionando incorrectamente.
