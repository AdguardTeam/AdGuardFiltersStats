If you just disable the filter (which doesn't come enabled by default in uBO but it's a standard filter) and refresh the page, the download links then show up.\r\n> \r\n> I use that website almost daily, and the issue appeared suddenly, starting in December 07, this Thursday. It was working fine with the AdGuard - Ads filter just the day before. Of course I first attempted to purge all caches in uBO, update lists and then update the extension, but that didn't work. Resetting the extension to default settings fixed the issue, and further tests and investigation showed that the problem was related to this filter.\r\n> \r\n> The problem can be easily reproduced and happens with all browsers I've tested (tried Vivaldi, Chrome, ungoogled Chromium and Firefox, in my main machine, and also fresh installs of Chromium and Firefox with freshly installed uBO in a VM)\r\n> \r\n> More info and details:\r\n> https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/18d9pre/multiuporg_detecting_ubo_and_demanding_whitelist/\r\n> \r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/e7aud5jd7eo0gow80wgckgs4ggwcoo0kc6toqqn7og.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bvhs71pthk0g0k8o8w44k44gkwcg4codjetz2ck07w.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | uBlock Origin\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 1903\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist\r\nOther extensions used: | Stylus, Nimbus Screenshot","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/168079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/168079/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-08T18:31:57Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://multiup.io](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmultiup.io)\r\n### Comment\r\n> In the multiup.io website, download links don't show up when the \"AdGuard - Ads\" filter is enabled in a fresh, default, uBlock Origin 1.54.0 install. If you just disable the filter (which doesn't come enabled by default in uBO but it's a standard filter) and refresh the page, the download links then show up.\r\n> \r\n> I use that website almost daily, and the issue appeared suddenly, starting in December 07, this Thursday. It was working fine with the AdGuard - Ads filter just the day before. Of course I first attempted to purge all caches in uBO, update lists and then update the extension, but that didn't work. Resetting the extension to default settings fixed the issue, and further tests and investigation showed that the problem was related to this filter.\r\n> \r\n> The problem can be easily reproduced and happens with all browsers I've tested (tried Vivaldi, Chrome, ungoogled Chromium and Firefox, in my main machine, and also fresh installs of Chromium and Firefox with freshly installed uBO in a VM)\r\n> \r\n> More info and details:\r\n> https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/18d9pre/multiuporg_detecting_ubo_and_demanding_whitelist/\r\n> \r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/e7aud5jd7eo0gow80wgckgs4ggwcoo0kc6toqqn7og.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bvhs71pthk0g0k8o8w44k44gkwcg4codjetz2ck07w.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | uBlock Origin\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 1903\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist\r\nOther extensions used: | Stylus, Nimbus Screenshot","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/168079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/168079/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1847695607","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/168079#issuecomment-1847695607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/168079","id":1847695607,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85uIZj3","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-08T19:18:56Z","updated_at":"2023-12-08T19:18:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Fixed, filters update should be available in 1-2 hours.\r\nPlease next time provide direct link where issue occurs (I tested it on the link from this issue - https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160963).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1847695607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-08T19:18:57Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://multiup.io](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmultiup.io)\r\n### Comment\r\n> In the multiup.io website, download links don't show up when the \"AdGuard - Ads\" filter is enabled in a fresh, default, uBlock Origin 1.54.0 install. If you just disable the filter (which doesn't come enabled by default in uBO but it's a standard filter) and refresh the page, the download links then show up.\r\n> \r\n> I use that website almost daily, and the issue appeared suddenly, starting in December 07, this Thursday. It was working fine with the AdGuard - Ads filter just the day before. Of course I first attempted to purge all caches in uBO, update lists and then update the extension, but that didn't work. Resetting the extension to default settings fixed the issue, and further tests and investigation showed that the problem was related to this filter.\r\n> \r\n> The problem can be easily reproduced and happens with all browsers I've tested (tried Vivaldi, Chrome, ungoogled Chromium and Firefox, in my main machine, and also fresh installs of Chromium and Firefox with freshly installed uBO in a VM)\r\n> \r\n> More info and details:\r\n> https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/18d9pre/multiuporg_detecting_ubo_and_demanding_whitelist/\r\n> \r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/e7aud5jd7eo0gow80wgckgs4ggwcoo0kc6toqqn7og.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bvhs71pthk0g0k8o8w44k44gkwcg4codjetz2ck07w.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | uBlock Origin\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 1903\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist\r\nOther extensions used: | Stylus, Nimbus Screenshot","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/168079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/168079/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-08T19:16:49Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
