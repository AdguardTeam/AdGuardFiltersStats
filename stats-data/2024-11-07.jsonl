I encounter this somewhat often (regularly enough to be an annoyance). I remember a non-sponsored site also not working another time due to in-between tracking URLs, but I don't recall which page so have no proof of it ever happening.\r\n> \r\n> In my opinion, if an ad (or sponsored search result, which I have enabled in my AdGuard settings) shows up it should also work. The g2a website itself is not blocked, it is just one or more tracking pages in between that are. \r\nUsername: `@Hedge4`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ke9aljl765cksks8so4wcws8oc4gwswq35ymae6ni8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/eno7c2xk81kw44goosgoc4kggc0ogokoxzhopng0kg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ge58h2crtjww0k4sskocow8ckc8wos05nx0uwdi6tk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.19.0 (4853)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.22631.0\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`, `User DNS filter (url: none)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Dutch\r\nCustom filters: | User filter (url: none)\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js)<br>AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.google.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | Irrelevant.

They can be found by:\r\n`document.cookie =`\r\nThey must be replaced by `set-cookie` / `set-cookie-reload` / `trusted-set-cookie-reload` scriptlet rules.\r\n\r\nThere are many old rules, so first you need to check if the site is available, and then the need for the rule.\r\n\r\n* For convenience, you can work in a separate browser\r\n* Retrieve the list of domains, clean up duplicates and check if sites exist (if redirects occur, we assume that the site is dead).\r\n* All such rules can be merged into one file, convert them to exception rules and import as custom filter. Then go down the list and check if the rules are needed (other types of problems not related to these rules are skipped).\r\n* If the site is dead - add domains in the comment below. Then we will remove them from the filters.\r\n\r\nIn order not to overlap with other filter maintainers, it is desirable to perform batch rule replacement via pull-requests (5-10 rules per PR).\r\n\r\n### Important\r\nIt should be checked with a Dutch or German VPN, because otherwise the cookie usage messages may not appear.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166756/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-07T06:35:00Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> AdGuard (I assume DNS filtering) breaks this sponsored Google search result. I encounter this somewhat often (regularly enough to be an annoyance). I remember a non-sponsored site also not working another time due to in-between tracking URLs, but I don't recall which page so have no proof of it ever happening.\r\n> \r\n> In my opinion, if an ad (or sponsored search result, which I have enabled in my AdGuard settings) shows up it should also work. The g2a website itself is not blocked, it is just one or more tracking pages in between that are. \r\nUsername: `@Hedge4`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ke9aljl765cksks8so4wcws8oc4gwswq35ymae6ni8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/eno7c2xk81kw44goosgoc4kggc0ogokoxzhopng0kg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ge58h2crtjww0k4sskocow8ckc8wos05nx0uwdi6tk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.19.0 (4853)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.22631.0\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`, `User DNS filter (url: none)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Dutch\r\nCustom filters: | User filter (url: none)\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js)<br>AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.google.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | Irrelevant.

I encounter this somewhat often (regularly enough to be an annoyance). I remember a non-sponsored site also not working another time due to in-between tracking URLs, but I don't recall which page so have no proof of it ever happening.\r\n> \r\n> In my opinion, if an ad (or sponsored search result, which I have enabled in my AdGuard settings) shows up it should also work. The g2a website itself is not blocked, it is just one or more tracking pages in between that are. \r\nUsername: `@Hedge4`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ke9aljl765cksks8so4wcws8oc4gwswq35ymae6ni8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/eno7c2xk81kw44goosgoc4kggc0ogokoxzhopng0kg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ge58h2crtjww0k4sskocow8ckc8wos05nx0uwdi6tk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.19.0 (4853)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.22631.0\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`, `User DNS filter (url: none)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Dutch\r\nCustom filters: | User filter (url: none)\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js)<br>AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.google.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | Irrelevant.
