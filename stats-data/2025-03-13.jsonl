screenshots\n\n你好，我提的这个issue其实与广告无关，但还是想着尝试提一下。在中国很多公司为了节省网络费用，因此就在软件中默认启用pcdn等技术，以此来降低费用，但是中国的网络运营商打击pcdn，有一些用户因为软件的pcdn上传了太多流量，比如一天内上传了几TB，然后导致宽带被限速或者封禁。于是我收集了很多pcdn域名，希望能够添加到Adguard DNS过滤器中，这个pcdn很恶心，影响到不少人了。下面的部分域名出现在上面下载链接对应的软件\n\nws-p2p.pull.yximgs.com^

DNS过滤器\nta.pinduoduo.com\nth.pinduoduo.com\n下面三条规则建议添加到Adguard防跟踪过滤器，你们再看一下图，图中的url是软件为了绕过规则，所以使用IP，我就用这三条规则拦截，目前软件没有异常。url内容中可以看出会上传版本号等等信息，这侵犯隐私，我觉得应该禁止。为了避免以后IP更改导致规则失效，规则应该不包含IP。\n||*d4?appid*type*\n||*/d?id=*type*\n||*/d?dn=*&id*&type=*\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daf635be-04c5-4e31-b231-f2f0b5e6e061)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25762a81-5f43-4527-87f4-45204f05dccb)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9243ab92-d73e-4f77-8fe7-42e26c99d8cc)\n\n###
