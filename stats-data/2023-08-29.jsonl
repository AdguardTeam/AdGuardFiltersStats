Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697016537","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167#issuecomment-1697016537","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167","id":1697016537,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lJmrZ","user":{"login":"NUser2018","id":43743908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQzOTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43743908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018","html_url":"https://github.com/NUser2018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-29T08:41:44Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T08:41:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Долню ещё что раньше шага\\экрана с рекламой при переходе между уровнями не было видно совсем т.к. он успешно блокировался Adguard, т.е. при нажатии кнопки продолжить как на втором скриншоте сразу открывался следующий уровень.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697016537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-29T08:41:44Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо.

Дополню что реклама\\след от рекламы при прохождении уровней внизу появляется далеко не сразу после открытия\\запуска игрового уровня, поэтому при проверках лучше подождать не менее 1 минуты, лучше больше для надёжности до 1,5 минут (например у меня реклама\\след от рекламы внизу при прохождении уровней появляется в интервале от 1:05 до 1:15 после открытия\\запуска уровня).

Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697122442","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167#issuecomment-1697122442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167","id":1697122442,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lKAiK","user":{"login":"Sergey-Lyapin","id":18536328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM2MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18536328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin","html_url":"https://github.com/Sergey-Lyapin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-29T09:52:24Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T09:52:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Здравствуйте, @NUser2018 \r\nОчистите, пожалуйста, кэш приложения и проверьте снова.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697122442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-29T09:52:25Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

you use?\n\nAdGuard Browser Extension\n\n### AdGuard version\n\n4.2.151\n\n### What type of problem have you encountered?\n\nWebsite or app doesn't work properly\n\n### Which browser(s) do you use?\n\nChrome\n\n### Which device do you use?\n\nDesktop\n\n### Where is the problem encountered?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/26/business/economy/us-economy-china.html\n\n### What filters do you have enabled?\n\nAdGuard Base filter, AdGuard Tracking Protection filter, AdGuard URL Tracking filter, AdGuard Social Media filter, AdGuard Annoyances filter, Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List\n\n### What Stealth Mode options do you have enabled?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add your comment and screenshots\n\n1. <comment>I also use \"Bypass Paywalls Clean filter\". But when Adguard Tracking Protection filter is used, the paywall can not be unlocked. Adg tracking is breaking the functionality of Bypass Paywalls Clean filter.\r\n2. It seems this rule `nytimes.com#%#//scriptlet(\"set-constant\", \"Navigator.prototype.joinParakeetInterestGroup\", \"noopFunc\")` is the culprit. Creating an unblock/allow rule for this one makes the page show the full article. Please do something to make ADG tracking compatible with Bypass Paywall Clean filter in this case. \r\n\r\n3.
