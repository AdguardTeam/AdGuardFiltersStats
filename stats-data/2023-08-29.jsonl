Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697016537","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167#issuecomment-1697016537","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167","id":1697016537,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lJmrZ","user":{"login":"NUser2018","id":43743908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQzOTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43743908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018","html_url":"https://github.com/NUser2018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-29T08:41:44Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T08:41:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Долню ещё что раньше шага\\экрана с рекламой при переходе между уровнями не было видно совсем т.к. он успешно блокировался Adguard, т.е. при нажатии кнопки продолжить как на втором скриншоте сразу открывался следующий уровень.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697016537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-29T08:41:44Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо.

Дополню что реклама\\след от рекламы при прохождении уровней внизу появляется далеко не сразу после открытия\\запуска игрового уровня, поэтому при проверках лучше подождать не менее 1 минуты, лучше больше для надёжности до 1,5 минут (например у меня реклама\\след от рекламы внизу при прохождении уровней появляется в интервале от 1:05 до 1:15 после открытия\\запуска уровня).

Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697122442","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167#issuecomment-1697122442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167","id":1697122442,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lKAiK","user":{"login":"Sergey-Lyapin","id":18536328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM2MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18536328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin","html_url":"https://github.com/Sergey-Lyapin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-29T09:52:24Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T09:52:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Здравствуйте, @NUser2018 \r\nОчистите, пожалуйста, кэш приложения и проверьте снова.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697122442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-29T09:52:25Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

you use?\n\nAdGuard Browser Extension\n\n### AdGuard version\n\n4.2.151\n\n### What type of problem have you encountered?\n\nWebsite or app doesn't work properly\n\n### Which browser(s) do you use?\n\nChrome\n\n### Which device do you use?\n\nDesktop\n\n### Where is the problem encountered?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/26/business/economy/us-economy-china.html\n\n### What filters do you have enabled?\n\nAdGuard Base filter, AdGuard Tracking Protection filter, AdGuard URL Tracking filter, AdGuard Social Media filter, AdGuard Annoyances filter, Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List\n\n### What Stealth Mode options do you have enabled?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add your comment and screenshots\n\n1. <comment>I also use \"Bypass Paywalls Clean filter\". But when Adguard Tracking Protection filter is used, the paywall can not be unlocked. Adg tracking is breaking the functionality of Bypass Paywalls Clean filter.\r\n2. It seems this rule `nytimes.com#%#//scriptlet(\"set-constant\", \"Navigator.prototype.joinParakeetInterestGroup\", \"noopFunc\")` is the culprit. Creating an unblock/allow rule for this one makes the page show the full article. Please do something to make ADG tracking compatible with Bypass Paywall Clean filter in this case. \r\n\r\n3.

Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697237766","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167#issuecomment-1697237766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167","id":1697237766,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lKcsG","user":{"login":"NUser2018","id":43743908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQzOTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43743908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018","html_url":"https://github.com/NUser2018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-29T11:10:43Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T11:10:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Sergey-Lyapin Верните пожалуйста этой задаче статус открыто, поскольку пока проблема не решена ещё.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697237766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-29T11:10:43Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697230473","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167#issuecomment-1697230473","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167","id":1697230473,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lKa6J","user":{"login":"NUser2018","id":43743908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQzOTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43743908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018","html_url":"https://github.com/NUser2018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-29T11:05:12Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T11:05:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Sergey-Lyapin Кэш приложения игры? Я об этом сразу подумал и пробовал уже. Но сейчас специально прповерил ещё раз. Обновил снова фильтры в AdGuard вручную принудительно, очистил кэш приложения игры и проверил снова. К сожалению проблема сохраняется. Учитывая что реклама от Яндекса известна своей хитростью и агрессивностью, то может быть недостаточно внесения фикса только в обычные фильтры а нужно внести ещё какой-то фикс в скрипт\\расширение Adguard Extra? Или Adguard Extra влияет\\применяется только для браузера но не для всх других приложений? Жду Вашего следующего ответа.

Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697336643","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167#issuecomment-1697336643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167","id":1697336643,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lK01D","user":{"login":"Sergey-Lyapin","id":18536328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM2MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18536328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin","html_url":"https://github.com/Sergey-Lyapin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-29T12:20:25Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T12:20:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"У меня реклама блокируется полностью","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697336643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-29T12:20:26Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697307781","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167#issuecomment-1697307781","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167","id":1697307781,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lKtyF","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-29T12:02:02Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T12:02:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@NUser2018 Остановите приложение, очистите кэш, очистите журнал фильтрации и повторите проблему.

Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-29T11:49:54Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard.

Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697540442","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167#issuecomment-1697540442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167","id":1697540442,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lLmla","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-29T14:19:27Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T14:19:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Всё, вижу. @Sergey-Lyapin второе правило с яндексным IP тоже нужно.

Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697524270","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167#issuecomment-1697524270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167","id":1697524270,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lLiou","user":{"login":"NUser2018","id":43743908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQzOTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43743908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018","html_url":"https://github.com/NUser2018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-29T14:12:22Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T14:12:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Sergey-Lyapin и @Alex-302\r\n\r\n> Потом сделайте скринов журнала\r\n\r\nСделал.

Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо.

Comment\r\nUsername: @NUser2018\r\n> Перестала блокироватся реклама в приложении игры \"Филворды\" (игра от разработчика Lunapp по поиску слов на полях из букв) (ссылка на это приложение в Google Play была предоставлена на одном из предыдущих шагов при заполнении формы репорта о пропущенной рекламе). Реклама на уровнях во время прохождения уровней внизу и при переходах между уровнями на следующий уровень. Скриншоты прилагаются. Реклама разная и меняется. Сам пока не встречал, но судя по отзывам пользователей в Google Play бывает даже реклама со звуком. До этого времени AdGuard успешно блокировал всю рекламу в этом приложении, теперь реклама в этом приложении появилась и у меня. Реклама мешает, но игра очень хорошая и интересная, надеюсь команда AdGuard сможет побыстрее пофиксить и снова заблокировать рекламу в этом приложении. Пользуюсь платной версией AdGuard. Заранее спасибо. С уважением Александр.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8m27fxogrpk44sgo80wg448cw0kw400fpphkjryq8o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b7n7fzomohwgkc48gsw48cw4cg080swh5ivzot7u3k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697640027","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167#issuecomment-1697640027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/160167","id":1697640027,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lL-5b","user":{"login":"NUser2018","id":43743908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQzOTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43743908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018","html_url":"https://github.com/NUser2018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-29T15:12:16Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T15:12:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Alex-302 и @Sergey-Lyapin Судя по тому что я вижу по ссылке на файл мобильного фильтра из приложения на смартфоне новые фиксы уже вошли в него в релиз?\r\n\r\nТогда вынужден сообщить что (после обновления фильтров AdGuard вручную) проблема сохраняется, след от рекламы при прохождении уровня внизу всё-равно появляется и ещё быстрее теперь, секунд через 30-40 после запуска уровня.\r\n\r\nПро рекламу между уровнями не знаю пока, сейчас постараюсь проверить и написать сюда снова.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1697640027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-29T15:12:16Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
