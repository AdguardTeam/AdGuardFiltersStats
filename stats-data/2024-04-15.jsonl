so what do you suggest then in order to be able to access certain web domains like **ad.doubleclick.net**?  Any Google ad that uses this site/service is blocked, and thus prevents being able to access the link.  I don't want to remove AdGuard DNS servers just to be able to occasionally load this one domain.  I'm not sure why you'd want to block it though, considering that so many Google ads rely on this to load their product links.\r\n\r\nOk, I assume it must be a 3rd party AG filter then that is blocking https://www.quintadelarosa.com/?  It loads fine if I disable AdGuard.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2056454765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-15T10:10:52Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
