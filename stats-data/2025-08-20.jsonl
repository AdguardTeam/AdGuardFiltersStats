IRRELEVANT TO THIS ISSUE.\r\n> \r\n> So I noticed a problem when using Adguard filtering on my PC. Sometimes the site starts stuttering/lagging a lot with filtering on. \r\n> \r\n> I found that the issue is with \"stats\" being blocked on the site. I allowed it with this rule: `@@||music.youtube.com/api/stats/$domain=music.youtube.com`\r\n> \r\n> This completely fixed the lagging issue I had.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @user716253\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/1vmmrl0po9og008o4w80wwsw440sos05x29ucc7v1s.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/7qutn5oxh2o8s4kwsog0g8gswwgg0osii7d0sjpt0o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.21.1 (5081)\r\nSystem version: | `Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.26100.0`\r\nBrowser: | Brave\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.controld.com/`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Adblock List for Finland\r\nCustom filters: | `User rules (url: none)`\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | `AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)`<br>`AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)`<br>`Web of Trust (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js)`\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=true&custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.custom_bootstrap=&dns.custom_fallback=&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_mode=System&dns.filters=&dns.servers=https%3A%2F%2Fdns.controld.com%2F&dns.timeout=0&extensions=AdGuard%2520Extra%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29%2CAdGuard%2520Popup%2520Blocker%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fpopup-blocker%2F2.5%2Fpopupblocker.user.js%29%2CWeb%2520of%2520Trust%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-wot%2F1.0%2Fwot.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=2.3.4.10.17.18.19.208.233.251&license_type=paid&product_type=Win&product_version=7.21.1+%285081%29&scheme_version=2&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_third_party_auth=false&stealth.block_trackers=true&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=false&stealth.disable_wap_push_message_routing_service=false&stealth.disable_windows_defender=false&stealth.disable_windows_recall=true&stealth.disable_windows_telemetry=true&stealth.dpi=false&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.flash=false&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.java=false&stealth.location=false&stealth.push=false&stealth.strip_url=true&stealth.third_party_cookies=180&stealth.turn_off_advertising_id=true&stealth.webrtc=false&stealth.x_client=true&system_version=Microsoft+Windows+NT+10.0.26100.0&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F139.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&win.wfp=true)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3207811523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-08-20T19:35:11Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
