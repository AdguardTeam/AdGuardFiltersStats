can I suggest, if possible, for an employee or a group or employees to keep an eye on this site daily or multiple times a day, if possible. Last year one day they updated multiple times to try to circunvent AdGuard's measures, with @xglossyntx saying it was a cat and mouse game. uBlock Origin does a much better job in blocking this site's ads, because it has been multiple months since I do not see them while using it, and they blocked the last one they implemented quickly when I told them. They fought back but only managing to get that last implemented ad to circunvent uBlock Origin's measures, but since I told them about two weeks ago they fixed it and I didn't see it again, however they easily circunvent AdGuard's measures, usually like every two weeks, managing to make all ads visible again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2059016375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-16T12:50:10Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

can I suggest, if possible, for an employee or a group or employees to keep an eye on this site daily or multiple times a day, if possible. Last year one day they updated multiple times to try to circunvent AdGuard's measures, with @xglossyntx saying it was a cat and mouse game. uBlock Origin does a much better job in blocking this site's ads, because it has been multiple months since I do not see them while using it, and they blocked the last one they implemented quickly when I told them. They fought back but only managing to get that last implemented ad to circunvent uBlock Origin's measures, but since I told them about two weeks ago they fixed it and I didn't see it again, however they easily circunvent AdGuard's measures, usually like every two weeks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2059014128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-16T12:49:00Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
