@deltaxsingh Hello there. Unfortunately, I am unable to reproduce the ad. Could you please go to the AdGuard filter log (4th tab --> resent activity) and clear the filter log (three dots in the top right corner --> clear)? Open the app, replay the ad, go to the filter log, take screenshots of the filter log and attach the screenshots to a comment on GitHub?\r\n\r\nHere you go! It's ONLY in the Copilot app on Android.

Prerequisites\n\n- [X] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [X] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [X] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nThere are several large and empty divs that just say \"Advertisement\"\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/46940694/69ed42ff-4e67-4287-97a6-3d462236d15a)\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nHere is a filter using [uBlock's procedural cosmetic filters](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Procedural-cosmetic-filters) which blocks all the advertisements:\r\n```\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##div:matches-attr(class=\"/ad-placeholder-.*/\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason a regex was chosen here is that there are several differently named classes which the ads use.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to use a static filter, here is a list of css classes from ones I encountered, as well as which ones css classes exist for, however there may be additional ones:\r\n```\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-1\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-2\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-5\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-6\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-7\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-9\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-10\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-11\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-13\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-33\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-34\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-35\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-36\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-37\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-38\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-39\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-40\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-43\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-44\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-45\r\nwww.thehulltruth.com##.ad-placeholder-49\r\n```\r\nand yes, `ad-placeholder-8`, `ad-placeholder-12`, `ad-placeholder-14` to `ad-placeholder-32`, `ad-placeholder-41`, `ad-placeholder-42`, and `ad-placeholder-46` to `ad-placeholder-48` are missing. I do not know why, however they don't appear in their source. who knows. \n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182238/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-26T11:38:03Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

There is no specific rule in place to hide the ad placeholder. On PC, blocking the script reduces the size to 0, effectively hiding the ad frame. However, on iPhone, the iframe remains visible, which is why it's expected that the ad frame does not disappear. If there are any other reasons contributing to this behavior, please let me know for future reference.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4bjdqttcuxess8kgcowc4k8c00gwg0sf9ass8y38xw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bn4jtra0f6ok0ook80kwkc0wwoow8os1bv96pvu9cp.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oasxq2s796ow00css0wks8oo4408wg43e2qyleibo4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/ios/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182247/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-26T12:25:53Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

If there are any other reasons contributing to this behavior, please let me know for future reference.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4bjdqttcuxess8kgcowc4k8c00gwg0sf9ass8y38xw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bn4jtra0f6ok0ook80kwkc0wwoow8os1bv96pvu9cp.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oasxq2s796ow00css0wks8oo4408wg43e2qyleibo4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/ios/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182247/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2191654507","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182247#issuecomment-2191654507","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182247","id":2191654507,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86Cof5r","user":{"login":"Yuki2718","id":58900598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTAwNTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58900598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718","html_url":"https://github.com/Yuki2718","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-26T13:09:29Z","updated_at":"2024-06-26T13:09:29Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"`.site-group` and its header `#?#.card-panel.blue:contains(おすすめエロサイト)` are just recommending other sites and not ads.

If there are any other reasons contributing to this behavior, please let me know for future reference.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4bjdqttcuxess8kgcowc4k8c00gwg0sf9ass8y38xw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bn4jtra0f6ok0ook80kwkc0wwoow8os1bv96pvu9cp.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oasxq2s796ow00css0wks8oo4408wg43e2qyleibo4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/ios/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182247/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2191864837","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182247#issuecomment-2191864837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182247","id":2191864837,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86CpTQF","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-26T14:31:51Z","updated_at":"2024-06-26T14:31:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182247#issuecomment-2191654507 I guess it depends how to look on this.

There is no specific rule in place to hide the ad placeholder. On PC, blocking the script reduces the size to 0, effectively hiding the ad frame. However, on iPhone, the iframe remains visible, which is why it's expected that the ad frame does not disappear. If there are any other reasons contributing to this behavior, please let me know for future reference.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4bjdqttcuxess8kgcowc4k8c00gwg0sf9ass8y38xw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bn4jtra0f6ok0ook80kwkc0wwoow8os1bv96pvu9cp.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oasxq2s796ow00css0wks8oo4408wg43e2qyleibo4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/ios/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182247/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-26T14:27:21Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

There is no specific rule in place to hide the ad placeholder. On PC, blocking the script reduces the size to 0, effectively hiding the ad frame. However, on iPhone, the iframe remains visible, which is why it's expected that the ad frame does not disappear. If there are any other reasons contributing to this behavior, please let me know for future reference.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4bjdqttcuxess8kgcowc4k8c00gwg0sf9ass8y38xw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bn4jtra0f6ok0ook80kwkc0wwoow8os1bv96pvu9cp.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oasxq2s796ow00css0wks8oo4408wg43e2qyleibo4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/ios/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182247/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-26T14:22:40Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> При использовании приложения на iOS как с нативной реализацией, так и с adguard псевдо-vpn, показывается контекстная реклама. Браузер Chrome на iOS. DNS сервер: Adguard DNS (dns-over-quic). DNS фильтры: Adguard DNS filter. Тут все по умолчанию. Остальная реклама на сайтах или в приложениях блокируется успешно. Проблема только с контекстной рекламой.\r\nUsername: `@Ihor Kulik`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/71xw8zyc4mos0ko4ckkk448oggggwococ696gl5a68.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3z99ya18h7gg0o4kkosoo0k48c4c04oeltv2w49a74.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.4\r\nSystem version: | 17.5.1\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://dns.adguard-dns.com`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182236/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2192013067","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182236#issuecomment-2192013067","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182236","id":2192013067,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86Cp3cL","user":{"login":"igorkulik92","id":173933228,"node_id":"U_kgDOCl4CrA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173933228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92","html_url":"https://github.com/igorkulik92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-26T15:35:35Z","updated_at":"2024-06-26T15:35:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jellizaveta \r\n![IMG_6205](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/173933228/5fe9be00-d4af-4fa0-875f-61477b979a4d)\r\n![IMG_6204](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/173933228/4c0dc790-7781-4e75-9ac6-ea818d9eba95)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2192013067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-26T15:35:36Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> При использовании приложения на iOS как с нативной реализацией, так и с adguard псевдо-vpn, показывается контекстная реклама. Браузер Chrome на iOS. DNS сервер: Adguard DNS (dns-over-quic). DNS фильтры: Adguard DNS filter. Тут все по умолчанию. Остальная реклама на сайтах или в приложениях блокируется успешно. Проблема только с контекстной рекламой.\r\nUsername: `@Ihor Kulik`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/71xw8zyc4mos0ko4ckkk448oggggwococ696gl5a68.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3z99ya18h7gg0o4kkosoo0k48c4c04oeltv2w49a74.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.4\r\nSystem version: | 17.5.1\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://dns.adguard-dns.com`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182236/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2191954680","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182236#issuecomment-2191954680","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182236","id":2191954680,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86CppL4","user":{"login":"igorkulik92","id":173933228,"node_id":"U_kgDOCl4CrA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173933228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92","html_url":"https://github.com/igorkulik92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkulik92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-26T15:09:03Z","updated_at":"2024-06-26T15:09:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jellizaveta проблема происходит не в Safari, а в Chrome при выключенном DNS фильтре","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2191954680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-26T15:09:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
