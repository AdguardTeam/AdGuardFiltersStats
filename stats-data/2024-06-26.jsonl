@deltaxsingh Hello there. Unfortunately, I am unable to reproduce the ad. Could you please go to the AdGuard filter log (4th tab --> resent activity) and clear the filter log (three dots in the top right corner --> clear)? Open the app, replay the ad, go to the filter log, take screenshots of the filter log and attach the screenshots to a comment on GitHub?\r\n\r\nHere you go! It's ONLY in the Copilot app on Android.
