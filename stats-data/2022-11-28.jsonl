tried to watch a video this Adblock detector will pop up.  It prevents me from seeing any part of the video unless the AdGuard is disable.  I also noticed throughout the whole website random blank spaces are seen in specific spots. I believe these spaces are where ads are placed.  When I disable the AdGuard the ads will show up, but once it’s enable only black spaces remain in their spots.
