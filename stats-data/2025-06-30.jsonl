Comment\r\n\r\n```\r\nHi `@ADGuard` team,\r\n\r\nI'm writing to report an issue I encountered while using ADGuard.\r\n\r\nProblem Description\r\nADGuard is unable to fully block the ads as indicated in the image (attached or linked).\r\n\r\nMy Setup\r\nADGuard Version: 5.1.102\r\nPlatform: Windows\r\nReproduction Steps\r\nEnabled all default filters.\r\nAdded the following custom filtering rules:\r\nbilibili.com``.recommended-swipe\r\nbilibili.com``.floor-card-inner\r\nVisited bilibili.com and observed that some ads were still displayed.\r\nAdditional Information\r\nIf you need a screenshot or more detailed rule behavior, I’d be happy to provide it.\r\n\r\nThank you for your hard work on ADGuard — it's a great product!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n`@Meartraep`\r\n```\r\n```\r\nUsername: @Meartraep\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
