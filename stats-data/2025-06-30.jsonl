Comment\r\n\r\n```\r\nHi `@ADGuard` team,\r\n\r\nI'm writing to report an issue I encountered while using ADGuard.\r\n\r\nProblem Description\r\nADGuard is unable to fully block the ads as indicated in the image (attached or linked).\r\n\r\nMy Setup\r\nADGuard Version: 5.1.102\r\nPlatform: Windows\r\nReproduction Steps\r\nEnabled all default filters.\r\nAdded the following custom filtering rules:\r\nbilibili.com``.recommended-swipe\r\nbilibili.com``.floor-card-inner\r\nVisited bilibili.com and observed that some ads were still displayed.\r\nAdditional Information\r\nIf you need a screenshot or more detailed rule behavior, I’d be happy to provide it.\r\n\r\nThank you for your hard work on ADGuard — it's a great product!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n`@Meartraep`\r\n```\r\n```\r\nUsername: @Meartraep\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Comment\r\n> Программа тормозит, слишком часто (каждые полчаса) приводит в сбою браузера и зависанию компьютера. Пропускает много рекламы на разных сайтах, хотя было 12 фильтров. ничего не менялось - это после обновления Адгвард 14 июня 2025.\r\n> Новый интерфейс неудобный - не видно, что. где и сколько включено.\r\n>  Реклама в почте Гугл и Яндекс чувствует себя прекрасно, Адгвард её  не ограничивает, ограничивает только мой компьютер. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/5vkusytezu8sw80wocs4k4wckw088k4nbojgnlpuxc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v8.0.0 nightly 3 (5080)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.19045.0\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)<br><br>**Browser API**:<br>Block Location API<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`, `User rules (url: none)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters\r\nCustom filters: | User rules (url: none)\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant (Beta) (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js)<br>AdGuard Extra (Beta) (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (Beta) (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)<br>Web of Trust (Beta) (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Windows defender\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=true&clid=DyfstK--UOyLYv--mHs3ue--E4q7gA--w1Xn3q--IXg0Se--nhCXg2&custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.custom_bootstrap=&dns.custom_fallback=&dns.custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_mode=System&dns.filters=1&dns.servers=System&dns.timeout=0&extensions=AdGuard%2520Assistant%2520%28Beta%29%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Fbeta%2Fassistant%2F4.3%2Fassistant.user.js%29%2CAdGuard%2520Extra%2520%28Beta%29%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Fbeta%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29%2CAdGuard%2520Popup%2520Blocker%2520%28Beta%29%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Fbeta%2Fpopup-blocker%2F2.5%2Fpopupblocker.user.js%29%2CWeb%2520of%2520Trust%2520%28Beta%29%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Fbeta%2Fadguard-wot%2F1.0%2Fwot.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=1.2.5.10.18.23.212.249&license_type=paid&product_type=Win&product_version=8.0.0+nightly+3+%285080%29&scheme_version=2&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_third_party_auth=false&stealth.block_trackers=false&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=false&stealth.disable_wap_push_message_routing_service=false&stealth.disable_windows_defender=false&stealth.disable_windows_recall=true&stealth.disable_windows_telemetry=true&stealth.dpi=false&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.flash=false&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.java=false&stealth.location=true&stealth.push=false&stealth.strip_url=false&stealth.third_party_cookies=180&stealth.turn_off_advertising_id=true&stealth.webrtc=false&stealth.x_client=true&system_version=Microsoft+Windows+NT+10.0.19045.0&utm_campaign=report&utm_medium=assistant&utm_source=win&win.wfp=true)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208250/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-30T10:38:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
