Comment\r\n> Hello.\r\n> \r\n> First of all, I would like to inform you that in order to send this application, I had to switch from the alpha version of the Adguard application for Windows to the stable version, because in the alpha version the application form does not detect any settings of my program.\r\n> \r\n> The above report concerns Disney+, namely the VOD platform, when Adguard is active it takes a very long time to load even though according to the browser the page is already loaded.\r\n> \r\n> This makes it quite difficult to use the VOD service on your computer\r\n> \r\n> Additionally, I will add that I checked whether this is caused by one of the blocking lists I use and I can confirm with full confidence that this is not the case, and the website only starts working properly when the entire Windows application is suspended. disabling filtering from the assistant plugin has no effect.\r\nUsername: `@grzenio22`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n

after latest updates I start to face a lot of issues while AdGuard is enabled. A lot of websites either not opening or needs to refresh the page multiple times to get it works. Keep in mind that I’ve not changed anything recently either in my WIN11 OS, BitDefender AntiVirus or AdGuard itself, and everything was totally working fine previously.\r\n> For example, https://ipass.cma.org.sa/ if AG is enabled the website won’t open at all.

after latest updates I start to face a lot of issues while AdGuard is enabled. A lot of websites either not opening or needs to refresh the page multiple times to get it works. Keep in mind that I’ve not changed anything recently either in my WIN11 OS, BitDefender AntiVirus or AdGuard itself, and everything was totally working fine previously.\r\n> For example, https://ipass.cma.org.sa/ if AG is enabled the website won’t open at all. But If I totally disable AG the website will open normally.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/diubprcoaqgcs0cc4k4okg0ck8kkcoog8a9ugayg4g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/5ceg6a5e4ao0k88ssw48sss4wsog004p00v71dbpes.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.18.1 (4778)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.22631.0\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block trackers, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/windows/filters/15.txt`, `User rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>Estonian List, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>IndianList</details>\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | BitDefender AntiVirus and AdGuard, No other AdBlocker Ext\r\n\r\n### Import issue configuration (AdGuard for Windows)\r\n[Import](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=adguard%3Aimport_user_configuration%3Fbrowsing_security.enabled%3Dtrue%26browsing_security.statistics_enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.custom_bootstrap%3D%26dns.custom_fallback%3D%26dns.enabled%3Dtrue%26dns.fallback_mode%3DSystem%26dns.filters%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ffilters.adtidy.org%252Fwindows%252Ffilters%252F15.txt%252CUser%2Brules%26dns.filters_enabled%3Dtrue%26dns.servers%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdns.adguard-dns.com%252Fdns-query%26dns.timeout%3D0%26filters%3D103.105.109.112.218.235.243.14.16.1.224.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.253%26license_type%3Dpaid%26parental_control.block_exe%3Dfalse%26parental_control.enabled%3Dtrue%26parental_control.safe_search%3Dfalse%26product_type%3DWin%26product_version%3D7.18.1%2B%25284778%2529%26referrer%3D%26stealth.DNT%3Dtrue%26stealth.block_third_party_auth%3Dfalse%26stealth.block_trackers%3Dtrue%26stealth.disable_third_party_cache%3Dfalse%26stealth.disable_wap_push_message_routing_service%3Dfalse%26stealth.disable_windows_defender%3Dfalse%26stealth.disable_windows_telemetry%3Dtrue%26stealth.dpi%3Dfalse%26stealth.enabled%3Dtrue%26stealth.flash%3Dfalse%26stealth.hide_search_queries%3Dtrue%26stealth.java%3Dfalse%26stealth.location%3Dfalse%26stealth.push%3Dfalse%26stealth.strip_url%3Dfalse%26stealth.third_party_cookies%3D180%26stealth.turn_off_advertising_id%3Dtrue%26stealth.webrtc%3Dfalse%26stealth.x_client%3Dtrue%26system_version%3DMicrosoft%2BWindows%2BNT%2B10.0.22631.0%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fipass.cma.org.sa%252F%26user_agent%3DMozilla%252F5.0%2B%2528Windows%2BNT%2B10.0%253B%2BWin64%253B%2Bx64%2529%2BAppleWebKit%252F537.36%2B%2528KHTML%252C%2Blike%2BGecko%2529%2BChrome%252F127.0.0.0%2BSafari%252F537.36%26userscripts%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fadguard-extra%252F1.0%252Fadguard-extra.user.js%252Chttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fpopup-blocker%252F2.5%252Fpopupblocker.user.js%26utm_campaign%3Dreport%26utm_medium%3Dassistant%26utm_source%3Dwin%26win.wfp%3Dtrue)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-16T13:53:49Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
