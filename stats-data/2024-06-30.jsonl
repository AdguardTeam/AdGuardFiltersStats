I didn't retry all the other ticker numbers with the annoyance filters enabled but I did do a few the other day and updated those tickets. They have the same behavior as what I'm experiencing here so I would assume even the untested ones would do the same. These websites are from links from the Google Discover feed.

With the filter enabled, for this report, I get a blank white page instead of content. With the filters off, I get the pop-up that an adblocker has been detected. I didn't retry all the other ticker numbers with the annoyance filters enabled but I did do a few the other day and updated those tickets. They have the same behavior as what I'm experiencing here so I would assume even the untested ones would do the same. These websites are from links from the Google Discover feed. They have the same exact behavior if I try to open them in the Google app as they do on Chrome\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/nlkr5rfkda8w8osww0scc4soo8o0cwgd5m1k4fwcw0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.5\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Eset security ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182605/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2198662142","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182605#issuecomment-2198662142","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182605","id":2198662142,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86DDOv-","user":{"login":"BlazDT","id":34266271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjY2Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34266271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT","html_url":"https://github.com/BlazDT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-30T19:42:52Z","updated_at":"2024-06-30T19:42:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As mentioned in other issue please post a screenshot of filtering log, especially following requests:\r\n\r\n```\r\nambrosialsummit.com\r\nsucceedscene.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso disable all third-party filters and only leave filters active with \"AdGuard\" in its name.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2198662142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-30T19:42:54Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Sometimes even touching the page will open a new tab and it opens ads. This did not used to happen and has only been happening in the last few weeks across lots of similar websites that it didn't used to before. I've tried updating etc but it keeps opening new tabs with ads whenever uou try and read any new chapter. The screenshot only shows the tab that opened up when I clicked on a chapter but not the loaded page because the url keeps going up in number and I get rid of it before it fully loads because it looks suspicious. \r\nUsername: `@Meep`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/lv5hezrmmm80sck0sw0gsg4wwcgwcg8c98e0g49t4g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.5\r\nSystem version: | Android 11\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | disabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Liste AR\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/182618/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-30T21:52:15Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
