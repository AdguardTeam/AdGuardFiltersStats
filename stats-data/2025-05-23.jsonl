reklamların engellenmesinde herhangi bir problem yaşamadım. Ancak adguard'ın son güncellemesini yaptıktan sonra bu sitede karşıma reklamlar çıkmaya başladı. Güncellemeden sonra başka bir sitede böyle bir sıkıntım olmadı, dolayısıyla sorunun sizin güncellemenizde olduğunu sanmıyorum. Siteye girişte reklam bulunduğu gibi herhangi bir videonun başlangıcında da 10 saniyelik geçilemeyen reklamlarla karşı karşıya kalıyorum. Yardımınız için çok teşekkür ederim.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/q3dr6052o8gocwgs0k88sc80wkkk0w8p8p4b50v8uo.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/9mm48axxs1kwsws08wo04kw8s4g4ckcmwa6wggy60w.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.22\r\nSystem version: | MacOS Sequoia 15.4 (24E248)\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Turkish","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205780/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-23T05:01:58Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
