The way the ad is composed, instead of a straight URL (i.e. something like: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSGTN8DT?ref=emc_p_m_5_i_atc), these ad links always start off with \"https://www.amazon.com/sspa/click?ie=\" (note the \"sspa\"). The \"sspa\" related links always return a \"SORRY we couldn't find that page ... try searching or go to Amazon's home page.\" I've have pretty much ALL features in AdGuard turned on, but these items remain\r\nUsername: `@SPWilkins`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/7k26c82iyvc4kckk0wock8k8go0o8g4r4nrsvp3jes.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/k2walpi9sc0oskwsco48g4sgo840g4caallg1um0q8.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.49 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nTracking protection options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>List-KR</details>\r\nCustom filters: | https://www.joinhoney.com/whitelist/honey-smart-shopping.txt\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Better Subscriptions for YouTube, Capital One Shopping Save Now, Copyfish - Free OCR Software, DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials, ESET Browser Privacy & Security, , Enhancer for YouTube™, Microsoft Outlook, OneNote Web Clipper, PDF0XChange, PayPal Honey, Share-A-Cart, Twitter Video Downloader, X media Downloader, uBlock Origin","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199705/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2690216319","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199705#issuecomment-2690216319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199705","id":2690216319,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86gWXF_","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-28T09:55:07Z","updated_at":"2025-02-28T09:55:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's fixed for all platforms, so you should wait for the extension or app to download the new update.

The way the ad is composed, instead of a straight URL (i.e. something like: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSGTN8DT?ref=emc_p_m_5_i_atc), these ad links always start off with \"https://www.amazon.com/sspa/click?ie=\" (note the \"sspa\"). The \"sspa\" related links always return a \"SORRY we couldn't find that page ... try searching or go to Amazon's home page.\" I've have pretty much ALL features in AdGuard turned on, but these items remain\r\nUsername: `@SPWilkins`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/7k26c82iyvc4kckk0wock8k8go0o8g4r4nrsvp3jes.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/k2walpi9sc0oskwsco48g4sgo840g4caallg1um0q8.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.49 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nTracking protection options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>List-KR</details>\r\nCustom filters: | https://www.joinhoney.com/whitelist/honey-smart-shopping.txt\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Better Subscriptions for YouTube, Capital One Shopping Save Now, Copyfish - Free OCR Software, DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials, ESET Browser Privacy & Security, , Enhancer for YouTube™, Microsoft Outlook, OneNote Web Clipper, PDF0XChange, PayPal Honey, Share-A-Cart, Twitter Video Downloader, X media Downloader, uBlock Origin","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199705/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2690199765","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199705#issuecomment-2690199765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199705","id":2690199765,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86gWTDV","user":{"login":"SPWilkins","id":57503030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTAzMDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57503030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SPWilkins","html_url":"https://github.com/SPWilkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SPWilkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SPWilkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SPWilkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SPWilkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SPWilkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SPWilkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SPWilkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SPWilkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SPWilkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-28T09:47:34Z","updated_at":"2025-02-28T09:47:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Cool, will this require the app or will my client (who ONLY uses the extension) also see relief ???","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2690199765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-02-28T09:47:35Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Its been weeks i am reporting it to adguard and they have been no help at all which is really frustrating. \r\nUsername: `@Sakciit`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/aj9oevp8rdsg4sgsck0kkwccw00go0g14cun3c8hri.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ocen7n1xrsgswcggk8wgsgck0sk084cmk99gtx9yis.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6vtlcst5fi0wwcwwk8888owc0okkws82v22k5pdu9c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.8\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets\r\nOther extensions used: | Non","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2690684612","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236#issuecomment-2690684612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236","id":2690684612,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86gYJbE","user":{"login":"sakciit","id":196661562,"node_id":"U_kgDOC7jROg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/196661562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit","html_url":"https://github.com/sakciit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-28T13:44:00Z","updated_at":"2025-02-28T13:44:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"AdGuard used to block ads on almost every app, but it’s becoming hard for you guys to admit there’s an issue. Perhaps it’s because only a small group of users are experiencing it, which is why there seems to be a lack of interest in investigating further. Just take a look at this screenshot: the filters fail to update, and the saved data is only 9.87 MB, when it used to be around 700–800 MB daily. This clearly indicates that something is wrong. I don’t know exactly how AdGuard works technically, but I do remember the statistics and the relief it provided when it used to work properly.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18542ab7-3179-4f66-90bb-95860706a40c)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2690684612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-02-28T13:44:01Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

To filter sites we use Safari Content Clocker  API - it is a black box for us. We simply corvert the filters into a format it understands and give them to the Content Blocking API. It is impossible to control how this API functions. Filtering can break down for no apparent reason. Therefore, we periodically advise you to re-enable AdGuard in iOS settings and update filters. The second method of filtering is Advanced Protection, for applying rules that are not natively supported by iOS. It doesn't work perfectly either, as it's a workaround. \nThe last method is DNS filtering. In this case it is only possible to block advertising/tracking domains. But in the whole system. If the main domain of a service is used for advertising, it is impossible to block such advertising by DNS (for applications, this is the only possible option, unlike Android, where there is more freedom of action)\nMost likely, some of the apps (social network apps) didn't show ads before, and when they determined that it WORTH showing ads to you, the ads turned on. For example, I rarely open Facebook and there are no ads with my account.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2690961796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-02-28T15:36:15Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nSome sites (such as dealabs.com, to quote one I know) track by passing each clicks through advertising agencies.\nWith the new version of the $urltransform tool, you can finally “clean up” the links.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nhttps://dealabs.digidip.net/visit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lycamobile.fr%2Ffr%2Fbundle%2Fforfait-lyca-s-plus-200gb%2F&ppref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dealabs.com%2F&ref=ppr-fr-1714412352\n\nto gives https://www.lycamobile.fr/fr/bundle/forfait-lyca-s-plus-200gb/\n\nhttps://dealabs.digidip.net/visit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdiscount.com%2Finformatique%2Fssd%2Fssd-interne-samsung-990-evo-plus-2-to-nvme-m%2Ff-10703-sam8806095575650.html&ppref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dealabs.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Deffiliation.com&ref=ppr-fr-1714418097\n\nto give https://www.cdiscount.com/informatique/ssd/ssd-interne-samsung-990-evo-plus-2-to-nvme-m/f-10703-sam8806095575650.html\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n```\n/^https?:\\/\\/(?:[a-z0-9-]+\\.)*?dealabs\\.digidip\\.net\\/visit\\?url=/$urltransform=/%3A/:/\n/^https?:\\/\\/(?:[a-z0-9-]+\\.)*?dealabs\\.digidip\\.net\\/visit\\?url=/$urltransform=/%2F/\\//\n/^https?:\\/\\/(?:[a-z0-9-]+\\.)*?dealabs\\.digidip\\.net\\/visit\\?url=/$urltransform=/%3F/?/\n/^https?:\\/\\/(?:[a-z0-9-]+\\.)*?dealabs\\.digidip\\.net\\/visit\\?url=/$urltransform=/%3D/=/\n/^https?:\\/\\/(?:[a-z0-9-]+\\.)*?dealabs\\.digidip\\.net\\/visit\\?url=/$urltransform=/^https?:\\/\\/(?:[a-z0-9-]+\\.)*?dealabs\\.digidip\\.net.*url=([^&]*).*/\\$1/\n```\n\nThe first 4 rules are only for decoding special characters, as the $urltransform tool unfortunately can't do this ([yet](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1915)). When it does, these rules could be removed.\n\nKR,\n\n\n\n\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197963/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197963/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2690858906","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197963#issuecomment-2690858906","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197963","id":2690858906,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86gYz-a","user":{"login":"imTHAI","id":36070606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDcwNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36070606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imTHAI","html_url":"https://github.com/imTHAI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imTHAI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imTHAI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imTHAI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imTHAI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imTHAI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imTHAI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imTHAI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imTHAI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imTHAI/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-28T14:59:07Z","updated_at":"2025-02-28T14:59:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Alex-302 \nYou're the best Alex, thank you very much. \nThe Adguard team is definitely a cut above the rest.
