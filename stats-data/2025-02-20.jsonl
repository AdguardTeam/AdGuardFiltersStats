photo. I love ad guard for other sites but its failing to stop ads and pop ups on twitch.com. Please help. My silly screenshot shows the ad running, but I couldn't catch the pop-up in time.

Настройки расширения невозможно сохранить, кнопки сохранить нету, поэтому предполагаю, что они автоматически сохраняются, нажимаю отключить языковые фильтры, при следующем обновлении страницы мне показывается окно, которое раздражает, о включении фильтра. Может быть я что-то не так делаю, что у вашего расширения для браузера не получается сохранить настройки или может быть это в принципе невозможно, но тогда смысл такого расширения. Надеюсь на скорейшее разрешение вопроса, всего Вам доброго.\r\nUsername: `@rwerwerwr1234142`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bbsvixmnka0ogsckwk00k00k4ck88knd2ehhogeaok.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/7hc1wywnh7s4s4koc4s48kkw84kcc8wjsoi5xzmz34.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.49 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection options: | \r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2670603851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-02-20T06:46:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

В обоих случаях вынужден искать новый продукт. \r\nUsername: `@Сэтролл`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qdcjtmb4vogkwokw44c0ckw44cwowc4g2vua09x8tc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.8\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Браузер Samsung Internet\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Dr.web","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199031/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2670772358","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199031#issuecomment-2670772358","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199031","id":2670772358,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86fMMCG","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-20T08:21:53Z","updated_at":"2025-02-20T08:21:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Рекламы на сайте не наблюдаю.\r\n\r\n> Раньше и в играх и на сайтах не было рекламы благодаря adguard\r\n\r\nБесплатная версия не может фильтровать трафик в приложениях.\r\nЧто касается сайтов, то нужно проверить какой именно сертификат использует браузер.

It can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> Saving memory feature of your web browser or sleep feature of your operating system can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n> In this case, please re-enable AdGuard's filtering by toggling the protection toggle.\n> Following the instructions can be needed.\n\n### The instructions\n1. Force to update the filters by clicking the reload button in AdGuard Browser Extension/AdGuard mobile or update tray menu in your system tray. [^2]\n2. Reload the YouTube webpage without cache by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> [^3].\n3. Clear cache, cookies and site data of your web browser.\n4. Re-open your web browser completely (checking your system monitor[^4] will be better).\n\n[^1]: https://gitlab.com/adblockinc/ext/adblockplus/adblockplusui/-/issues/1576\n[^2]: [AdGuard for Windows](https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-windows/overview/#tray-menu); [AdGuard for Mac](https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-mac/overview/#updates-check); \n[^3]: On macOS, <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>\n[^4]: Task Manager on Windows, System Monitor on GNOME Shell, KDE System Guard on KDE Plasma or Activity Monitor on macOS. \n\n\nPrevious issue https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/194856","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198973/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2671291688","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198973#issuecomment-2671291688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198973","id":2671291688,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86fOK0o","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-20T11:59:49Z","updated_at":"2025-02-20T11:59:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0NJ3KqMjKY&list=TLPQMjAwMjIwMjWwiMEKTiX3Ww&index=2](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZ0NJ3KqMjKY%26list%3DTLPQMjAwMjIwMjWwiMEKTiX3Ww%26index%3D2)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Particularly happens between videos in a playlist or on a long video, end up with an unskippable ad that just displays a blank screen & a timecode in the playhead for an ad break, after the length of the ad has elapsed it will either display a second blank ad or return to the video.\r\nUsername: `@jmcudk`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ptjvl93imdc4sw48404cso0wocwcwscdxdwedh6oo0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.20\r\nSystem version: | macOS  15.3.1\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection\r\nOther extensions used: | Better TDeck, LastPass for Safari, Todoist","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2671291688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-02-20T11:59:51Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
