photo. I love ad guard for other sites but its failing to stop ads and pop ups on twitch.com. Please help. My silly screenshot shows the ad running, but I couldn't catch the pop-up in time. Its a transparent overlay that stays up until I interact with the buttons? I think they say \"return to stream\" and \"buy turbo\" or something like that. This ad-block failure seems relatively new?
