Если включить из блока фильтров Блокировка раздражителей даже только этот один фильтр Фильтр всплывающих окон а другие фильтры из раздела Блокировка раздражителей не включать то эта проблема всё-равно сразу же воспользводится. Считаю что эта проблема очень критичная и её нужно исправить как можно скорее.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://dzen.ru](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdzen.ru)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Фильтр всплывающих окон (находится в разделе фильтров \"Блокировка раздражителей\") в AdGuard для Android (версия AdGuard 4.2 (4.2.118)) (проблемная версия этого фильтра 2.0.25.79) мешает нормальной работе при поиске в Яндексе. \r\n> Сценарий воспроизведения проблемы:\r\n> 1) Открываем в браузере (штатный браузер Android Google Chrome версии 118.0.5993.111) yandex.ru при этом происходит переадресация на dzen.ru\r\n> 2) Ищем там что-нибудь в поиске от Яндекса\r\n> 3) И переходим в раздел/вкладку результатов поиска по видео/в виде видео\r\n> 4) Затем пробуем открыть из этого раздела любой результат поиска в виде видео\r\n> 5) Результат поиска не открывается\r\n> 6) А если принудительно открыть результат поиска в новой вкладке браузера (через соответствующий пункт контекстного меню браузера) то как минимум внизу под видео не загружается информация о предлагаемых поисковиком других похожих/подобных видео а иногда и само выбранное видео-результат поиска так же тем не менее не загружается/не отображается.\r\n> При отключении этого Фильтра всплывающих окон в AdGuard проблема не воспроизводится. Если включить из блока фильтров Блокировка раздражителей даже только этот один фильтр Фильтр всплывающих окон а другие фильтры из раздела Блокировка раздражителей не включать то эта проблема всё-равно сразу же воспользводится.

разделе фильтров \"Блокировка раздражителей\") в AdGuard для Android (версия AdGuard 4.2 (4.2.118)) (проблемная версия этого фильтра 2.0.25.79) мешает нормальной работе при поиске в Яндексе. \r\n> Сценарий воспроизведения проблемы:\r\n> 1) Открываем в браузере (штатный браузер Android Google Chrome версии 118.0.5993.111) yandex.ru при этом происходит переадресация на dzen.ru\r\n> 2) Ищем там что-нибудь в поиске от Яндекса\r\n> 3) И переходим в раздел/вкладку результатов поиска по видео/в виде видео\r\n> 4) Затем пробуем открыть из этого раздела любой результат поиска в виде видео\r\n> 5) Результат поиска не открывается\r\n> 6) А если принудительно открыть результат поиска в новой вкладке браузера (через соответствующий пункт контекстного меню браузера) то как минимум внизу под видео не загружается информация о предлагаемых поисковиком других похожих/подобных видео а иногда и само выбранное видео-результат поиска так же тем не менее не загружается/не отображается.\r\n> При отключении этого Фильтра всплывающих окон в AdGuard проблема не воспроизводится. Если включить из блока фильтров Блокировка раздражителей даже только этот один фильтр Фильтр всплывающих окон а другие фильтры из раздела Блокировка раздражителей не включать то эта проблема всё-равно сразу же воспользводится.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://dzen.ru](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdzen.ru)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Фильтр всплывающих окон (находится в разделе фильтров \"Блокировка раздражителей\") в AdGuard для Android (версия AdGuard 4.2 (4.2.118)) (проблемная версия этого фильтра 2.0.25.79) мешает нормальной работе при поиске в Яндексе. \r\n> Сценарий воспроизведения проблемы:\r\n> 1) Открываем в браузере (штатный браузер Android Google Chrome версии 118.0.5993.111) yandex.ru при этом происходит переадресация на dzen.ru\r\n> 2) Ищем там что-нибудь в поиске от Яндекса\r\n> 3) И переходим в раздел/вкладку результатов поиска по видео/в виде видео\r\n> 4) Затем пробуем открыть из этого раздела любой результат поиска в виде видео\r\n> 5) Результат поиска не открывается\r\n> 6) А если принудительно открыть результат поиска в новой вкладке браузера (через соответствующий пункт контекстного меню браузера) то как минимум внизу под видео не загружается информация о предлагаемых поисковиком других похожих/подобных видео а иногда и само выбранное видео-результат поиска так же тем не менее не загружается/не отображается.\r\n> При отключении этого Фильтра всплывающих окон в AdGuard проблема не воспроизводится. Если включить из блока фильтров Блокировка раздражителей даже только этот один фильтр Фильтр всплывающих окон а другие фильтры из раздела Блокировка раздражителей не включать то эта проблема всё-равно сразу же воспользводится.

разделе фильтров \"Блокировка раздражителей\") в AdGuard для Android (версия AdGuard 4.2 (4.2.118)) (проблемная версия этого фильтра 2.0.25.79) мешает нормальной работе при поиске в Яндексе. \r\n> Сценарий воспроизведения проблемы:\r\n> 1) Открываем в браузере (штатный браузер Android Google Chrome версии 118.0.5993.111) yandex.ru при этом происходит переадресация на dzen.ru\r\n> 2) Ищем там что-нибудь в поиске от Яндекса\r\n> 3) И переходим в раздел/вкладку результатов поиска по видео/в виде видео\r\n> 4) Затем пробуем открыть из этого раздела любой результат поиска в виде видео\r\n> 5) Результат поиска не открывается\r\n> 6) А если принудительно открыть результат поиска в новой вкладке браузера (через соответствующий пункт контекстного меню браузера) то как минимум внизу под видео не загружается информация о предлагаемых поисковиком других похожих/подобных видео а иногда и само выбранное видео-результат поиска так же тем не менее не загружается/не отображается.\r\n> При отключении этого Фильтра всплывающих окон в AdGuard проблема не воспроизводится. Если включить из блока фильтров Блокировка раздражителей даже только этот один фильтр Фильтр всплывающих окон а другие фильтры из раздела Блокировка раздражителей не включать то эта проблема всё-равно сразу же воспользводится.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://dzen.ru](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdzen.ru)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Фильтр всплывающих окон (находится в разделе фильтров \"Блокировка раздражителей\") в AdGuard для Android (версия AdGuard 4.2 (4.2.118)) (проблемная версия этого фильтра 2.0.25.79) мешает нормальной работе при поиске в Яндексе. \r\n> Сценарий воспроизведения проблемы:\r\n> 1) Открываем в браузере (штатный браузер Android Google Chrome версии 118.0.5993.111) yandex.ru при этом происходит переадресация на dzen.ru\r\n> 2) Ищем там что-нибудь в поиске от Яндекса\r\n> 3) И переходим в раздел/вкладку результатов поиска по видео/в виде видео\r\n> 4) Затем пробуем открыть из этого раздела любой результат поиска в виде видео\r\n> 5) Результат поиска не открывается\r\n> 6) А если принудительно открыть результат поиска в новой вкладке браузера (через соответствующий пункт контекстного меню браузера) то как минимум внизу под видео не загружается информация о предлагаемых поисковиком других похожих/подобных видео а иногда и само выбранное видео-результат поиска так же тем не менее не загружается/не отображается.\r\n> При отключении этого Фильтра всплывающих окон в AdGuard проблема не воспроизводится. Если включить из блока фильтров Блокировка раздражителей даже только этот один фильтр Фильтр всплывающих окон а другие фильтры из раздела Блокировка раздражителей не включать то эта проблема всё-равно сразу же воспользводится. Считаю что эта проблема очень критичная и её нужно исправить как можно скорее.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://dzen.ru](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdzen.ru)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Фильтр всплывающих окон (находится в разделе фильтров \"Блокировка раздражителей\") в AdGuard для Android (версия AdGuard 4.2 (4.2.118)) (проблемная версия этого фильтра 2.0.25.79) мешает нормальной работе при поиске в Яндексе. \r\n> Сценарий воспроизведения проблемы:\r\n> 1) Открываем в браузере (штатный браузер Android Google Chrome версии 118.0.5993.111) yandex.ru при этом происходит переадресация на dzen.ru\r\n> 2) Ищем там что-нибудь в поиске от Яндекса\r\n> 3) И переходим в раздел/вкладку результатов поиска по видео/в виде видео\r\n> 4) Затем пробуем открыть из этого раздела любой результат поиска в виде видео\r\n> 5) Результат поиска не открывается\r\n> 6) А если принудительно открыть результат поиска в новой вкладке браузера (через соответствующий пункт контекстного меню браузера) то как минимум внизу под видео не загружается информация о предлагаемых поисковиком других похожих/подобных видео а иногда и само выбранное видео-результат поиска так же тем не менее не загружается/не отображается.\r\n> При отключении этого Фильтра всплывающих окон в AdGuard проблема не воспроизводится. Если включить из блока фильтров Блокировка раздражителей даже только этот один фильтр Фильтр всплывающих окон а другие фильтры из раздела Блокировка раздражителей не включать то эта проблема всё-равно сразу же воспользводится.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://dzen.ru](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdzen.ru)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Фильтр всплывающих окон (находится в разделе фильтров \"Блокировка раздражителей\") в AdGuard для Android (версия AdGuard 4.2 (4.2.118)) (проблемная версия этого фильтра 2.0.25.79) мешает нормальной работе при поиске в Яндексе. \r\n> Сценарий воспроизведения проблемы:\r\n> 1) Открываем в браузере (штатный браузер Android Google Chrome версии 118.0.5993.111) yandex.ru при этом происходит переадресация на dzen.ru\r\n> 2) Ищем там что-нибудь в поиске от Яндекса\r\n> 3) И переходим в раздел/вкладку результатов поиска по видео/в виде видео\r\n> 4) Затем пробуем открыть из этого раздела любой результат поиска в виде видео\r\n> 5) Результат поиска не открывается\r\n> 6) А если принудительно открыть результат поиска в новой вкладке браузера (через соответствующий пункт контекстного меню браузера) то как минимум внизу под видео не загружается информация о предлагаемых поисковиком других похожих/подобных видео а иногда и само выбранное видео-результат поиска так же тем не менее не загружается/не отображается.\r\n> При отключении этого Фильтра всплывающих окон в AdGuard проблема не воспроизводится. Если включить из блока фильтров Блокировка раздражителей даже только этот один фильтр Фильтр всплывающих окон а другие фильтры из раздела Блокировка раздражителей не включать то эта проблема всё-равно сразу же воспользводится. Считаю что эта проблема очень критичная и её нужно исправить как можно скорее.
