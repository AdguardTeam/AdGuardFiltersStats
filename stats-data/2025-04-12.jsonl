Comment\r\n> I am using AdGuard 4.9 on a Pixel 4a with Android 13.  My Hotmail account has been added to the Gmail app.  I am unable to retrieve new mail from my Hotmail account when AdGuard is enabled and I am connected to Wi-Fi (any Wi-Fi, not just at home).  There are a few ways I can successfully retrieve new messages from Hotmail:\r\n> \r\n>      If I use cellular data and AdGuard is enabled, I am able to successfully retrieve new messages.\r\n>      If I use Wi-Fi and disable AdGuard, I am able to successfully retrieve new messages.\r\n>      If I use Wi-Fi and AdGuard is enabled, I can use a web browser to access Hotmail.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> So, to summarize, I am unable to retrieve new Hotmail messages in the following scenario:  connected to Wi-Fi, using the Gmail app, AdGuard enabled\r\n> \r\n> I believe I have been seeing this issue for quite a while, but just recently realized it was related to AdGuard.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/87cdw8sf1l4400k0owg4408sc8gkg8cj95xelu9u4o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/76wbpdlpas8wo0wc48kskkg8oggg00w4wln06mw6k2.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.9\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Brave\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `DNS server for other cases`, ` 75.75.75.75`, ` 75.75.76.76`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS filter (Optimized)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/202397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/202397/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2798807748","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/202397#issuecomment-2798807748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/202397","id":2798807748,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86m0mrE","user":{"login":"csquaredin","id":117377356,"node_id":"U_kgDOBv8JTA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/117377356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csquaredin","html_url":"https://github.com/csquaredin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csquaredin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csquaredin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csquaredin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csquaredin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csquaredin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csquaredin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csquaredin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csquaredin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csquaredin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-12T12:11:25Z","updated_at":"2025-04-12T12:11:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Hi.
