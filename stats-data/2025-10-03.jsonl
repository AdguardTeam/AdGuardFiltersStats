ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript.

Comment\r\n> Enable DNS in Adguard for IOS App and try to use the butterflyMX app and it won’t work. The app will fail and it says can’t connect to network. \r\n> Also if I have the DNS enabled and I am watching YouTube in the YouTube app and a phone call comes in and I answer it. The phone freezes.

was running correctly before 2nd October 2025 (considering my rooted setup); no root changes, profiles or module alterations were made between 1st October and today.\r\n> \r\n> Unfortunately, it stopped working properly since; startup is slow, authentication via biometrics fails (as in, it accepts it but srill shows the PIN keypad as if nothing happened), and accessing sensitive screens (after manually inputting my pin) results in a loading spinner animation for about 10 seconds before it shows an error message.\r\n> \r\n> I've tried disabling multiple Adblock options, Tracking parameters, DNS filtering, nothing changes; the app works again if I disable Adguard entirely, or if I disable the \"Filter traffic\" for the app.\r\n> \r\n> The filtered logs barely show any trace of a blocked query related to the app.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @Keyaku\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

For the past couple of weeks, I have noticed problems with \"Schale Network\" websites whenever Adguard for Windows is enabled. As you can see in my screenshots, if I disable Adguard and visit the website in incognito mode, the webpage picture loads. Many pictures work, but sometimes a couple of them do not. This problem occurs on any \"Schale Network\" website. Source of all URLs are here: https://gitgud.io/Schale/schale-network ... I will also attach the Filterling log as comment below if I try to load this picture and its not working.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @sonnyxq\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot

\r\n> This issue concerns the promotion of X’s mobile app appearing when opening an account profile in a browser.\r\n> \r\n> I’ve confirmed reproduction on iOS Safari and Windows Chrome (with the user agent set to `Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_6_2 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/18.6 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1`). \r\n>  Considering the possibility of geo dependency, I tested with IP addresses from the Italy, Japan, and Germany confirmed it reproduces.\r\n> \r\n> In attempting to reproduce this issue using an iPhone, I took care with the following matters:\r\n> I cleared Safari’s cache.\r\n> I ensured no extensions other than AdGuard were enabled.\r\n> I powered off the iPhone and then restarted it.\r\n> In Safari settings, I disabled all content blockers and then re-enabled them.\r\n> After that, I restarted Safari.\r\n> I also restarted AdGuard, and checked for filter updates in AdGuard.

Under \"Contact,\" it shows a U.S. address (123 Fifth Avenue, NY 10160, New York), but his real shop is operated only in Germany, where he lives.

His official shop is at https://montanablack.de/ (currently closed according to him). On the fake site, clicking \"Shop\" or \"Store\" redirects to an external URL (https://teestow.com/product-category/montana-black-merch). Under \"Contact,\" it shows a U.S. address (123 Fifth Avenue, NY 10160, New York), but his real shop is operated only in Germany, where he lives. I have already reported this site to Google Safe Browsing. Maybe you can block it via DNS Filter.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @hArDsTyLe2000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 11`\r\nBrowser: | Firefox","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214771/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-03T19:04:20Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

His official shop is at https://montanablack.de/ (currently closed according to him). On the fake site, clicking \"Shop\" or \"Store\" redirects to an external URL (https://teestow.com/product-category/montana-black-merch). Under \"Contact,\" it shows a U.S. address (123 Fifth Avenue, NY 10160, New York), but his real shop is operated only in Germany, where he lives. I have already reported this site to Google Safe Browsing. Maybe you can block it via DNS Filter.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @hArDsTyLe2000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 11`\r\nBrowser: | Firefox","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214771/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-03T19:04:20Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

His official shop is at https://montanablack.de/ (currently closed according to him). On the fake site, clicking \"Shop\" or \"Store\" redirects to an external URL (https://teestow.com/product-category/montana-black-merch). Under \"Contact,\" it shows a U.S. address (123 Fifth Avenue, NY 10160, New York), but his real shop is operated only in Germany, where he lives. I have already reported this site to Google Safe Browsing. Maybe you can block it via DNS Filter.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @hArDsTyLe2000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 11`\r\nBrowser: | Firefox","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214771/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-03T19:04:20Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

His official shop is at https://montanablack.de/ (currently closed according to him). On the fake site, clicking \"Shop\" or \"Store\" redirects to an external URL (https://teestow.com/product-category/montana-black-merch). Under \"Contact,\" it shows a U.S. address (123 Fifth Avenue, NY 10160, New York), but his real shop is operated only in Germany, where he lives. I have already reported this site to Google Safe Browsing. Maybe you can block it via DNS Filter.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @hArDsTyLe2000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 11`\r\nBrowser: | Firefox","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214771/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-03T19:04:20Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
