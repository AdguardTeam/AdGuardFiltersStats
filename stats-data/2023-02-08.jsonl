I opened it and when I hit \"home\" it opened a new tab, appeared to open a couple of different things before settling on Monster.ca. Sometimes when it happens it take a coupe or clicks with the trackpad before it does something. In all the years I've used AdGuard I've never had an issue it works so well. I've not changed any of the setting. It started doing this a few weeks ago. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/cuvAtBd.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Zedd0HA.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.10\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List\r\nCustom filters: | Easy List\r\nOther extensions used: | AdGuard is amazing. It used to work on the site I stream from https://gomovies.sx until recently. Now it randomly \"freezes\" when you go to click on a button. It takes another click or two for something to happen and then it opens a new tab with random promotions which themselves most often get stopped. This is only happening with GoMovies site. In all the years I've used it this is actually the first issue I've encountered, so thank you!
