Не блокируется Яндекс реклама. Всеми сервисами и поиском Яндекса не пользуюсь. Есть аналоги. Я хочу полностью заблокировать весь Яндекс, кинопоиск, все его сервисы вместе с рекламой. Чтобы всё это не открывалось во всех браузерах. На уровне операционной системы. Штатным фаерволом. У меня Windows 10. С последствиями совершения моих действий согласен. Домены: dzen.ru yandex.ru yastatic.net / Заблокировал IP: 5.255.255.5 5.255.255.50 5.255.255.55 5.255.255.60 62.217.160.2 77.88.55.66 77.88.55.70 77.88.55.77 77.88.55.80 178.154.131.215-178.154.131.217 / Какие ещё домены?
