In the past week, Arkadium games has changed their set up, now offer a Premium subcription for ad free playing.  Thus on the basic free games the ads now run.  Can AdGuard be updated to stop them?  This is NEW.  Arkadium licenses out their games to other sites, including AARP where I also play them.  Various Solitaire games, and Match 3 MahJongg games.  \r\nUsername: `@Freedom2b`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/i07fy03ktj40coo4c8cow48ocs8ko4k9dxqcqc5zw8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/5z7749nmjo084g4oo4ks88gcoc4gsoclqvqzissqr4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.72 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/203603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/203603/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-20T14:13:33Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
