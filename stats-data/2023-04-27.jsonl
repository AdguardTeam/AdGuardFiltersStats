Also, it takes some time before the popup is shown at all.\r\n> \r\n> If Adguard is turned off, there is no lag, and all emojies are shown correctly (with images).\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/UgoklAl.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/fitbLpj.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.12\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>I don't care about cookies<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion, <br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters\r\nOther extensions used: | Grammarly, SponsorBlock for Youtube","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149400/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1524979869","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149400#issuecomment-1524979869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149400","id":1524979869,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85a5Vid","user":{"login":"MaxThrane","id":44277456,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Mjc3NDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44277456?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxThrane","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxThrane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxThrane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxThrane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxThrane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxThrane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxThrane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxThrane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxThrane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxThrane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxThrane/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-27T07:32:48Z","updated_at":"2023-04-27T07:32:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jellizaveta Will you reopen this issue?
