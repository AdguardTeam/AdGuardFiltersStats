Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [http://eksisozluk1923.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Feksisozluk1923.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> eksisozluk1923 and its old versions had a double click problem where you needed to double click every link on the website because the first click would only trigger an ad and nothing would happen. The ad that got triggered had the class \"ad-doubleclickwebinterstital\".\r\n> \r\n> AdGuard Turkish has a rule for this in the TurkishFilter/sections/css_extended.txt file: \r\n> \"eksisozluk1923.com#$?#.ad-doubleclickwebinterstital { remove: true; }\"\r\n> \r\n> This rule has been preventing the double click problem for a while. Now it seems like the website added another element that causes the double click problem, which has the class \"interstitial-close-link-source\".\r\n> \r\n> I can confirm that adding this rule to My Filters fixes the problem:\r\n> \"eksisozluk1923.com#$?#.interstitial-close-link-source { remove: true; }\"\r\n> \r\n> So maybe that could be added alongside the old class rule.

versions had a double click problem where you needed to double click every link on the website because the first click would only trigger an ad and nothing would happen. The ad that got triggered had the class \"ad-doubleclickwebinterstital\".\r\n> \r\n> AdGuard Turkish has a rule for this in the TurkishFilter/sections/css_extended.txt file: \r\n> \"eksisozluk1923.com#$?#.ad-doubleclickwebinterstital { remove: true; }\"\r\n> \r\n> This rule has been preventing the double click problem for a while. Now it seems like the website added another element that causes the double click problem, which has the class \"interstitial-close-link-source\".\r\n> \r\n> I can confirm that adding this rule to My Filters fixes the problem:\r\n> \"eksisozluk1923.com#$?#.interstitial-close-link-source { remove: true; }\"\r\n> \r\n> So maybe that could be added alongside the old class rule.

If I refresh the page, I can begin interacting with the site again until I start to scroll and the website \"dims\" again. Once I turned AdGuard off (added this site to my allow list) and refreshed, it was evident to me that the \"dimming\" effect was the overlay used with the popup in the attached screenshot; however, AdGuard can block the email sign-up pop-up but not the overlay that accompanies it.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/p40zCa7.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.10.1.1277 release\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java, <br>Hide your IP address (208.54.104.184)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/mac_v2/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters\r\nUserscripts: | Web of Trust (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js),<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js),<br>AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nOther extensions used: | I've turned them all off.

Sitenizde tavsiye edilen bütün ayarlamaların doğru olduğuna eminim, ancak hiç bir reklam engellenmiyor. URL olarak verdiğim sadece bir örnek. Bilgisayarımda da AdGuard kullanıyorum. Aynı sitelerdeki reklamları engelliyor, ancak Safari kullanırken AdGuard Mobil versiyonu hiç bir reklamı engellemiyor. Deneme üyeliğim 2 gün sonra bitiyor. Deneme üyeliğim bitmeden sizlerden çözüm beklemekteyim.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/TTOzJjb.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/cjrstYp.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/w18K8uV.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://reports-img.adguard.com/ncDI07E.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://reports-img.adguard.com/BUnIjPp.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.6\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Turkish","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/151524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/151524/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1568254018","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/151524#issuecomment-1568254018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/151524","id":1568254018,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85deahC","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-30T11:18:31Z","updated_at":"2023-05-30T11:18:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@AdguardTeam/filters-maintainers Please take a look.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1568254018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-30T11:18:31Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
