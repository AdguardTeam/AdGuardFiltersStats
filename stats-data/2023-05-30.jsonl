Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [http://eksisozluk1923.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Feksisozluk1923.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> eksisozluk1923 and its old versions had a double click problem where you needed to double click every link on the website because the first click would only trigger an ad and nothing would happen. The ad that got triggered had the class \"ad-doubleclickwebinterstital\".\r\n> \r\n> AdGuard Turkish has a rule for this in the TurkishFilter/sections/css_extended.txt file: \r\n> \"eksisozluk1923.com#$?#.ad-doubleclickwebinterstital { remove: true; }\"\r\n> \r\n> This rule has been preventing the double click problem for a while. Now it seems like the website added another element that causes the double click problem, which has the class \"interstitial-close-link-source\".\r\n> \r\n> I can confirm that adding this rule to My Filters fixes the problem:\r\n> \"eksisozluk1923.com#$?#.interstitial-close-link-source { remove: true; }\"\r\n> \r\n> So maybe that could be added alongside the old class rule.

versions had a double click problem where you needed to double click every link on the website because the first click would only trigger an ad and nothing would happen. The ad that got triggered had the class \"ad-doubleclickwebinterstital\".\r\n> \r\n> AdGuard Turkish has a rule for this in the TurkishFilter/sections/css_extended.txt file: \r\n> \"eksisozluk1923.com#$?#.ad-doubleclickwebinterstital { remove: true; }\"\r\n> \r\n> This rule has been preventing the double click problem for a while. Now it seems like the website added another element that causes the double click problem, which has the class \"interstitial-close-link-source\".\r\n> \r\n> I can confirm that adding this rule to My Filters fixes the problem:\r\n> \"eksisozluk1923.com#$?#.interstitial-close-link-source { remove: true; }\"\r\n> \r\n> So maybe that could be added alongside the old class rule.
