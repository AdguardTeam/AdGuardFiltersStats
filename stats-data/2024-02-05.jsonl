Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://sling.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsling.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> I may not have completed the forms correctly.  I use ASUS app from the Play store to manage my ASUS RT-AC88U router.  I supplied serveral screen images of the ASUS on my Android phone showing Adguard enabled and disabled.  I have several Roku external devices which have serveral apps installed ( Netflix, Spectrum, Prime, AppleTV, and recently added Sling)  All apps work fine when Adguard is enabled except Sling.  When Adguard is disabled all apps on the Roku unit work with no issue.  The Roku model is 4800X, Software Version 12.5.5, Build 4174-C2.  I have another newer Roku unit that has the same issue - if needed I will supplied the details of that unit.  All hardware (Router, Roku units) and Streaming apps are are current support levels.   I hope you can assist with my issue.  \r\nUsername: `@Jim Fulghum`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/cfcc4p1vads8gkc4g8gwwg40w0g0osgpjm855hxqg0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b2z8tjjt5zk88844sc8gc8k04ss4s8cdo3g9a3stso.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8vkmbh4wawgsoc0k0wwocck84skkokg8h8hkxlmcgk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/fx6dyv108s8wc00sk4o8gok4s88848othsmx8g9o80.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/xluu469gxeogsw480swwkk004wwgg89v79g7muu5ko.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/1yhluvfq4ce844co8wcw0cwgs0gg48whw6diu3l07s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nBrowser: | Roku Device","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172202/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1926562897","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172202#issuecomment-1926562897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172202","id":1926562897,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85y1QRR","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-05T09:33:51Z","updated_at":"2024-02-05T09:33:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi.
