Many months ago, it used to cause a long delay to open Steam but back then this filter was not presented as an option in AdGuard for Windows's Add a filter page, so I didn't report back then\n3. But now the filter is present in the list and enabling it causes the Steam app not able to run\n4. Alternate is to either disable the filter or disable the Filter localhost option in Advanced Settings which would make this filter useless anyway\n5. Either it should be fixed if possible, or the filter should be removed from AdGuard for Windows and other affected AdGuard apps.\n2.

Many months ago, it used to cause a long delay to open Steam but back then this filter was not presented as an option in AdGuard for Windows's Add a filter page, so I didn't report back then\n3. But now the filter is present in the list and enabling it causes the Steam app not able to run\n4. Alternate is to either disable the filter or disable the Filter localhost option in Advanced Settings which would make this filter useless anyway\n5. Either it should be fixed if possible, or the filter should be removed from AdGuard for Windows and other affected AdGuard apps.\n2.

Many months ago, it used to cause a long delay to open Steam but back then this filter was not presented as an option in AdGuard for Windows's Add a filter page, so I didn't report back then\n3. But now the filter is present in the list and enabling it causes the Steam app not able to run\n4. Alternate is to either disable the filter or disable the Filter localhost option in Advanced Settings which would make this filter useless anyway\n5. Either it should be fixed if possible, or the filter should be removed from AdGuard for Windows and other affected AdGuard apps.\n2.

Many months ago, it used to cause a long delay to open Steam but back then this filter was not presented as an option in AdGuard for Windows's Add a filter page, so I didn't report back then\n3. But now the filter is present in the list and enabling it causes the Steam app not able to run\n4. Alternate is to either disable the filter or disable the Filter localhost option in Advanced Settings which would make this filter useless anyway\n5. Either it should be fixed if possible, or the filter should be removed from AdGuard for Windows and other affected AdGuard apps.\n2.

Many months ago, it used to cause a long delay to open Steam but back then this filter was not presented as an option in AdGuard for Windows's Add a filter page, so I didn't report back then\n3. But now the filter is present in the list and enabling it causes the Steam app not able to run\n4. Alternate is to either disable the filter or disable the Filter localhost option in Advanced Settings which would make this filter useless anyway\n5. Either it should be fixed if possible, or the filter should be removed from AdGuard for Windows and other affected AdGuard apps.\n2.

Is that not possible? \nLike apply this Lan filter only for browser exes like chrome.exe, firefox.exe, msedge.exe, etc. supported browsers.

Many months ago, it used to cause a long delay to open Steam but back then this filter was not presented as an option in AdGuard for Windows's Add a filter page, so I didn't report back then\n3. But now the filter is present in the list and enabling it causes the Steam app not able to run\n4. Alternate is to either disable the filter or disable the Filter localhost option in Advanced Settings which would make this filter useless anyway\n5. Either it should be fixed if possible, or the filter should be removed from AdGuard for Windows and other affected AdGuard apps.\n2.

Is that not possible? \nLike apply this Lan filter only for browser exes like chrome.exe, firefox.exe, msedge.exe, etc. supported browsers.

Many months ago, it used to cause a long delay to open Steam but back then this filter was not presented as an option in AdGuard for Windows's Add a filter page, so I didn't report back then\n3. But now the filter is present in the list and enabling it causes the Steam app not able to run\n4. Alternate is to either disable the filter or disable the Filter localhost option in Advanced Settings which would make this filter useless anyway\n5. Either it should be fixed if possible, or the filter should be removed from AdGuard for Windows and other affected AdGuard apps.\n2.

Is that not possible? \nLike apply this Lan filter only for browser exes like chrome.exe, firefox.exe, msedge.exe, etc. supported browsers.
