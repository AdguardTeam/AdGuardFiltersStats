For other sites that use cloudflare's security it works perfectly fine when stealth mode is applied to all links straight thru. When $stealth is added to disable it, however, the same loop occurs. I think the \"Hide my email address\" portion of stealth mode is what these sites don't like. I would like a way to FORCE stealth mode or OVERRIDE a $stealth rule written in the AdGuard Base Filter.
