instantly.\r\n> \r\n> I have tried keeping Adguard enabled and disabling all filters but unfortunately, the Plex app does not work. I have to completely disable Adguard to get it to work.\r\n> \r\n> Or If I disable Route traffic through Adguard for Plex it also works.\r\n> \r\n> So it's something in Adguard core that is blocking the Plex app from loading.

We do this when you refresh/move back on the browser on any NetBanking page.\"\r\n> \r\n> I turned off all the browser extensions & enabled them one by one to find out which one was causing this issue, it turns out that the Adguard Chrome browser extension is the one.\r\n> \r\n> Currently, as a workaround, I've added netportal.hdfcbank.com to the allowlist so that in this particular domain adguard remains inactive. \r\n> \r\n> I reported this on Github: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension/issues/2845\r\n> \r\n> & to adguard email team [supportadguard.com] with the same details plus the screen captured video of this issue for better understanding & clarification\r\n> \r\n> ticket ID 916920 was assigned & the email team advised me to contact here, so reporting the same here too. \r\n> \r\n> Pls, fix this ASAP\r\nUsername: `@SM-03 `\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/5j79d99hr5gccws0480o8ckw0sgcs0kb9w7lmwxf20.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/133r1h7oogq8o4okoog8kcg84ccssks9s3zqrbgwvk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.53\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>IndianList</details>\r\nOther extensions used: | ESET installed as AV, no other ad blockers extentions.I already raised this issue via email & the ticket ID is 916920, posting the same here as the email team advised to raise it here.
