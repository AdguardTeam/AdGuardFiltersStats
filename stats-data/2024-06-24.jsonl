instantly.\r\n> \r\n> I have tried keeping Adguard enabled and disabling all filters but unfortunately, the Plex app does not work. I have to completely disable Adguard to get it to work.\r\n> \r\n> Or If I disable Route traffic through Adguard for Plex it also works.\r\n> \r\n> So it's something in Adguard core that is blocking the Plex app from loading.
