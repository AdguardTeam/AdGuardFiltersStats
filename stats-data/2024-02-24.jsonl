It can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \r\n> Saving memory feature of your web browser or sleep feature of your operating system can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n> In this case, please re-enable AdGuard's filtering by toggling the protection toggle.\r\n> Following the instructions can be needed.\r\n\r\n### The instructions\r\n1.
