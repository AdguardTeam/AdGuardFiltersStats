Comment\r\n> All Apple apps are slow on WiFi with AdGuard enabled. The problem persists across all Apple apps and all WiFi networks. The only solution I have found is to disable AdGuard, and I have tried many different solutions. Different WiFi networks, different routers, different ISPs, different router DNS settings, different iPhone DNS settings, nothing helps except disabling AdGuard. I would prefer to keep AdGuard active on wifi if possible, but right now I can’t because it’s just been too much of an inconvenience lately and I’ve had enough. This issue has persisted for multiple years at this point, probably at least since iOS 15.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/n0azac29ji808owk4gcgs0gccgk4w0k13nwl6wp21t.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/l9kzoeexx80s0sokk80cwk0oow00cgkbzsb4t4evk8.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.8\r\nSystem version: | iOS 18.3\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198343/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2650013844","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198343#issuecomment-2650013844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198343","id":2650013844,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86d9ACU","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-11T07:28:42Z","updated_at":"2025-02-11T07:28:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I haven't noticed that on iPhone with our filters or DNS.

The problem persists across all Apple apps and all WiFi networks. The only solution I have found is to disable AdGuard, and I have tried many different solutions. Different WiFi networks, different routers, different ISPs, different router DNS settings, different iPhone DNS settings, nothing helps except disabling AdGuard. I would prefer to keep AdGuard active on wifi if possible, but right now I can’t because it’s just been too much of an inconvenience lately and I’ve had enough. This issue has persisted for multiple years at this point, probably at least since iOS 15.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/n0azac29ji808owk4gcgs0gccgk4w0k13nwl6wp21t.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/l9kzoeexx80s0sokk80cwk0oow00cgkbzsb4t4evk8.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.8\r\nSystem version: | iOS 18.3\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198343/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-02-11T06:56:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> При включении dns защиты и выбора dns сервера adguard-dns.io при поиске в google отображается только первые 10 картинок или видео. Остальные картинки не прогружаются.  Отключение расширенной защиты или защиты safari никак не влияет. Смена dns сервера на любой, отличный от AdGuard решает проблему. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pyrqtj0w2yskkgs48k4oocsw08g8c84f6szttjje1s.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/rczefcb40ys4s48c444sc0os8o8soooprfvh30kbms.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.8\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>AdGuard Experimental, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2650617836","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197689#issuecomment-2650617836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197689","id":2650617836,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86d_Tfs","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-11T12:07:54Z","updated_at":"2025-02-11T12:07:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://google.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgoogle.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> I turn on AdGuard, default settings with everything enable, browser and most apps no longer are able to connect.

рекламы в приложении ВК, мне ответили, что в приложении нет возможности скрыть рекламу, можно пользоваться ВК через браузер, там не будет рекламы. Зашла ВК  через браузер и что?-как была реклама ,так и осталась. Реклама не только в приложении ВК,но и в других приложениях смартфона. Во всех браузерах  реклама выскакивает, на любой странице.

Its been weeks i am reporting it to adguard and they have been no help at all which is really frustrating. \r\nUsername: `@Sakciit`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/aj9oevp8rdsg4sgsck0kkwccw00go0g14cun3c8hri.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ocen7n1xrsgswcggk8wgsgck0sk084cmk99gtx9yis.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6vtlcst5fi0wwcwwk8888owc0okkws82v22k5pdu9c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.8\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets\r\nOther extensions used: | Non","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2651230747","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236#issuecomment-2651230747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236","id":2651230747,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86eBpIb","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-11T15:50:43Z","updated_at":"2025-02-11T15:50:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@sakciit Hi.
