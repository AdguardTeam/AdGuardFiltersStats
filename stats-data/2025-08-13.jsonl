be\n\n```\n||static-tracking.klaviyo.com/onsite/*\n```\nwhich blocks any analytics scripts/API requests/etc that Klaviyo uses for shopper identification.\n\nWe should _not_ be blocking requests to `a.klaviyo.com`. That rule should be removed.\n\n### Additional information\n\nA similar issue was submitted: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210120#issuecomment-3128250521\n\nBut the fix implemented was not the proposed solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-08-13T00:32:06Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
