However each time the reference number is different.  I rely on Sainsburys for my grocery delivery as I am unable to get out much and do not drive.  Any idea how to fix this problem.

I have been able to reproduce this. Mapbox caches aggressively, so if you test AdGuard off first, the map tiles will be cached, thus making it not reproducible. \r\n\r\nThis is related to #98853.\r\n\r\nMapbox allows web developers to limit api keys to a particular referrer: https://docs.mapbox.com/accounts/guides/tokens/#url-restrictions\r\n\r\nThe url being blocked in this case does not include the \"secure\" text in the URL which was included in the fix for #98853.\r\n\r\nRecommend updating the filter at https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/5ff2ace28bd0af68584d482eba7cfae1b1be2709/BaseFilter/sections/allowlist_stealth.txt#L1118 to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@@||api.mapbox.com/*?*&access_token=$stealth=referrer\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes it a bit more open to mapbox api requests that need the referrer, while making the stealth mode more specific to just the referrer that is needed.\r\n\r\nThis also likely eliminates the need for domain specific mapbox stealth disables that are found in https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/BaseFilter/sections/allowlist_stealth.txt","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1872537532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-30T14:25:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
