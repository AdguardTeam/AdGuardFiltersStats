https://accounts.google.com/v3/signin/identifier?continue=https\r\n> disabling Adguard would enable one to login to their Google Account, however, enabling Adguard again afterwards would instantly

assume it's not specific to this one show.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
