https://accounts.google.com/v3/signin/identifier?continue=https\r\n> disabling Adguard would enable one to login to their Google Account, however, enabling Adguard again afterwards would instantly

assume it's not specific to this one show.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

[@soraneoumi](https://github.com/soraneoumi) Ok, could you please test when these modules are turned off?\n\nSorry, I cannot catch what is the modules you said.\nI tried the trouble shooting mode of Firefox(all addon were disabled), but the issue reproduced.\nThen I tried turning off AdGuard's ad filter and Userscripts (other features I did have turned off, and the advanced settings have been restored to the default), neither of which improved it.\n\nSo the summary is as follows: \n1. This issue can only be solved by turning off the main switch of AdGuard for windows/mac. Since Firefox's browser addon doesn't reproduce this issue, it may not be caused by ad filtter rules.\n2.This issue only occurs on Firefox, it may be a bug in Firefox and not AdGuard. Edge and Safari works properly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2780873228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-05T16:01:33Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
