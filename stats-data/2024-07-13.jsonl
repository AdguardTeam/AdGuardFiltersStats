trying to fix an issue where the video player pops up a window prompting users to log in after playing for a few minutes, marked in red. Sometimes, even after the user closes the login window, it reappears after a while. \r\n> \r\n> Requirement 1: I want to be able to resolve the issue where this window doesn't pop up when playing videos, and the video playback isn't paused. \r\n> \r\n> Requirement 2: I need to ensure that the \"Login\" button (the one I've marked with a yellow arrow) functions correctly by popping up the login window and allowing users to log in as expected. \r\n> \r\nUsername: `@test`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/e7vd3e0csvsws4ccsw8ckoo0soock4gl1iffrw8ryo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.64\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2226888951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-13T12:48:32Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

It appears that the filter ||lh.googleusercontent.com^$domain=animevietsub.* in your system is blocking video playback on my site, making it impossible for users to view content.\r\n\r\nThis filter is causing significant disruption to my users' experience and affecting the overall functionality of the website. I kindly request that you review and remove this filter to restore normal operation for our visitors.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n2.
