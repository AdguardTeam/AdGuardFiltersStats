enabled, there is a bar up the top that can’t be selected with AdGuard’s element picker.\r\n> \r\n> When AdGuard is disabled, an ad is shown, which actually covers an area greater than the bar itself,

Моём мире в разделе музыка постоянно появляется всплывающее окно с просьбой отключить Вашу защиту. Проблема возникла после того как я пытался решить другую проблему в Моём мире: полная блокировка звука на всём видео сайта. Я обращался за помощью в службу поддержки моего Яндекс браузера и следовал их инструкциям: загрузить  гугл хром браузер, добавить новый профиль. Проблему так и не решили: надо разбираться с расширениями. Второй браузер и и новый профиль я удалил, они мешают и создают путаницу. После этих манипуляций и возникла проблема в разделе Музыка, хотя там до этого было всё хорошо.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/k9f4mj5vpiosw0w8gsggcwosk8844sooizaq4eha3k.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tpsw3pvqjtwwwkg0sk0g8c88cokowko9ubsl14n6b0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hnhzdsqn0j4s00sc00gksck448wk4gc5q0edcg0ja8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.2.168\r\nBrowser: | Yandex\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>EasyList Thailand","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-25T08:11:09Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

fix the bugs in AdGuard for Safari. When I browse my filters are not always working. I have 2 Mac Books, 1 iPhone and an iPad and a Mac Studio with different Apple IDs and I have the same problems on all devices. All filters are updated every hour and the software is always on the latest version. I saw that someone already reported this page on GitHub, but it can't be reproduced. But why do I get the banner also on my Mac Studio and iPhone? \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/a2a0634a9y8k0wowscwskwkosg8k4w0rl1gfb0ig9w.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.5.0\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German, <br/>EasyList Germany, <br/>Liste FR, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Polish Anti-Annoying Special Supplement, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Serbo-Croatian List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1734343511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-25T19:31:44Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Sprawdziłem szybkość internetu na stronie swojego operatora Multimedia i wyniki okazały się dziwne. Myślałem, że coś jest nie tak z internetem a tu się okazało, że jak wyłączyłem adblokera Adguard, internet nagle odżył co widać po odczytach na screenach. Co ciekawsze, nie przycina całego internetu ale co niektóre strony albo podstrony. Test zrobiony  na innej stronie: https://www.speedtest.pl pokazał także różnicę w testach, szczególnie przy wysyłaniu pakietu. O dziwo ping był  już prawidłowy.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bbo90mfbdgggok44cocs04c8okwogoc18bfu7p1zd9.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/npm2vea47g0ogk00o8wcowk00gg84cka0v3ijeo3kw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/79cdddjt1cgsowgs4c8socokk8ck0sg5omxqvxv2ek.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jc8aw84jsc8w0og8gs08w4gscwk4ocscxp4e7rgq5s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oxh7y5cvh3kcskg80cw8w4k8cg4wco8z9ena1808s0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.2.168\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (60), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nOther extensions used: | Windows 11 z wbudowanym antywirusem, Adblocker Adguard","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162515/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-25T20:27:54Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
