enabled, there is a bar up the top that can’t be selected with AdGuard’s element picker.\r\n> \r\n> When AdGuard is disabled, an ad is shown, which actually covers an area greater than the bar itself,

Моём мире в разделе музыка постоянно появляется всплывающее окно с просьбой отключить Вашу защиту. Проблема возникла после того как я пытался решить другую проблему в Моём мире: полная блокировка звука на всём видео сайта. Я обращался за помощью в службу поддержки моего Яндекс браузера и следовал их инструкциям: загрузить  гугл хром браузер, добавить новый профиль. Проблему так и не решили: надо разбираться с расширениями. Второй браузер и и новый профиль я удалил, они мешают и создают путаницу. После этих манипуляций и возникла проблема в разделе Музыка, хотя там до этого было всё хорошо.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/k9f4mj5vpiosw0w8gsggcwosk8844sooizaq4eha3k.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tpsw3pvqjtwwwkg0sk0g8c88cokowko9ubsl14n6b0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hnhzdsqn0j4s00sc00gksck448wk4gc5q0edcg0ja8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.2.168\r\nBrowser: | Yandex\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>EasyList Thailand","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-25T08:11:09Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
