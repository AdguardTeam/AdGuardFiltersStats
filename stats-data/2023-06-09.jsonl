Однако, на самом деле, когда пользователь самостоятельно переходит в карточку организации, это говорит о том, что ему нужна информация об этой организации. В карточке можно найти различные данные, такие как услуги, акции и другую информацию. Как пользователю, мне важна эта информация, именно то, что AdGuard скрывает, я и хочу увидеть.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9QM4MXl.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/f7oIxPB.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.13.1\r\nBrowser: | Yandex\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://ya.ru/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fya.ru%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | Kaspersky Security Cloud","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/153228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/153228/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-06-09T08:15:16Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
