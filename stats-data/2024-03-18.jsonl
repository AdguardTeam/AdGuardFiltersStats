There is no specific rule in place to hide the ad placeholder. On PC, blocking the script reduces the size to 0, effectively hiding the ad frame. However, on iPhone, the iframe remains visible, which is why it's expected that the ad frame does not disappear. If there are any other reasons contributing to this behavior, please let me know for future reference.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/nbslo16md68owksws8cc8s8s04k4cskkeg8gu3dnrk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2y8g2isy5ayooksk8k484ww0k4wgoo0m8lmqv6c40g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ij6t3ia3ng0sss04wgogk440kss4g4wppgz1oe77v4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://doh.quad9.net/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/ios/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175156/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-18T03:49:30Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
