Comment\r\n> When I try to open certain articles from my Discover feed, I will get one of two things. Either a solid blank white page, or a pop-up telling me that and ad blocker has been detected. Everything automatically opens in Google but if I click the three dots in the upper right hand side of the article and ask to open in chrome, I get the same exact thing. Either the blank white page or the pop-up. It is not every article on the Discover feed but it happens almost every day with multiple articles. This is been going on for about 4 months.\r\nUsername: `@Kjw198`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/9nt7jgucp1wc4o8swcww0wkssssos8of7eovj5nn9s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oql4c5eckdw84wgc4cksk8o8480c0841ven2q1w1kp.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.3.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Eset security ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172739/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1950960567","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172739#issuecomment-1950960567","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172739","id":1950960567,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM850SUu3","user":{"login":"Spok1","id":34476664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDc2NjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34476664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1","html_url":"https://github.com/Spok1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-18T04:44:00Z","updated_at":"2024-02-18T04:44:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Я знаю,однако как еще было отправить рапорт.
