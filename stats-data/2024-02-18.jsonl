Comment\r\n> When I try to open certain articles from my Discover feed, I will get one of two things. Either a solid blank white page, or a pop-up telling me that and ad blocker has been detected. Everything automatically opens in Google but if I click the three dots in the upper right hand side of the article and ask to open in chrome, I get the same exact thing. Either the blank white page or the pop-up. It is not every article on the Discover feed but it happens almost every day with multiple articles. This is been going on for about 4 months.\r\nUsername: `@Kjw198`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/9nt7jgucp1wc4o8swcww0wkssssos8of7eovj5nn9s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oql4c5eckdw84wgc4cksk8o8480c0841ven2q1w1kp.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.3.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Eset security ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172739/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1950960567","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172739#issuecomment-1950960567","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/172739","id":1950960567,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM850SUu3","user":{"login":"Spok1","id":34476664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDc2NjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34476664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1","html_url":"https://github.com/Spok1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spok1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-18T04:44:00Z","updated_at":"2024-02-18T04:44:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Я знаю,однако как еще было отправить рапорт.

I didn't know how to make user rules for this specific problem, so that might still be possible somehow. Nobody wants to have ads on pornhub obviously, so they can't just disable it for pornhub entirely. I also tried disabling it on google itself by the way, but that did not have any effect, still wouldn't open.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pw8qt6yc9pcgs8ok8sc4kksc0sksogko76p56al64g.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mmdr408v4cgwcw8g884s0wc4gc44cw0d7y7sm8pr94.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.13\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 Pro, versie 22H2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>List-KR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1951385711","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050#issuecomment-1951385711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050","id":1951385711,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM850T8hv","user":{"login":"infinity-surfer","id":152352369,"node_id":"U_kgDOCRS2cQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/152352369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/infinity-surfer","html_url":"https://github.com/infinity-surfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/infinity-surfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/infinity-surfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/infinity-surfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/infinity-surfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/infinity-surfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/infinity-surfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/infinity-surfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/infinity-surfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/infinity-surfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-18T17:00:56Z","updated_at":"2024-02-18T17:00:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Only pornhub video links*","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1951385711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-18T17:00:58Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
