I have to completely disable Adguard to get it to work.\r\n> \r\n> Or If I disable Route traffic through Adguard for Plex it also works.\r\n> \r\n> So it's something in Adguard core that is blocking the Plex app from loading.

With the filter enabled, for this report, I get a blank white page instead of content. With the filters off, I get the pop-up that an adblocker has been detected. I didn't retry all the other ticker numbers with the annoyance filters enabled but I did do a few the other day and updated those tickets. They have the same behavior as what I'm experiencing here so I would assume even the untested ones would do the same. These websites are from links from the Google Discover feed.

Just add <code>export HUSKY=0</code> to <code>.config/husky/init.sh</code>.</p>\n<p>I've seen some confusion about this on X, so just a heads-up!</p>\n<h1>Sponsoring</h1>\n<p>Husky is downloaded over 45M times per month and used by ~1.5M projects.
