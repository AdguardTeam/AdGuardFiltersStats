This version switched the <code>--show-toplevel</code> flag with <code>--show-cdup</code>, because on Git installed via MSYS2 the former was returning absolute paths that do not work with Node.js <code>child_process</code>. The new flag returns a path relative to the working directory, avoiding the issue.</p>\n<p>The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to install Git via MSYS2, to ensure better future compatibility; using the default Git binary in the GitHub Actions runner was working correctly even with MSYS2.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/commit/52f6eef9868ccf291b2e81935a25d5b07c10b5a4\"><code>52f6eef</code></a> chore(changeset): release (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/issues/1462\">#1462</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/commit/8d8fe23e157f83d846ed9a06bc7c80cfebe0c706\"><code>8d8fe23</code></a> build: update repository url in package.json</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/commit/f0480f01b24b9f6443a12515d413a7ba4dda3981\"><code>f0480f0</code></a> Revert &quot;chore(changeset): release (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/issues/1461\">#1461</a>)&quot;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/commit/1da81c0995e2247bf9224f440bf3f40479be40b8\"><code>1da81c0</code></a> chore(changeset): release (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/issues/1461\">#1461</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/commit/cc04e0802dffda3d74657b3638b0991ee3245856\"><code>cc04e08</code></a> ci: add required permission for provenance generation</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/commit/fa2dac862670439049b4f9fe277e05ccaac1d16e\"><code>fa2dac8</code></a> Revert &quot;chore(changeset): release (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/issues/1455\">#1455</a>)&quot;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/commit/832598584a22e025eb5721e010f22b9dcf7b4931\"><code>8325985</code></a> chore(changeset): release (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/issues/1455\">#1455</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/commit/92f295ffcff8df62f4c15aee8136ed1795b50b40\"><code>92f295f</code></a> build(deps): update dependencies (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/issues/1460\">#1460</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/commit/5293c0984d07f5f131df40d401b46ff047063f78\"><code>5293c09</code></a> build: generate provenance statements for npm package (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/issues/1459\">#1459</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/commit/f184fffda1ebc31c6c9f95162d58acc47e199012\"><code>f184fff</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/issues/1454\">#1454</a> from Falcion/master</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/compare/v15.2.7...v15.2.8\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=lint-staged&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=15.2.7&new-version=15.2.8)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Версия актуальная текущая 15.12.0. Приложение скачано и установлено и обновляется не из какого-то магазина приложений а в виде apk-файла непосредственно с сайта банка. Если AdGuard включен то в настройках в приложении банка в разделе настроек Оформление->Заставки на входе полностью или частично не загружается графика, невозможно выбрать и установить другой набор заставок отличный от того что уже до этого был установлен по умолчанию или выбран пользователем. Наглядно на скриншотах. А если зайти ещё чуть глубже в настройки, т.е. попытаться выбрать конкретный набор заставок чтобы его установить, то там вообще белый экран будет, т.е. не будет показана графика этого набора заставок и не будет кнопки для его загрузки и установки.

Версия актуальная текущая 15.12.0. Приложение скачано и установлено и обновляется не из какого-то магазина приложений а в виде apk-файла непосредственно с сайта банка. Если AdGuard включен то в настройках в приложении банка в разделе настроек Оформление->Заставки на входе полностью или частично не загружается графика, невозможно выбрать и установить другой набор заставок отличный от того что уже до этого был установлен по умолчанию или выбран пользователем. Наглядно на скриншотах. А если зайти ещё чуть глубже в настройки, т.е. попытаться выбрать конкретный набор заставок чтобы его установить, то там вообще белый экран будет, т.е. не будет показана графика этого набора заставок и не будет кнопки для его загрузки и установки. Если AdGuard временно выключить то всё в этом плане в приложении Сбербанка загружается и работает нормально.\r\nUsername: `@NUser2018`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2rm5ucnk9omcoosc48ksgk0w88w8ww47afuvkoauq0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/gon2kglnbfkgw0cgo0sc44o8k4o4k4on8i4568epz4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.6.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Официальное мобильное приложение СберБанка\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.google/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-13T14:33:41Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
