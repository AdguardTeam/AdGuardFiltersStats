This PR blocks it.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### To avoid invalid pull requests, please check and confirm following terms\r\n\r\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report;\r\n- [x] My code follows the [guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [x] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [ ] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\n\r\nThis script from Qidian consumes user's CPU and appears to provide no actual functionality. This slows down the user's browser. I suspect that this script is either a mining script or an anti-ad blocker measure.\r\n\r\n### Enter the issue address\r\n\r\n[#178228](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178228)\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\n#### If possible, a screenshot of a page or application should not be cropped too much. Otherwise, it is not always clear where the element is located\r\n\r\nThis can be confirmed both on Firefox and Chromium. Blocking this script does not affect website functionality. I tested the basic login and reading (this is a novel website) functions, and everything seems to be working fine.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Screenshot 1:</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/29907700/c8efc467-80e1-4f8a-9810-e100f9975b72)\r\n\r\nThe script is obfuscated and makes a large number of recursive function calls. This can be confirmed using the browser's performance profiler.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not

They were automatically\r\nlisted in my report.\r\n\r\nBut the problem I experience is quite general: It seems that Agguard\r\ninterferes with websites even if it is turned off at a specific page. For\r\ninstance, I cannot log into my health provider with password, until I\r\neither disable the Agguard addon, or do incognito mode. And with Zotero it\r\nhappens with different publications. It seems that turning off for a\r\nwebsite still leaves AdGuard enough controle to block.\r\n\r\nThank you for your interest in that.

The ad blocker ad isn’t working anymore Outside of the VPN that’s the only thing that’s working. I have a page Prescription what to do and trying to get a hold of Support is almost impossible now because one of the things they said I need to do is update my AdGuard when I updated it, everything changed and Support doesn’t work properly so the only thing I can do is try and email them and so far they just keep telling me to do the URL and all the weird stuff that is now come up since I upgraded my AdGuard . \r\nUsername: `@Bob`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ho9uoshrxf4so88o4c8c4c4kk04kg40noch62lz88g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Verizon`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection\r\nOther extensions used: | Norton, as far as I know there could be more.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/177787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/177787/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2085295133","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/177787#issuecomment-2085295133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/177787","id":2085295133,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM858SxQd","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-30T13:09:02Z","updated_at":"2024-04-30T13:09:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please try to disable-enable content blockers in Safari settings and restart Safari, and check for filters update.\r\nDo not close AdGuard window ~90 seconds, because iOS will breaks configuration process.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2085295133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-30T13:09:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

15 Pro that AdGuard used to block all the pop-ups and ads it doesn’t anymore. I’ve done everything their websites suggested and fixed everything and that I was supposed to fix. Nothing seems to work. The ad blocker ad isn’t working anymore Outside of the VPN that’s the only thing that’s working. I have a page Prescription what to do and trying to get a hold of Support is almost impossible now because one of the things they said I need to do is update my AdGuard when I updated it, everything changed and Support doesn’t work properly so the only thing I can do is try and email them and so far they just keep telling me to do the URL and all the weird stuff that is now come up since I upgraded my AdGuard . \r\nUsername: `@Bob`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ho9uoshrxf4so88o4c8c4c4kk04kg40noch62lz88g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Verizon`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection\r\nOther extensions used: | Norton, as far as I know there could be more.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/177787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/177787/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-30T13:09:03Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
