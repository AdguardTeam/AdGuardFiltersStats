Comment\r\n> Starting last week or so, Publishers Clearing House page auto-progression is broken with AdGuard turned on. Previously, having it on would block all ads and just cause the page to auto-progress (submitting your entry). Now it refuses to leave the page seen in the screenshots. All tested browsers with AdGuard on cause this problem. Turning it off in Opera assaults you with ads (and fixes the progression block), but turning it off in Safari doesn’t actually disable it. For whatever reason. Anyway, it’s a problem with the page not being fed the correct information to trick it into thinking “oh, he watched the ad; now I go to the next page.”\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qs89lb4p94gsk0c4ck00wcso4k44kg8lw77h9qnnj4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qqexu7jhqv4wsckgsk8ckkc80wgkcccjujob9rb4hc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.20\r\nSystem version: | MacOS 15.3.1\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201751/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-04T11:22:26Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

(v4.8) running with the basic ad blocking, tracker blocker, and AdGuard default DNS protection enabled (and no custom user rules active) the PBS Android TV app is unable to play videos due to the pre-video advertisement being blocked not allowing the video the play. If I disable protection for the PBS app within AdGuard's settings, video playback works as expected.\n\n\n\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201475/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2779124734","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201475#issuecomment-2779124734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201475","id":2779124734,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86lphP-","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-04T15:39:33Z","updated_at":"2025-04-04T15:39:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@endocrine7132 AdGuard for Android TV does not have even the filtering log.\nCould you please test without the Base filter?
