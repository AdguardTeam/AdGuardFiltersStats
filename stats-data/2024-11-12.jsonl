When clicking \"preview\", it works, and when applying the user rule, it works on the currently loaded site, but when reloading, the filter seems to get ignored. At least, the picture reappears despite the user rule. Maybe, it is somehow added dynamically, I have no idea. Other user rules on inoreader.com work normally, just not this one.
