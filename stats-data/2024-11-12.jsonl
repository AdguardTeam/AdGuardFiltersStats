When clicking \"preview\", it works, and when applying the user rule, it works on the currently loaded site, but when reloading, the filter seems to get ignored. At least, the picture reappears despite the user rule. Maybe, it is somehow added dynamically, I have no idea. Other user rules on inoreader.com work normally, just not this one.

However, please instead replace all entries (many files) from `6play.fr` to `m6.fr`.\r\n\r\n**Context:** The name of the [M6 Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupe_M6) TV replay platform has gone from **6play** to **M6+** for a long time already (many months, see [Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/M6%2B)) but it is only very recently that they have transitioned from `6play.fr` to `m6.fr`. \r\nAt first glance, all rules _(including the optimal JavaScript one for AdGuard products, although scriptlet rules work on their own)_ should continue to operate identically therefore. Just test beforehand if you want to be sure, though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2470835069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-12T15:26:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
