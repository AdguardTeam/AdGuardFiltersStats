The only consistent problem I have with AdGuard on Safari is with CNN, especially CNN videos. When I watch a video on CNN using Safari, 75% of the time, an ad will play prior to the video. And because I hate ads, I don't watch the video. This does not happen when watching CNN videos using Chrome. No ads. Obviously, the easy fix is to only use Chrome when on the CNN website, but there are advantages to using Safari on almost every other site, as I'm a Mac user.
