The only consistent problem I have with AdGuard on Safari is with CNN, especially CNN videos. When I watch a video on CNN using Safari, 75% of the time, an ad will play prior to the video. And because I hate ads, I don't watch the video. This does not happen when watching CNN videos using Chrome. No ads. Obviously, the easy fix is to only use Chrome when on the CNN website, but there are advantages to using Safari on almost every other site, as I'm a Mac user.

A contributor @SeriousHoax brought my attention to this in response to my [tweet](https://twitter.com/Yuki27183/status/1626935791778922497) explaining uBO blocks 99 % of Lucky visitor scam by the rule. I could easily find issues which could have been blocked as the example above, and can say Browsing Security rarely blocks them. The rule has been in uBO badware and DandelionSprout's Anti-Malware list for years now with occasional adjustment and there was only one false positive due to too rough regex in the very early version. I omitted URL as nowadays their life becomes shorter and shorter - the link in the tweet got blocked by GSB few hours later of the tweet but at the time was already dead.

Prerequisites\n\n- [X] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [X] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [X] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nThere was a recent discovery into a new cryptojacking campaign by Cado Labs which identifies a range of new mining pools to add to the AdGuard Base filter cryptominers filter.\r\n\r\nA custom XMRig configuration is written to disk, which registers the miner with the following mining pools:\r\n\r\nxmr.pool.gntl.co.uk\r\npool.hashvault.pro\r\nxmr-eu1.nanopool.org\r\nmonerohash.com\r\npool.supportxmr.com\r\nca.monero.herominers.com\r\nxmrpool.eu\r\npool.xmrfast.com\r\npool.xmr.pt\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nBlock the above in the AdGuard Base cryptominers filter.\n\n### Additional

Prerequisites\n\n- [X] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [X] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [X] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nThere was a recent discovery into a new cryptojacking campaign by Cado Labs which identifies a range of new mining pools to add to the AdGuard Base filter cryptominers filter.\r\n\r\nA custom XMRig configuration is written to disk, which registers the miner with the following mining pools:\r\n\r\nxmr.pool.gntl.co.uk\r\npool.hashvault.pro\r\nxmr-eu1.nanopool.org\r\nmonerohash.com\r\npool.supportxmr.com\r\nca.monero.herominers.com\r\nxmrpool.eu\r\npool.xmrfast.com\r\npool.xmr.pt\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nBlock the above in the AdGuard Base cryptominers filter.\n\n### Additional
