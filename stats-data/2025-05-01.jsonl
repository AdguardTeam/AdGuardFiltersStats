Comment\r\n>  Lately I have noticed that in Google Chrome that my location is shown as West Yorkshire (from my API) at the bottom of the search page, when in fact I am in Hertfordshire. The only way I can get it to show my actual location (from my device) is by disabling Ad Blocking in Adguard, but this obviously defeats the object of Adguard. I have Block Location API disabled in Tracking Protection. Please could you tell me what setting to change to get my location shown correctly in Chrome, without having to disable Ad Blocking. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/t71qbr6wxzk8ogw0ow8g44sk8k8k4kwixbgxu3xytw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/lx0j2nemdz44480c0co0ocs8g0cwoog53bie4rm7c0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.2 (4988)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 6.3.9600.0\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`, `User rules (url: none)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Estonian List, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>IndianList\r\nCustom filters: | User rules (url: none)\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js)<br>AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Avast One, Adguard Browser Assistant, Auto Refresh Plus, Autofill, Google Docs Offline, I Don't Care About Cookies.\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.custom_bootstrap=&dns.custom_fallback=&dns.custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_mode=System&dns.filters=1&dns.servers=System&dns.timeout=0&extensions=AdGuard%2520Assistant%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fassistant%2F4.3%2Fassistant.user.js%29%2CAdGuard%2520Extra%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29%2CAdGuard%2520Popup%2520Blocker%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fpopup-blocker%2F2.5%2Fpopupblocker.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=2.3.9.17.105.120.216.218.224.238.253&license_type=paid&product_type=Win&product_version=7.20.2+%284988%29&referrer=&scheme_version=2&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_third_party_auth=false&stealth.block_trackers=true&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=false&stealth.disable_wap_push_message_routing_service=false&stealth.disable_windows_defender=false&stealth.disable_windows_telemetry=true&stealth.dpi=false&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.flash=false&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.java=false&stealth.location=false&stealth.push=false&stealth.strip_url=true&stealth.third_party_cookies=180&stealth.turn_off_advertising_id=true&stealth.webrtc=false&stealth.x_client=true&system_version=Microsoft+Windows+NT+6.3.9600.0&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F109.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&win.wfp=true)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/203781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/203781/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-01T07:18:11Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
