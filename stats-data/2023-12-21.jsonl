Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [http://www.zhihu.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zhihu.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> 无法在www.zhihu.com网站上正常运行，能够在其他网站上生效。\r\n> 已经尝试过以下方法：\r\n> 1. 重置Adguard设置，完全重装Adguard。\r\n> 2. 清空Safari浏览器缓存和Mac网络缓存\r\n> 3. 关闭Adgurad尝试了其他过滤插件，其他插件能在www.zhihu.com上正常运行。\r\n> 推测：某一次关闭了adguard之后，再次打开时，设置未能生效。我想知道，adguard是否在PC的其他位置中缓存了配置文件。\r\nUsername: `@MrStrangerYang`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot

Instead of uploading a screenshot of this with AdGuard disabled (pointless) I uploaded a screenshot of the $stealth filter rule from AdGuard Base Filter that's causing this.\r\n> \r\n> When stealth mode is enabled this website fails the security check because it loops from one address that's protected by stealth mode to one with stealth mode disabled by the AdGuard Base Filter filtering rule pictured.\r\n> \r\n> Personally, I would like a way to reverse this rule for this or all such websites so I don't have to temporarily disable stealth mode or disable it for only such sites. For other sites that use cloudflare's security it works perfectly fine when stealth mode is applied to all links straight thru. When $stealth is added to disable it, however, the same loop occurs. I think the \"Hide my email address\" portion of stealth mode is what these sites don't like. I would like a way to FORCE stealth mode or OVERRIDE a $stealth rule written in the AdGuard Base Filter. Thank you. Not sure if my username belownis correct or not.

Instead of uploading a screenshot of this with AdGuard disabled (pointless) I uploaded a screenshot of the $stealth filter rule from AdGuard Base Filter that's causing this.\r\n> \r\n> When stealth mode is enabled this website fails the security check because it loops from one address that's protected by stealth mode to one with stealth mode disabled by the AdGuard Base Filter filtering rule pictured.\r\n> \r\n> Personally, I would like a way to reverse this rule for this or all such websites so I don't have to temporarily disable stealth mode or disable it for only such sites. For other sites that use cloudflare's security it works perfectly fine when stealth mode is applied to all links straight thru. When $stealth is added to disable it, however, the same loop occurs. I think the \"Hide my email address\" portion of stealth mode is what these sites don't like. I would like a way to FORCE stealth mode or OVERRIDE a $stealth rule written in the AdGuard Base Filter.

Comment\r\n> Playing video on Crunchyroll is currently not possible unless Adguard is paused (not just disabled).  Just disabling Adguard does not fix the problem.  While Adguard is not paused, video playback will not start.   It will show the loading spinner and never start.  This is somewhat ironic since I pay for the service and won't receive ads even without Adguard.   Disabling Adguard does not fix the problem.\r\n> \r\n> Note:  The \"with Adguard disabled\" pic isn't right for two reasons:\r\n> 1) You can't screenshot the copyrighted video on Windows, so it shows as black.  There is actually a video playing\r\n> 2) Adguard isn't just disabled, it's paused.   Disabling still doesn't work.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qo9vb0zh3s0kw0gkkwc8kkg84c0c448c9ikdydytb4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8k9sl8xi0n8k8swso004oo404o0cg006qvr6n25p6g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.2.240\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nStealth mode options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880)\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR\r\nOther extensions used: | LastPass","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/168776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/168776/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1866791948","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/168776#issuecomment-1866791948","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/168776","id":1866791948,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85vRPwM","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-21T18:56:35Z","updated_at":"2023-12-21T18:56:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://www.crunchyroll.com/de/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crunchyroll.com%2Fde%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Kann bei Crunchyroll keinerlei Serien schauen, wenn der Adguard Schutz aktiv ist.
