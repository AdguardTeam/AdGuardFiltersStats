Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [http://www.zhihu.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zhihu.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> 无法在www.zhihu.com网站上正常运行，能够在其他网站上生效。\r\n> 已经尝试过以下方法：\r\n> 1. 重置Adguard设置，完全重装Adguard。\r\n> 2. 清空Safari浏览器缓存和Mac网络缓存\r\n> 3. 关闭Adgurad尝试了其他过滤插件，其他插件能在www.zhihu.com上正常运行。\r\n> 推测：某一次关闭了adguard之后，再次打开时，设置未能生效。我想知道，adguard是否在PC的其他位置中缓存了配置文件。\r\nUsername: `@MrStrangerYang`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot
