When I load the video playback page, the https://www.linkedin.com/li/track URL is blocked.

was https://krze.klrqqylrzzzj.top/kzzeenqvnqjww/abqaj\r\n\r\nthe only connection both url have is the .top/abqaj everything else is different.\r\n\r\nAnd no matter which one i block of these rules ||zwmvyzyrlvzew.top^$important  klrqqylrzzzj.top^$important   ||qnlranvabrnq.top^$important\r\n\r\nA new one just gets added into the head meta tag section of the html making the rule no longer apply\r\n\r\nI need help please!!!!\r\n3.

Sorry for the long reply. If you check only with the AdGuard extension, does the issue persist? Have you always had desktop AdGuard enabled at checkout?\r\n\r\nSame issue with extension alone and ADG desktop alone. I'm not running both at the same time. I just mentioned ADG desktop since it has an option to capture HAR file. I can capture it via ADG desktop if that would help you to find the problem. But I don't know where ADG desktop would save the file.
