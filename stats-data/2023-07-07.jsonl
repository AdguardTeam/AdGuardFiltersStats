Comment\r\nUsername: `@ayninen`\r\n> When Tampermonkey is installed, everything else seems to work fine, but simple clicking of Google search links won't do anything. Right click works and there you can open te result in a new tab or window. This occurs even if Tampermonkey is disabled from its settings. I have no user scripts for Google. If I turn Tampermonkey off from Safari settings Google works just fine, likewise if I disable Adguard, Google works just fine. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/t7jugac1ias48kg4c4o8cw0ww80ok8s8v186xlewq8.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/qawo3llwzsgowkcgs0kk0kk88c08gw0r5t8cqdhpyo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.11.0.1292 release\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Adblock List for Finland\r\nUserscripts: | Web of Trust (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js),<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js),<br>AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.google.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | Tampermonkey ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1624738749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-07T04:54:22Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
