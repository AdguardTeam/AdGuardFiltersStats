Porn and warez sites also illegal in some countries, but we do not block them. @Eugene-Savenko Please take a look.\r\n\r\nHello to all administrators and members of the Adguard Team. I would like to introduce myself as one of the certified authors of the reported website. The project I have been working on in the community involves creating iOS system shortcuts, which are completely free for users to utilize. The individual who reported us is simply someone who intentionally spreads false information about others, and there have been numerous similar cases in the past. Within our community, this reporter has already gained a notorious reputation. Please feel free to conduct a thorough investigation. It is important to note that the reported website is fully compliant with Chinese laws and regulations, and it has undergone the necessary registration procedures. Through my investigation, I have discovered that the person behind the report is a primary school student, just over ten years old. I kindly request you to examine the matter carefully. Thank you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1560708036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-24T08:50:21Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I would like to introduce myself as one of the certified authors of the reported website. The project I have been working on in the community involves creating iOS system shortcuts, which are completely free for users to utilize. The individual who reported us is simply someone who intentionally spreads false information about others, and there have been numerous similar cases in the past. Within our community, this reporter has already gained a notorious reputation. Please feel free to conduct a thorough investigation. It is important to note that the reported website is fully compliant with Chinese laws and regulations, and it has undergone the necessary registration procedures. Through my investigation, I have discovered that the person behind the report is a primary school student, just over ten years old. I kindly request you to examine the matter carefully. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1560707513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-24T08:49:58Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Sitenizde tavsiye edilen bütün ayarlamaların doğru olduğuna eminim, ancak hiç bir reklam engellenmiyor. URL olarak verdiğim sadece bir örnek. Bilgisayarımda da AdGuard kullanıyorum. Aynı sitelerdeki reklamları engelliyor, ancak Safari kullanırken AdGuard Mobil versiyonu hiç bir reklamı engellemiyor. Deneme üyeliğim 2 gün sonra bitiyor. Deneme üyeliğim bitmeden sizlerden çözüm beklemekteyim.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/TTOzJjb.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/cjrstYp.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/w18K8uV.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://reports-img.adguard.com/ncDI07E.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://reports-img.adguard.com/BUnIjPp.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.6\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Turkish","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/151524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/151524/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-24T10:24:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @szolnok7\r\n> 4-5 gün önce AgGuard mobil deneme üyeliğini başlattım. Sitenizde tavsiye edilen bütün ayarlamaların doğru olduğuna eminim, ancak hiç bir reklam engellenmiyor. URL olarak verdiğim sadece bir örnek. Bilgisayarımda da AdGuard kullanıyorum. Aynı sitelerdeki reklamları engelliyor, ancak Safari kullanırken AdGuard Mobil versiyonu hiç bir reklamı engellemiyor. Deneme üyeliğim 2 gün sonra bitiyor. Deneme üyeliğim bitmeden sizlerden çözüm beklemekteyim.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/TTOzJjb.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/cjrstYp.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/w18K8uV.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://reports-img.adguard.com/ncDI07E.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://reports-img.adguard.com/BUnIjPp.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.6\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Turkish","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/151524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/151524/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1560851459","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/151524#issuecomment-1560851459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/151524","id":1560851459,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85dCLQD","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-24T10:22:46Z","updated_at":"2023-05-24T10:22:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@szolnok7 Please enable AdGuard's extension and content blocker in Safari settings.\r\nNavigate to iOS settings -> Safari -> Extension","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1560851459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-24T10:22:46Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
