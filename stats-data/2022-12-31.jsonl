I fixed static ip for rasberry pi on my router.\r\n> \r\n> AdGuard used to work fine responding with 0.0.0.0 to ads. But after some time (days) it stopped working. I was  trying to figure out if this was something I did but I rerolled my system settings and even reinstalled my AdGuard on Rasberry pi but to no use it stopped blocking all ads either uTube or others.\r\n> \r\n> I tried edge and chrome and same thing happens. I find it interesting that after installing AdGuard on my PC which uses AdGuard Basic Filter if I am not mistaken ads are now blocked.\r\n> \r\n> This however is not what truly want I would like to block ads for my whole LAN and since it worked before there must be something wrong. If you need any further info I will provide. Also I would like to know if I can add this basic filter to my AdGuard Home that would probably block ads on all devices on my LAN but again it should work without this like it  has before.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you and best regards,\r\n> \r\n> Maj\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/u03ci0D.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/5v6rwjr.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | AdGuard Home\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nFilters: | <b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nOther extensions used: | I have no extensions except Google Docs Offline, no antivirus software just windows firewall, no adblockers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/138814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/138814/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-12-31T11:54:41Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
