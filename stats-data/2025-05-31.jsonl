Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://open.spotify.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> When I try to play a song, Spotify skips through the playlist continuously until it lands on certain songs, where it stops—but still doesn’t play. Disabling AdGuard is the only thing that fixes the issue. The same problem also occurs on the Spotify web player, the desktop app downloaded from Spotify’s website, and the version from the Microsoft Store.\r\nUsername: `@DumpoJerome`\r\n\r\n###
