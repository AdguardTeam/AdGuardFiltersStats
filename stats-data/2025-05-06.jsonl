Pinterest, initially a few pins and blank spots where ads appear are there. That's normal. But after a little bit of scrolling, everything disappears. Pins don't pop up anymore and occasionally I'll see outlines or pins trying to load as I scroll but ultimately nothing appears. This does seem to happen on the page recommending all types of pins instead of pages recommending pins for specific boards.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/eus80d1lhqg4kk0cw48ccosswkgcokks2mqyuy2ddw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/20bq86h0f3hcck8wwg88kcoss4g44w0i3fhssmvvdw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/dh1zrjbgy5cks0wookssosk88cw4848cbdi0d9m0bk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.0.230 MV3\r\nSystem version: | Chromium OS 14541.0.0\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard French\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Beyond 20","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204481/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2853373795","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204481#issuecomment-2853373795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204481","id":2853373795,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86qEwdj","user":{"login":"Sergey-Lyapin","id":18536328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM2MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18536328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin","html_url":"https://github.com/Sergey-Lyapin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-06T06:04:54Z","updated_at":"2025-05-06T06:04:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Unfortunately, we cannot reproduce the issue with your settings.\n\nPlease try checking the filters updates, maybe it was already solved.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://www.pinterest.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> When I open Pinterest, initially a few pins and blank spots where ads appear are there. That's normal. But after a little bit of scrolling, everything disappears. Pins don't pop up anymore and occasionally I'll see outlines or pins trying to load as I scroll but ultimately nothing appears. This does seem to happen on the page recommending all types of pins instead of pages recommending pins for specific boards.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/eus80d1lhqg4kk0cw48ccosswkgcokks2mqyuy2ddw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/20bq86h0f3hcck8wwg88kcoss4g44w0i3fhssmvvdw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/dh1zrjbgy5cks0wookssosk88cw4848cbdi0d9m0bk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.0.230 MV3\r\nSystem version: | Chromium OS 14541.0.0\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard French\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Beyond 20","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204481/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-06T06:04:54Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

phishing issue. Saw a cookie bot on Adguard Pro and did not block the cookie bot. Had been dealing with phishing 5-6 years ago. Had changed phone number, changed SIM card, had changed iPhone.

And did not block the cookie bot. \r\n> \r\n> Says clearing history, web data and clearing third party cookies helps reduce phishing.

phishing issue. Saw a cookie bot on Adguard Pro and did not block the cookie bot. Had been dealing with phishing 5-6 years ago. Had changed phone number, changed SIM card, had changed iPhone. The hacker keeps using a cookie bot phishing my device for 6 years. \r\n> \r\n> I keep looking at Adguard pro reports daily basis and saw a cookie bot in the history. And did not block the cookie bot. \r\n> \r\n> Says clearing history, web data and clearing third party cookies helps reduce phishing.
