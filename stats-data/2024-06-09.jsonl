That's the screenshot I've included\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tjtnuowxrr4484gwwsg4gcokg40s0wk1usta63aou7.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.4.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Eset security ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/181112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/181112/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-09T00:28:08Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
