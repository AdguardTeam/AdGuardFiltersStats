My devices are connected to the secondary router. I will check my secondary router if it is configured with the correct DNS settings, but I think it is. And even if it wasn't configured, that shouldn't affect AdGaurd home's function from blocking the ads correct?\r\n> \r\n> Any ideas of what I am doing wrong?
