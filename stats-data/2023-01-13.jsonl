am running AdGaurd home on a Raspberry Pi on my home network. \r\n> \r\n> It should be throwing every ad url into a sinkhole (0.0.0.0), but instead I am still getting ads for sites like Youtube, (and maybe some others, but mostly Youtube).\r\n> \r\n> I'm trying to figure out what I am doing wrong. How do I block Youtube ads? Btw this is the Youtube site, not the mobile app. I suspect Youtube may be trying to stream the ad through the IP:Port that is working for me, so I know it is a constant battle to block them.\r\n> \r\n> If all the data from the internet is running through my Adblock DNS (which I configured on my router) before it gets to my router, than it should be working properly. \r\n> \r\n> Also my home network is using two routers: 1) which connects to the internet and 2) a secondary router that connects to the first one via WDS. My devices are connected to the secondary router. I will check my secondary router if it is configured with the correct DNS settings, but I think it is. And even if it wasn't configured, that shouldn't affect AdGaurd home's function from blocking the ads correct?\r\n> \r\n> Any ideas of what I am doing wrong?

am running AdGaurd home on a Raspberry Pi on my home network. \r\n> \r\n> It should be throwing every ad url into a sinkhole (0.0.0.0), but instead I am still getting ads for sites like Youtube, (and

How do I block Youtube ads? Btw this is the Youtube site, not the mobile app. I suspect Youtube may be trying to stream the ad through the IP:Port that is working for me, so I know it is a constant battle to block them.\r\n> \r\n> If all the data from the internet is running through my Adblock DNS (which I configured on my router) before it gets to my router, than it should be working properly. \r\n> \r\n> Also my home network is using two routers: 1) which connects to the internet and 2) a secondary router that connects to the first one via WDS. My devices are connected to the secondary router. I will check my secondary router if it is configured with the correct DNS settings, but I think it is. And even if it wasn't configured, that shouldn't affect AdGaurd home's function from blocking the ads correct?\r\n> \r\n> Any ideas of what I am doing wrong?

My devices are connected to the secondary router. I will check my secondary router if it is configured with the correct DNS settings, but I think it is. And even if it wasn't configured, that shouldn't affect AdGaurd home's function from blocking the ads correct?\r\n> \r\n> Any ideas of what I am doing wrong?

am running AdGaurd home on a Raspberry Pi on my home network. \r\n> \r\n> It should be throwing every ad url into a sinkhole (0.0.0.0), but instead I am still getting ads for sites like Youtube, (and maybe some others, but mostly Youtube).\r\n> \r\n> I'm trying to figure out what I am doing wrong. How do I block Youtube ads? Btw this is the Youtube site, not the mobile app. I suspect Youtube may be trying to stream the ad through the IP:Port that is working for me, so I know it is a constant battle to block them.\r\n> \r\n> If all the data from the internet is running through my Adblock DNS (which I configured on my router) before it gets to my router, than it should be working properly. \r\n> \r\n> Also my home network is using two routers: 1) which connects to the internet and 2) a secondary router that connects to the first one via WDS. My devices are connected to the secondary router. I will check my secondary router if it is configured with the correct DNS settings, but I think it is. And even if it wasn't configured, that shouldn't affect AdGaurd home's function from blocking the ads correct?\r\n> \r\n> Any ideas of what I am doing wrong?
