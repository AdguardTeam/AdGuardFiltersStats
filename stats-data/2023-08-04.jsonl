Facebook is using friend posts as ransom to force its users to disable adblocker on their site, personally that's fine I can live without my friends posts here and there as if I actually want to see my friends posts I generally go to their page anyways, but it would be nice to get rid of this annoying popup on Facebook so I don't have to constantly have it thrown in my face by Facebook.

Comment\r\nUsername: @herrblitzkrieg\r\n> Captcha is persisting as long as protection is online but disappears when I turn off protection.\r\n> \r\n> Steps to reproduce:\r\n> 1. Open https://yandex.com.\r\n> 2. Search any term (e.g. 'test').\r\n> 3. Yandex SmartCaptcha appears and persists no matter how many times I solve it.\r\n> \r\n> Note that this happens since I started using Yandex search more often.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ntqd7xnkyqoks8sks4g8w0s4k00ks0kgwr3s8kplrc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/e91yat0gofkscgosgossckw4o00skws1xamc23xqfi.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.14\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `sdns://AQMAAAAAAAAAEjk0LjE0MC4xNC4xNDA6NTQ0MyC16ETWuDo-PhJo62gfvqcN48X6aNvWiBQdvy7AZrLa-iUyLmRuc2NyeXB0LnVuZmlsdGVyZWQubnMxLmFkZ3VhcmQuY29t`<br>filters: `User rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>ABPindo, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>Polish Annoyances Filters, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>IndianList, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch</details>\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js,<br>https://adsbypasser.github.io/releases/adsbypasser.lite.es7.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158163/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-04T08:40:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
