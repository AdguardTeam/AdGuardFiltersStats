Facebook is using friend posts as ransom to force its users to disable adblocker on their site, personally that's fine I can live without my friends posts here and there as if I actually want to see my friends posts I generally go to their page anyways, but it would be nice to get rid of this annoying popup on Facebook so I don't have to constantly have it thrown in my face by Facebook.
