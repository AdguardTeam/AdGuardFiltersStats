I have tried reloading and ads show up. When I have tried reloading other videos such as Introducing LEGO Braille Bricks – Play with Braille by Lego official, and the official audio for The Wrong Girl (Greatest Hits Version) by Lee Ann Womack Official the ads are not there. This seems to be contained to this specific video.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ghclp6szi9s0c8woscogs0w80og0ggsds7aguah22o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tfx68g4v7tw4wkkg0g0s44go0o88sc4dmcps04vezs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nOther extensions used: | Duck Duck Go Privacy Essentials, Return Youtube Disklike Button, Youtube-shorts block, CustomTube, and Replace Youtube's Home with Subscriptions","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1703757255","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932#issuecomment-1703757255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932","id":1703757255,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85ljUXH","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-02T07:52:20Z","updated_at":"2023-09-02T07:52:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2kRxZr6b9s](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DV2kRxZr6b9s)\r\n### Comment\r\n> I entered youtube (weirdly downloads thumbnails of videos on page and other layout), I click on a video at top.
