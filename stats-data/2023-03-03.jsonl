@AdamWr,\r\n\r\nThanks for the quick fix! Especially considering I currently don't have a valid French proxy for the very-restricted 6play. Only a French VPS + AdGuard VPN sub.\r\n\r\nAnd, while it shares 99% of the code with _rtlplay.be_ (Belgium, so native access for me), I note after some tests that [my 'json-prune' rule](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/0c18c5e072279e6f228bdf29cda123f469e5c05e/FrenchFilter/sections/general_extensions.txt#L77) still works correctly there … while not anymore on _6play.fr_ after 14 months (according to these three reports [[1](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/16905), [2](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/16910), [3](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/143831)], all coming recently in a very short period of time). However, everything still exists, according to a 'json-prune' (in log mode).\r\n\r\n**Therefore, would it be possible for you to try that?**\r\n_(instead of removing properties, it set their values to false — like required for `tf1.fr`)_\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Reveal rules …</summary>\r\n\r\n```adblock\r\n!

TESTING STUFF\r\n! 1) Do this prevent \"ads jingle\" at start + \"ads\" (from any possible provider btw here, including their second one, smartX) + anti-adblock message, as before with my 'json-prune' rule?\r\n! 2) If only AAB message is shown, is it OK after re-activating your AAB stuff found above in addition to this rule?\r\n6play.fr#%#(function(){let callCounter=0;const nativeJSONParse=JSON.parse;const handler={apply(){callCounter++;const obj=Reflect.apply(...arguments);if(callCounter<=150){if(obj.hasOwnProperty('appName')){obj.applaunch.data.player.features.ad.enabled=false;obj.applaunch.data.player.features.ad.dai.enabled=false;}}else{JSON.parse=nativeJSONParse;}return obj;}};JSON.parse=new Proxy(JSON.parse,handler);})();\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n###### :arrow_right_hook: If functional, this one will be another possible candidate for a new trusted scriptlet allowing to set JSON value. :thumbsup:\r\n\r\n##### _Thanks in advance!_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1453428126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-03T12:00:43Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

sanitize, adblocker, together with adguard, .. it used to work fine before even with these extentions, and now disabled them. and use just adguard adblocker from ios. \r\n> This site uses a lot of watching video ads, before going to the next web page, perhaps by mgids or mgads, but adguard does block them from happening. I have been using adguard for more than at least 9 years or more.\r\n> and never have issues with it.\r\n> I always have in mind of buying adguard premium, but are afraid of these adblocker being detected.\r\n> My favorite feature of adguard is is the custom user rule, that I can add, but lately it is not functioning as before.\r\n> \r\n> I believe they just updated their rules by detecting adblockers with adguard. \r\n> Besides they updated completely to a newer website.\r\n> Meaning sanitize and adblocker is not the culprit here. .. \r\n> \r\n> All I have to disable is the General rule in adguard and it stops, the adblocker detected page of sportsplays.com, see photos, please.\r\n> the rest work fine like eliminating ads and video ads, ads comments by this website\r\n> Sorry for the long description explanations I hope it helps understanding the problem better.\r\n> \r\n> I like to use a lot of cosmetic filtering useless item on a webpage, like social media buttons comments and sports betting ads and recomendations.\r\n> The other website I use a lot is www.covers.com, but unable to block sports betting ads and recomendations.\r\n> Can you please check it out too, or do you need a separate report inquiry on this website?\r\n> Thank you for your attentions. Take care all the best.
