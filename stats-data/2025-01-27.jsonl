ATTENTION\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.

browser extension is enabled, I am unable to access https://analytics.pinterest.com/. However, I don't face any issues accessing https://pinterest.com/. I tried disabling the browser extension and even turned off protection from the AdGuard desktop app, but the page still wouldn't load. Strangely, the issue disappears only after I completely uninstall the AdGuard software, allowing me to access the website without any problems.\r\n> \r\n> Please note that this doesn't seem to be related to the browser extension itself. I tested it on Firefox, where the AdGuard extension isn't installed, and I still couldn't access the page.\r\n> \r\n> Could you kindly guide me on how to access https://analytics.pinterest.com/ without having to uninstall AdGuard?

tweaked a few times.\nFor a more complete fix, you should add this instead:\n```\ne24.no,vg.no##div[id^=\"sp_message_container_\"]\ncmp.e24.no,cmp.vg.no#%#//scriptlet('trusted-click-element', '.btns-container > button[title=\"Tilpass cookies\"]')\ncmp.e24.no,cmp.vg.no#%#//scriptlet('trusted-click-element', '.message-row > button[title=\"Avvis alle\"]', '', '2000')\n@@||cmp.*.no^$domain=e24.no|vg.no\n@@||privacy-mgmt.com/mms^$domain=e24.no|vg.no\n```\nAlso, '**AdGuard Cookie Notices filter**' currently includes `e24.no` in a blocking rule for `/wrapperMessagingWithoutDetection.js`, so you should remove the domain from that blocking rule too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2616700633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-01-27T19:23:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
