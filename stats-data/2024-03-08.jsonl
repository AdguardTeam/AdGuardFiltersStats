It appears on my iPhone. I'm aware that there is a rule in the Japanese filter to hide the class PC_SP_NEWS_D_GROUP , but the rule doesn't seem to be effective. I've tried restarting the device, updating the filter (waiting for 5 minutes), clearing Safari's cache, toggling advanced protection on and off (waiting for 5 minutes), but the issue persists.
