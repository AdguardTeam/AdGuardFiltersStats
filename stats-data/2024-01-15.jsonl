Настройки сбрасываются. Выставил нужные галки, заходишь спустя какое-то время - опять всё по дефолту, с отключенным DNS и защитой от трекинга.\r\n> \r\n> 2. Не работают фильтры. Даже конструктор заявок не видит включённый Фильтр раздражителей AdGuard (см. второй скриншот).\r\n> \r\n> 3. Не работает Пользовательский фильтр. При блокировке рекламы вручную и обновлении страницы никакого эффекта не наблюдается.\r\n> \r\n> 4. Сайты перестают открываться в принципе при включении фильтрации HTTPS. Даже Google. При этом уведомление о том, что данный фильтр нужно включить, появляется снова и снова.\r\n> \r\n> 5. На смартфоне перестаёт открываться часть приложений, пока не отключишь перенаправление трафика через прокси (в Управлении приложениями в AdGuard).\r\n> \r\n> 6. Чтобы два раза не вставать, упомяну старую проблему - при включении опции автоматического уничтожения сторонних кук наблюдаются баги на некоторых сайтах. Например, в таск-менеджере Targetprocess отрубалось автосохранение и прочие функции, пока методом тыка не была найдена указанная причина.\r\n> \r\n> Что было сделано:\r\n> 1. Отвязаны все устройства в личном кабинете.\r\n> 2. Переустановлены все продукты AdGuard.\r\n> 3.

You can go ad-free with YouTube Premium, and creators can still get paid from your subscription.\" This message prevents me from watching any video on YouTube unless I disable my adblocker or pay for a subscription.\r\n> \r\n> To reproduce this problem, you need to have ADGUARD adblocker installed on your browser and visit YouTube's website.

Comment\r\n> После недавних обновлений AdGuard перестала работать блокировка рекламы ВООБЩЕ. \r\n> \r\n> 1. Настройки сбрасываются. Выставил нужные галки, заходишь спустя какое-то время - опять всё по дефолту, с отключенным DNS и защитой от трекинга.\r\n> \r\n> 2. Не работают фильтры. Даже конструктор заявок не видит включённый Фильтр раздражителей AdGuard (см. второй скриншот).\r\n> \r\n> 3. Не работает Пользовательский фильтр. При блокировке рекламы вручную и обновлении страницы никакого эффекта не наблюдается.\r\n> \r\n> 4. Сайты перестают открываться в принципе при включении фильтрации HTTPS. Даже Google. При этом уведомление о том, что данный фильтр нужно включить, появляется снова и снова.\r\n> \r\n> 5. На смартфоне перестаёт открываться часть приложений, пока не отключишь перенаправление трафика через прокси (в Управлении приложениями в AdGuard).\r\n> \r\n> 6. Чтобы два раза не вставать, упомяну старую проблему - при включении опции автоматического уничтожения сторонних кук наблюдаются баги на некоторых сайтах.

Issue URL (Annoyance)\r\n [https://nnmclub.to/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1637916&sid=176fb7b435f6fb6c37e7e206fb25f739](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnnmclub.to%2Fforum%2Fviewtopic.php%3Ft%3D1637916%26sid%3D176fb7b435f6fb6c37e7e206fb25f739)\r\n### Comment\r\n> После недавних обновлений AdGuard перестала работать блокировка рекламы ВООБЩЕ. \r\n> \r\n> 1. Настройки сбрасываются. Выставил нужные галки, заходишь спустя какое-то время - опять всё по дефолту, с отключенным DNS и защитой от трекинга.\r\n> \r\n> 2. Не работают фильтры. Даже конструктор заявок не видит включённый Фильтр раздражителей AdGuard (см. второй скриншот).\r\n> \r\n> 3. Не работает Пользовательский фильтр. При блокировке рекламы вручную и обновлении страницы никакого эффекта не наблюдается.\r\n> \r\n> 4. Сайты перестают открываться в принципе при включении фильтрации HTTPS. Даже Google. При этом уведомление о том, что данный фильтр нужно включить, появляется снова и снова.\r\n> \r\n> 5. На смартфоне перестаёт открываться часть приложений, пока не отключишь перенаправление трафика через прокси (в Управлении приложениями в AdGuard).\r\n> \r\n> 6. Чтобы два раза не вставать, упомяну старую проблему - при включении опции автоматического уничтожения сторонних кук наблюдаются баги на некоторых сайтах. Например, в таск-менеджере Targetprocess отрубалось автосохранение и прочие функции, пока методом тыка не была найдена указанная причина.\r\n> \r\n> Что было сделано:\r\n> 1. Отвязаны все устройства в личном кабинете.\r\n> 2. Переустановлены все продукты AdGuard.\r\n> 3. Настройки неоднократно сбрасывались до дефолтных.\r\n> Ничего не помогло.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oioaupt4hc0wwgkcsk4g0cocsoo088060y0tuu7ghc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hpv30mk5l5skckwkks4gss000go8s4kh143c01o080.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.2.241\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>EasyList China, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>Liste FR, <br/>ROList, <br/>Icelandic ABP List, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>Polish GDPR-Cookies Filters, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>EasyList Polish, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170767/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1891825445","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170767#issuecomment-1891825445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170767","id":1891825445,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85wwvcl","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-15T10:31:24Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T10:31:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Не повторяется.
