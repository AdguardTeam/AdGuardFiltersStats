Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [http://e.mail.ru](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fe.mail.ru)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Здравствуйте! Воспроизвести проблему - проще простого (я не увидел куда крепить видео, я даже записал). \r\n> Просто запустите приложение Mail.ru или яндекс.go. Всё — в рекламе и раздражлителях. Mail: баннеры, видеореклама при входе через раз. Yandex go: баннеры, всплывающие окна, следующие за тапом (когда ставишь точку на карте) раздражители, реклама даже прокладок (лол).  \r\n> \r\n> Приложение пропускает рекламу в Android приложениях mail.ru и Яндекс Go. Я уже даже не знаю, продлевать ли мне лицензию! Буду признателен за обратную связь, и какие-либо решения по данной ситуации.  \r\n> \r\n> Являюсь клиентом Эдгард с 2013 года, и только в этом году он регулярно пропускает рекламу, особенно задолбал mail и яндекс-это настоящая помойка которая вообще никак не фильтруется, реклама буквально на 80% экрана. Планирую приобрести Эдгард VPN потому что мне ваша компания очень импонирует, Вы очень очень давно меня спасаете. Но в этом году почему-то всё очень скудно по фильтрации, Хотя регулярно обновляю (а сегодня установил фоновое обновление) и плачу ежегодно лицензию. Все равно я и дальше хочу пользоваться вашим продуктом! Заранее благодарю и жду обратной связи. Всех благ. \r\n```\r\nUsername: @GABR4D\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/iwj42x5qwu0wwg0ocos4w4og0g4oco08qdxy82mwjs.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/kmsnd9h8yj4c4w0o4cows4ccgs8ogg8a94cfx7605s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/cuvwcbogfk00osks488gckgwk404scoczbu2ie70ug.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/2bi3i3swpfok880ckowso8wg84kc8w0gaosl0miptc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/h09v0f191w08c84wwkw8woooocsogkcmlyqwl7756o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 6 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 6](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/lghvzm5x1kgo4sko4sg0cs8wkgoswgc62tbtudbnxo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 7 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 7](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/m4flsltvdy8k4wg8w0wwgkw4480g4gc251e4c0iukh.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 8 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 8](https://cdn.adguardcdn.net/sitereports/e7csw0af6soow44swoo84c0ckwcg4oga8ouezpnxnk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.11\r\nSystem version: | `Android 15; MagicOS 9.0`\r\nBrowser: | Brave\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>RU AdList: Counters\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.info/settings/import.html?product_type=and&product_version=4.11&system_version=Android+15%3B+MagicOS+9.0&browser=brave&filters=2.11.101.3.17.118.18.19.20.14.1.212&android.mode=VPN&android.system_root=false&dns.enabled=false&https.filtering=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.strip_url=true&stealth.hide_search_queries=false&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_trackers=true&license_type=paid)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/220813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/220813/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3706550074","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/220813#issuecomment-3706550074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/220813","id":3706550074,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87c7Xc6","user":{"login":"GABR4D","id":216908857,"node_id":"U_kgDODO3EOQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216908857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GABR4D","html_url":"https://github.com/GABR4D","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GABR4D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GABR4D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GABR4D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GABR4D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GABR4D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GABR4D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GABR4D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GABR4D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GABR4D/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-03T00:51:53Z","updated_at":"2026-01-03T00:51:53Z","body":"@Sergey-Lyapin Фильтрация была включена. @Alex-302 достаточно просто открыть эти приложения.
