Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### To avoid invalid pull requests, please check and confirm following terms\r\n\r\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report;\r\n- [x] My code follows the [guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\nPush notification scam ads trying to fool user to subscribe their push notification which then deliver malicious ads.\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [x] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [ ] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Enter the issue address\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\nE.g. `https://adzmusic.com/ZLsNoEPrQn3DK8bMvPdo-gxu4H9USwHDKQ_StreN9jI/?clck=1d58d79744476eed686a0537d2a3bc86&sid=14892298`\r\n`https://www.stonecarver.top/play-music-video/?pl=cY0ooXMxhEOdj-8NgPIvCw&sm=play-music-video&click_id=8c17egmfvu3hqfeecb&hash=vOmj42LBq2tQilhQn41t6w&exp=1682311985`\r\nThe second link is now suspended, I can grab a new one if needed. These two rules have been time-tested, no FP and blocking lots of those sites. There is another regex rule useful to block them but for this PR I'll focus on non-regex rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain

Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### To avoid invalid pull requests, please check and confirm following terms\r\n\r\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report;\r\n- [x] My code follows the [guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\nPush notification scam ads trying to fool user to subscribe their push notification which then deliver malicious ads.\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [x] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [ ] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Enter the issue address\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\nE.g. `https://adzmusic.com/ZLsNoEPrQn3DK8bMvPdo-gxu4H9USwHDKQ_StreN9jI/?clck=1d58d79744476eed686a0537d2a3bc86&sid=14892298`\r\n`https://www.stonecarver.top/play-music-video/?pl=cY0ooXMxhEOdj-8NgPIvCw&sm=play-music-video&click_id=8c17egmfvu3hqfeecb&hash=vOmj42LBq2tQilhQn41t6w&exp=1682311985`\r\nThe second link is now suspended, I can grab a new one if needed. These two rules have been time-tested, no FP and blocking lots of those sites. There is another regex rule useful to block them but for this PR I'll focus on non-regex rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain
