Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [http://soundcloud.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Adguard just won't work at all. I have reinstalled the app, reset, but it won't block ads. I see all ads on every app that i have on my phone. Its been weeks i am reporting it to adguard and they have been no help at all which is really frustrating. \r\nUsername: `@Sakciit`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/aj9oevp8rdsg4sgsck0kkwccw00go0g14cun3c8hri.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ocen7n1xrsgswcggk8wgsgck0sk084cmk99gtx9yis.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6vtlcst5fi0wwcwwk8888owc0okkws82v22k5pdu9c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.8\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets\r\nOther extensions used: | Non","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2685144608","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236#issuecomment-2685144608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236","id":2685144608,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86gDA4g","user":{"login":"sakciit","id":196661562,"node_id":"U_kgDOC7jROg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/196661562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit","html_url":"https://github.com/sakciit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakciit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-26T14:11:57Z","updated_at":"2025-02-26T14:11:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"To clarify, it seems you're suggesting that AdGuard cannot block ads in social networking apps like Facebook and YouTube due to their use of SSL pinning, and that it also fails to block ads on SoundCloud via DNS-level blocking.
