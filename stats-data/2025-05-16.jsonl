Install the **AdGuard iOS app** and activate the custom DNS server, or install the **AdGuard DNS profile** on iOS.  \r\n> 2. Connect to Wi-Fi and verify that blocking and safe search are working.  \r\n> 3. Switch to **cellular data** and test again — content is not filtered.  \r\n>    *(Other AdGuard DNS rules and features still work regularly.)*\r\n> \r\n> ## Expected Behavior  \r\n> Parental control features — **site blocking**, **safe search**, **YouTube restricted mode**, and **hidden comments** — should function over both **Wi-Fi and cellular**.\r\n> \r\n> ## Actual Behavior  \r\n> On cellular, **adult content is not blocked** and **safe search is disabled**.\r\n> \r\n> ## Environment  \r\n> - Device: *iPhone (iOS 17+)*  \r\n> - DNS Profile: *Personal Private AdGuard DNS*\r\n> \r\n> ## Notes  \r\n> - Tested across multiple devices: *Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Apple TV*  \r\n> - Tried various server configurations, including default with only **Parental Control** enabled  \r\n> - Parental Control fails on **cellular data**, including for devices connected via **hotspot**  \r\n> - [AdGuard DNS test](https://adguard.com/en/test.html) passes on cellular  \r\n> - Tested with both **native iOS DNS** and **AdGuard DNS app** implementation  \r\n> - The screenshot showing AdGuard DNS disabled was taken while connected to **Wi-Fi**  \r\n> - The screenshot showing AdGuard DNS enabled was taken while using **cellular data**\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ht2mlc9zw0840ko84cok8ogw4gs00s05znlb30c9nw.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2wdou2dkixa8k8c8w4kkc0okg8koc0g2d28y8pko2z.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qbhrhb853hck0oc0k4g0k0w484g84ckhao7bgs7dfk.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | iPhone 12 Pro running AdGuard DNS Parental Control\r\nDNS server: | Private AdGuard DNS server\r\nSystem version: | iOS 18.5\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nBlocklists: | <b>General:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205526/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-16T06:18:29Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
