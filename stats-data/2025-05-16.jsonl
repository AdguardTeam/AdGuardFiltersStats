Install the **AdGuard iOS app** and activate the custom DNS server, or install the **AdGuard DNS profile** on iOS.  \r\n> 2. Connect to Wi-Fi and verify that blocking and safe search are working.  \r\n> 3. Switch to **cellular data** and test again — content is not filtered.  \r\n>    *(Other AdGuard DNS rules and features still work regularly.)*\r\n> \r\n> ## Expected Behavior  \r\n> Parental control features — **site blocking**, **safe search**, **YouTube restricted mode**, and **hidden comments** — should function over both **Wi-Fi and cellular**.\r\n> \r\n> ## Actual Behavior  \r\n> On cellular, **adult content is not blocked** and **safe search is disabled**.\r\n> \r\n> ## Environment  \r\n> - Device: *iPhone (iOS 17+)*  \r\n> - DNS Profile: *Personal Private AdGuard DNS*\r\n> \r\n> ## Notes  \r\n> - Tested across multiple devices: *Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Apple TV*  \r\n> - Tried various server configurations, including default with only **Parental Control** enabled  \r\n> - Parental Control fails on **cellular data**, including for devices connected via **hotspot**  \r\n> - [AdGuard DNS test](https://adguard.com/en/test.html) passes on cellular  \r\n> - Tested with both **native iOS DNS** and **AdGuard DNS app** implementation  \r\n> - The screenshot showing AdGuard DNS disabled was taken while connected to **Wi-Fi**  \r\n> - The screenshot showing AdGuard DNS enabled was taken while using **cellular data**\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ht2mlc9zw0840ko84cok8ogw4gs00s05znlb30c9nw.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2wdou2dkixa8k8c8w4kkc0okg8koc0g2d28y8pko2z.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qbhrhb853hck0oc0k4g0k0w484g84ckhao7bgs7dfk.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | iPhone 12 Pro running AdGuard DNS Parental Control\r\nDNS server: | Private AdGuard DNS server\r\nSystem version: | iOS 18.5\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nBlocklists: | <b>General:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205526/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-16T06:18:29Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Например, на данном сайте погоды. Включены все фильтры, вообще все, что можно включить. Проблема возникла до обновления. Сегодня обновила приложение, сначала приложение перестало открываться, потом после перестановки приложения открылось, я снова выставила все возможные фильтры,но реклама все равно есть. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/n6qij9gw9iooc448cgo0swgcc884o448frvx3g6kho.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.9\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks, <br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>AdGuard Experimental, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Нет","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205547/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2886386001","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205547#issuecomment-2886386001","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205547","id":2886386001,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86sCsFR","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-16T10:56:12Z","updated_at":"2025-05-16T10:56:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Не повторяется.\nПроверьте, определяется ли AdGuard на https://adguard.com/test.html","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2886386001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-16T10:56:15Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Reloading the page has the same effect that it may reveal the page or another blank white page.  No other website does this.  This only started happening yesterday after updating AdGuard for Safari in the Mac App Store to version 1.11.22.  I had previously been on version 1.11.20 and this had never happened previously.  I use the default configuration of AdGuard and have no changed any filter settings, I have not added any filters or custom rules.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/o5q7s2qvvs0gckcckkswcg4sogswgg0nx29bsgokxw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b089003mme0c40wc8wwccoksgsgksgo2m32ype7hpk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.22\r\nSystem version: | macOS 15.4.1\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection\r\nOther extensions used: | I have no other Safari extensions","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205556/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-16T11:49:53Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
