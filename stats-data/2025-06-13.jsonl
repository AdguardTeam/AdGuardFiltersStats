it might be easier to reproduce by using Private Browsing(safari) in my end.\r\n> \r\n> I reported this issue to support adguard and got advice that try to reinstall adguard. After doing that this issue occurred again so I recorded videos that shows this issue. Please check the videos if you feel like it.\r\n> I don't know how to share  videos when I report issues,so I uploaded them to google drive.\r\n> Video1 shows when adguard disabled and Video2 shows adguard enabled.

[here](https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/), there is a tracker `*-datareceiver.aki-game.net`. Asterisk means the region where player is playing the game. At main menu the collected system and hardware info is sent to `us-datareceiver.aki-game.net` but when I selected Europe region and started playing, domain changed to `eu-datareceiver.aki-game.net`. That means that there are domains for other regions too. So, the rule I recommend is:\n\n`||*-datareceiver.aki-game.net^`\n\nData is sent in short regular intervals in POST requests and is gzip compressed.\n\nGame is free but requires an account, you can link other accounts, so you can test this yourself. Game is also available for Android and iOS.\n\n\nAdguard DNS is set up in my system settings, I'm _**not**_ using [Adguard private dns](https://adguard-dns.io/)\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-13T06:00:51Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.

it might be easier to reproduce by using Private Browsing(safari) in my end.\r\n> \r\n> I reported this issue to support adguard and got advice that try to reinstall adguard. After doing that this issue occurred again so I recorded videos that shows this issue. Please check the videos if you feel like it.\r\n> I don't know how to share  videos when I report issues,so I uploaded them to google drive.\r\n> Video1 shows when adguard disabled and Video2 shows adguard enabled.
