it might be easier to reproduce by using Private Browsing(safari) in my end.\r\n> \r\n> I reported this issue to support adguard and got advice that try to reinstall adguard. After doing that this issue occurred again so I recorded videos that shows this issue. Please check the videos if you feel like it.\r\n> I don't know how to share  videos when I report issues,so I uploaded them to google drive.\r\n> Video1 shows when adguard disabled and Video2 shows adguard enabled.

[here](https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/), there is a tracker `*-datareceiver.aki-game.net`. Asterisk means the region where player is playing the game. At main menu the collected system and hardware info is sent to `us-datareceiver.aki-game.net` but when I selected Europe region and started playing, domain changed to `eu-datareceiver.aki-game.net`. That means that there are domains for other regions too. So, the rule I recommend is:\n\n`||*-datareceiver.aki-game.net^`\n\nData is sent in short regular intervals in POST requests and is gzip compressed.\n\nGame is free but requires an account, you can link other accounts, so you can test this yourself. Game is also available for Android and iOS.\n\n\nAdguard DNS is set up in my system settings, I'm _**not**_ using [Adguard private dns](https://adguard-dns.io/)\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-13T06:00:51Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript. ( [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing#264](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing/issues/264) )\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Please check that there no another web browser extension that has adblocking feature is enabled on your web browser. It can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> Saving memory feature of your web browser or sleep feature of your operating system can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n> In this case, please re-enable AdGuard's filtering by toggling the protection toggle.\n> Following the instructions can be needed.\n\n### The instructions\n1. Force to update the filters by clicking the reload button in AdGuard Browser Extension/AdGuard mobile or update tray menu in your system tray. [^2]\n2. Reload the YouTube webpage without cache by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> [^3].\n3. Clear cache, cookies and site data of your web browser.\n4.
