option and FINALLY even with no DNS either, it still was loading the glitched way.\r\n> \r\n> It was not until I turned off the final \"Ad blocking\" even though 0 filters were active, that AdGuard allowed the website to load, and of course it doesn't block anything.\r\n> \r\n> If there's any issue left I can only think it's some Stealth Mode thing but I don't think I have that on (actually

could not upload my normal Screenshots. It gave me an error, so I uploaded black screens. When I open a link with my filtering protection on specifically, DNS protection, the Spotify link will only open to the main Spotify page. When I disable specifically DNS protections, the Spotify link will correctly open directly to the song. I have also seen this happen with Reddit links. I believe the issue deals with how iPhones handle passing links between applications, and how the DNS filtering intercepts these and maybe clips off some important targeting information for the link. Either way, it means that all of the Spotify links my friend sent me an iMessage and Instagram I cannot open properly.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hw2pakz3v7s4g0og4kcoks4ggg4kcwo7qjhia8jjdo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hw2pakz3v7s4g0og4kcoks4ggg4kcwo7qjhia8jjdo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.5.0\r\nBrowser: | All apps including email, instagram, and iMessage \r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162674/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-28T10:36:26Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

could not upload my normal Screenshots. It gave me an error, so I uploaded black screens. When I open a link with my filtering protection on specifically, DNS protection, the Spotify link will only open to the main Spotify page.
