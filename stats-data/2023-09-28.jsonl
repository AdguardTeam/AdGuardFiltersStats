option and FINALLY even with no DNS either, it still was loading the glitched way.\r\n> \r\n> It was not until I turned off the final \"Ad blocking\" even though 0 filters were active, that AdGuard allowed the website to load, and of course it doesn't block anything.\r\n> \r\n> If there's any issue left I can only think it's some Stealth Mode thing but I don't think I have that on (actually
