При этом в адресной строке странная ссылка, с которой пытается перенаправить на реальную страницу, но не может. В выдаче изменяется ссылка на сайт, если пробовать его открыть или скопировать. Это можно наблюдать в нижнем левом углу, наведя курсор мыши на заголовок сайта. Чтобы убрать этот эффект, необходимо отключить расширение и 2 раза обновить страницу Shift+F5.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/j5t7dzxawc8w80k84000cckgkw8gg8wd3k6zsxqk34.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/i81grd8p8n400kcos0k08sggw40cg0g4l47enihafw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.56\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>ABPindo, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>EasyList China, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>YousList</details>\r\nOther extensions used: | Google Документы офлайн 1.62.0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155042/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-03T06:40:43Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Это можно наблюдать в нижнем левом углу, наведя курсор мыши на заголовок сайта.
