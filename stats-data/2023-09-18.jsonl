When always a new Firefox is released, I have to fix his browser, because he has \"Firefox for Web.de\" installed. He has web.de as homepage.\r\n> Even when I tell him, that he doesn't care about updating his browser (it's enabled by default), he probably gets frighten by this Banner and installs it. If you don't carefully read, you get a modified browser.\r\n> \r\n> This Banner should be treated IMO like some sort of Smartbanner.
