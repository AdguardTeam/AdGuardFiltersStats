Включить HTTPS-филтьрацию не представляется возможным - приложение выдаёт ошибку, что якобы нет интернета. Помимо приложения AdGuard на Android, в нём в пользовательских DNS установлен AdGuard DNS, в котором  включены все фильтры без пометки \"problematic\" за исключением HaGeZi's URL Shortener Blocklist, HaGeZi's Anti-Piracy Blocklist, HaGeZi's Allowlist Referral, No Google, ShadowWhisperer's Dating List, но это не помогает.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @Symbiote2099\r\n```\r\n\r\n###
