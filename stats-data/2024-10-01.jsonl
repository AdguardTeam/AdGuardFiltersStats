Il semble que ce problème soit causé par cette règle : `||stripchat.com^$popup,third-party` veuillez ajouter cette règle comme solution temporaire jusqu'à ce que le problème mentionné ci-dessus soit résolu. Vous pouvez également suivre la réponse des développeurs. `||stripchat.com^$popup,third-party,badfilter`\r\n\r\nBonjour, merci pour les retours. **Je ne comprend pas et ne sais pas où il faut ajouter** \" `||stripchat.com^$popup,third-party \" ou \" ||stripchat.com^$popup,third-party,badfilter \" pour avoir de nouveau accès au site. Cela m'ennuie, mais depuis quelques jours j'utilise de nouveau l'extension que j'utilisais il y a plusieurs années (avant AdGuard), je parle de l'extension \"uBlock Origin\". Celle-ci bloque correctement et ne m'empêche pas d'aller sur certains sites Web bloqués dorénavant avec l'extension AdGuard. C'est vraiment dommage, car j'utilise AdGuard depuis plusieurs années et je suis déçu de ne plus pouvoir l'utiliser. Trop de problèmes ces derniers temps.\r\n\r\n**Si quelqu'un peut m'expliquer où ajouter la règle ci-dessus, ça m'intéresse.

Not only the translator but also the stock graph 1 year 5 year maximum period buttons that can be used in Google's main search do not work. When you hit a certain store, the results are displayed on the map. When you click on the store, it should get bigger and show more detailed information, but that doesn't work either.\r\n> \r\n>  For some reason, many of the features available in the main Google search do not work.
