using adguard to view video/audio content on a macOS based product.  \r\n> \r\n> I believe google has now designed their audiovisual codec around the idea that if you're using a content blocker that the \"audio\" ad•layer containing the \"smoother\" audio. The one that does not peak or sound tinny will be dropped.\r\n> \r\n> Probably will continue to roll out changes like these periodically around  WWDC and their own developer conferences. I know this will always be a dancing target so I'm passing on two weeks of good luck on to the poor soul that has to fix this. \r\n> \r\n> I've heard this from a few other users as well. The screen shots are useless (🫤) So here is some ideas on how to patch it. \r\n> \r\n> **0** - EMPTY your Caches & Browser cookies when testing for it. Seems to work for a minute or two. \r\n> **1** - TRY Disabling Ambient mode. \r\n> **2** - Part out the same video to two identical machines to see the \"losses/spacial audio\" layer. Use someone top tier (Mr. Beast, MBKHD, HBO Max, etc) because they will have access to this service ideally. \r\n> **3** - For a longer copy of the layer you are targeting use Youtube movies. The free ones might have it. Paid definitely will. \r\n> \r\n> **PS** Step 7 of your report service removes formatting from your reports. There was spaces and line breaks to make this legible.  \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/KXrDdzS.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/S6QSUoQ.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.13\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1553857492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-19T00:47:56Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Android device (Google Pixel 2XL) when AdGuard is running. \r\n> When I try to login I receive an error saying \"Connection required. Please try again when you're back online\".\r\n> I have looked in the filtering log and occasionally see requests being blocked, but not every time I try to log in, only occasionally. I have tried adding exceptions for the requests being blocked, but this doesn't seem to have helped (even after a restart and shoppix-app reinstall). \r\n> If I disable 'Route traffic through AdGuard' for this specific app in the AdGuard settings, I am able to login in again. If I then re-enable 'Route traffic through AdGuard' whilst the shoppix app is still running, it acts as if it doesn't have an internet connection, insisting that it is offline. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/RwqiFAn.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/21n4o6I.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.0.788\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS (DNS-over-HTTPS)`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nUserscripts: | If extensions have become userscripts in the beta, then I use AdGuard extension. \r\nThe beta also doesn't appear to have stealth mode as an option, or filtering method (high quality Vs high speed)\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1554231196","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998#issuecomment-1554231196","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998","id":1554231196,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85co6-c","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-19T08:31:56Z","updated_at":"2023-05-19T08:31:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Btw I have a rooted device, but cannot install on both(","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1554231196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-19T08:31:56Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @mattjbr123\r\n> I'm having an issue with the 'Shoppix' app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kantarworldpanel.shoppix&hl=en_GB&gl=US&pli=1) installed on my Android device (Google Pixel 2XL) when AdGuard is running. \r\n> When I try to login I receive an error saying \"Connection required. Please try again when you're back online\".\r\n> I have looked in the filtering log and occasionally see requests being blocked, but not every time I try to log in, only occasionally. I have tried adding exceptions for the requests being blocked, but this doesn't seem to have helped (even after a restart and shoppix-app reinstall). \r\n> If I disable 'Route traffic through AdGuard' for this specific app in the AdGuard settings, I am able to login in again. If I then re-enable 'Route traffic through AdGuard' whilst the shoppix app is still running, it acts as if it doesn't have an internet connection, insisting that it is offline. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/RwqiFAn.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/21n4o6I.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.0.788\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS (DNS-over-HTTPS)`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nUserscripts: | If extensions have become userscripts in the beta, then I use AdGuard extension. \r\nThe beta also doesn't appear to have stealth mode as an option, or filtering method (high quality Vs high speed)\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1554230292","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998#issuecomment-1554230292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998","id":1554230292,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85co6wU","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-19T08:31:06Z","updated_at":"2023-05-19T08:31:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mattjbr123 Not all apps trust to AdGuard self-signed certificate.
