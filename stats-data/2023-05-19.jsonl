using adguard to view video/audio content on a macOS based product.  \r\n> \r\n> I believe google has now designed their audiovisual codec around the idea that if you're using a content blocker that the \"audio\" ad•layer containing the \"smoother\" audio. The one that does not peak or sound tinny will be dropped.\r\n> \r\n> Probably will continue to roll out changes like these periodically around  WWDC and their own developer conferences. I know this will always be a dancing target so I'm passing on two weeks of good luck on to the poor soul that has to fix this. \r\n> \r\n> I've heard this from a few other users as well. The screen shots are useless (🫤) So here is some ideas on how to patch it. \r\n> \r\n> **0** - EMPTY your Caches & Browser cookies when testing for it. Seems to work for a minute or two. \r\n> **1** - TRY Disabling Ambient mode. \r\n> **2** - Part out the same video to two identical machines to see the \"losses/spacial audio\" layer. Use someone top tier (Mr. Beast, MBKHD, HBO Max, etc) because they will have access to this service ideally. \r\n> **3** - For a longer copy of the layer you are targeting use Youtube movies. The free ones might have it. Paid definitely will. \r\n> \r\n> **PS** Step 7 of your report service removes formatting from your reports. There was spaces and line breaks to make this legible.  \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/KXrDdzS.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/S6QSUoQ.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.13\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1553857492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-19T00:47:56Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
