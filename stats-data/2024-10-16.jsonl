Comment\r\n> The main website is apnetv.to. This website is popular as it has various indian tv shows and movies. This website recently put some security features on its website where you click on a program which opens another page in which you click which version you want to watch e.g. flash etc.\r\n> \r\n> On clicking on flash video, another page opens which says it is processing the video. Once video process, user needs to click on play symbol after that another page opens and as soon as this page opens, it ask to Disable adblocker to help them make money?\r\n> \r\n> This issue is with every page I open after clicking on video page (flash) and it is very annoying as it won't allow me to watch video. If I disable adguard, then I get so many ads, some of them are very sexually explicit. As a matter of fact the developer of this site \"apnetv.to\" are doing illegal work in first place by posting videos of various movies and tv shows. \r\n> \r\n> Please check apnetv.to and find out yourself as every video page opens, asking user to disable adguard. I lodge this complaint before and was assign to someone who was asking for main website. I provide all the information but for some reason the person who was assigned to fix the issue, close my complaint with no results.\r\n> I update adguard and done whatever I can but no use.\r\n> Please help to STOP this annoying nuisance.\r\n> Thanks.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/76pioo2xdo0s0w8w88co0wws8sgoos4efklsxgt1u8.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.30\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nTracking protection options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | windows defender","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2416871440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-10-16T13:39:00Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
