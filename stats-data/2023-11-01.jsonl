This problem does not occur when the MetaMask extension is disabled. It seems that issue 249, sent in 2015 (https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/249), is not working correctly today.\r\n> \r\n> To fix the issue, I disabled the following rules in “AdGuard Tracking Protection”:\r\n> ||eviltracker.net^$third-party\r\n> ||trackersimulator.org^$third-party\r\n> ||eviltracker.net^\r\n> ||trackersimulator.org^\r\n> \r\n> Then I added the following rules to “User rules” so that it works with my configuration:\r\n> ||trackersimulator.org^$stealth=referrer\r\n> ||eviltracker.net^$stealth=referrer\r\n> \r\n> Can you adjust AdGuard’s rules?

This problem does not occur when the MetaMask extension is disabled. It seems that issue 249, sent in 2015 (https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/249), is not working correctly today.\r\n> \r\n> To fix the issue, I disabled the following rules in “AdGuard Tracking Protection”:\r\n> ||eviltracker.net^$third-party\r\n> ||trackersimulator.org^$third-party\r\n> ||eviltracker.net^\r\n> ||trackersimulator.org^\r\n> \r\n> Then I added the following rules to “User rules” so that it works with my configuration:\r\n> ||trackersimulator.org^$stealth=referrer\r\n> ||eviltracker.net^$stealth=referrer\r\n> \r\n> Can you adjust AdGuard’s rules?
