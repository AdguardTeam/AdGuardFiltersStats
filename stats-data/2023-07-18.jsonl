Comment\r\nUsername: @DandelionSprout\r\n> While not logged in, an uncloseable login prompt when scrolling down on not only frontpages, but also very long individual posts nowadays.\r\n> \r\n> Since the mass exodus from Twitter to Tumblr seems to me personally like it'd warrant fast treatment, I'll let you guys borrow `www.tumblr.com#?##glass-container:has(p + p):has(a[href^=\"/auth/google?\"])`

from Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List into AdGuard Popups Filters with no reservations or conditions of any kind. Alternately you guys can also use whichever entries you guys would write.\r\n> \r\n> The entry has worked for at least 2 months now, even if there still may be other Tumblr-side annoyances remaining (Most notably that the ••• buttons don't work after scrolling down slightly, which I never found a good fix for).\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/3ile3nh8woe884w0k8gog4kw0k4gsg86bgh67exwww.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | uBO 1.50.0 + I Don't Care About Cookies 3.4.7\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Serbo-Croatian List\r\nCustom filters: | uBlock Filters - Ads,<br>uBlock Filters - Badware Risks,<br>uBlock Filters - Annoyances,<br>Fanboy's Notifications Blocking List","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155809/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1640535436","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155809#issuecomment-1640535436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155809","id":1640535436,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85hyJWM","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-18T16:15:33Z","updated_at":"2023-07-18T16:15:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Morku\r\n> \r\n> Cookie Pop-up\r\n\r\nCan't reproduce.

Comment\r\nUsername: @DandelionSprout\r\n> While not logged in, an uncloseable login prompt when scrolling down on not only frontpages, but also very long individual posts nowadays.\r\n> \r\n> Since the mass exodus from Twitter to Tumblr seems to me personally like it'd warrant fast treatment, I'll let you guys borrow `www.tumblr.com#?##glass-container:has(p + p):has(a[href^=\"/auth/google?\"])`
