I have tried to find out the filter that's causing it by turning each one on and off and reloading the website. But nothing seems to work. I also had issues with YouTube. However, I found a fix on an Ad Guard forum asking to add googlevideo.com to Advanced Settings filters. Overall, I'm a bit disappointed by the trouble here and there. Especially coming from uBlock Origin, where everything just seems to work.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/QlCseLj.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/d33TdYG.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.9.2.1234+release\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.google/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nCustom filters: | https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-clean-filters/-/blob/main/bpc-paywall-filter.txt\r\nUserscripts: | Web+of+Trust+(url:+https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js),<br>AdGuard+Extra+(url:+https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nOther extensions used: | Save to Pocket, Language Tool, Bitwarden","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142203/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-07T06:19:56Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
