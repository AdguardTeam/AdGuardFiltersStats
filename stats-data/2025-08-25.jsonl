rule\n\n```\n||static.klaviyo.com/onsite/js/telemetry\n||static.klaviyo.com/onsite/js/event_adapter\n||a.klaviyo.com\n```\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe correct blocked script should be\n\n```\n||static-tracking.klaviyo.com/onsite/*\n```\nwhich blocks any analytics scripts/API requests/etc that Klaviyo uses for shopper identification.\n\nWe should _not_ be blocking requests to `a.klaviyo.com`. That rule should be removed.\n\n### Additional information\n\nA similar issue was submitted: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210120#issuecomment-3128250521\n\nBut the fix implemented was not the proposed solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-08-25T09:24:09Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

description\n\n### Problem description\n\nKlaviyo Javascript is being blocked due to the addition of this rule\n\n```\n||static.klaviyo.com/onsite/js/telemetry\n||static.klaviyo.com/onsite/js/event_adapter\n||a.klaviyo.com\n```\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe correct blocked script should be\n\n```\n||static-tracking.klaviyo.com/onsite/*\n```\nwhich blocks any analytics scripts/API requests/etc that Klaviyo uses for shopper identification.\n\nWe should _not_ be blocking requests to `a.klaviyo.com`. That rule should be removed.\n\n### Additional information\n\nA similar issue was submitted: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210120#issuecomment-3128250521\n\nBut the fix implemented was not the proposed solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3220938526","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210537#issuecomment-3220938526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210537","id":3220938526,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86_-58e","user":{"login":"owen-carpenter-klaviyo","id":178830662,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqi9Rg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178830662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen-carpenter-klaviyo","html_url":"https://github.com/owen-carpenter-klaviyo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen-carpenter-klaviyo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen-carpenter-klaviyo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen-carpenter-klaviyo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen-carpenter-klaviyo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen-carpenter-klaviyo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen-carpenter-klaviyo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen-carpenter-klaviyo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen-carpenter-klaviyo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen-carpenter-klaviyo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-25T16:30:08Z","updated_at":"2025-08-25T16:30:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Please provide, we can create rules for non-DNS blocking.\n\nHi @Alex-302  - blocking a.klaviyo.com in its entirety also blocks some of our subscriptions endpoints that are critical for Klaviyo forms.

the last couple of weeks that the cookie pop-up loads every hour or so and needs to be removed/accepted via Adguard for Windows. If I visit the webpage the next day, it's there again and goes away after 1–2 seconds. Prior to this... The cookie pop-up was only there once on the first visit, and then I never saw it again until I deleted my browser data, did a fresh install or used incognito mode. Is it just me?\r\n```\r\nUsername: @sonnyxq\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Comment\r\n> I don't use my laptop much but when I did and I used Google docs on it I couldn't scroll up or down and had to use the arrows to move down, which I thought was a problem with my laptop but then on basically every other site I used I could scroll up and down fine, and a Google search reccomended I turn off any extensions I was using to see if it fixed anything, and in turning off this one, I could scroll fine again, really weird, also the reporting of bugs process was annoying as shit\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n

but then on basically every other site I used I could scroll up and down fine, and a Google search reccomended I turn off any extensions I was using to see if it fixed anything, and in turning off this one, I could scroll fine again, really weird, also the reporting of bugs process was annoying as shit\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n

be\n\n```\n||static-tracking.klaviyo.com/onsite/*\n```\nwhich blocks any analytics scripts/API requests/etc that Klaviyo uses for shopper identification.\n\nWe should _not_ be blocking requests to `a.klaviyo.com`.
