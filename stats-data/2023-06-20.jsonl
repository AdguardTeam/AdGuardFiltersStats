I found only one useful case. So, is there any way to deal with this site other than Liste FR?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/UD0GyTx.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/KGSsEyt.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/O532sW0.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.56\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Liste AR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-06-20T10:08:03Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Also the other blocked url “https://clickserve.dartsearch.net”, still no success. \r\n>  A quick Google search keeps leading me to how to ENABLE Adblocking for other issues, but not how to allow or (disable whatever filter that’s preventing my google search from opening the product I’m trying to locate). \r\n> \r\n> This issue isn’t isolated to home depot (or links that open other apps), pretty much any product I search for… which typically is successful in appearing in the first few of the “sponsored“ Google ads.. unless I go and disable AdGuard as a whole, I can’t actually go to the freaking page. I am specifically attempting to go to.\r\n> If there’s any assistance that somebody’s found, please let me know.
