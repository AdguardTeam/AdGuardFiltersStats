Can be shared using browser's menu.\r\n\r\nThe difference is that the browser's share menu uses the URL bar URL, which goes to the mobile site, while the share button uses the shortlink, which redirects to the desktop/mobile site depending on the visitor's device\r\n\r\nCopy from URL bar: `https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw`\r\n\r\nBrowser share button: `https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw`\r\n\r\nYoutube share button: `https://youtu.be/jNQXAC9IVRw?feature=shared`\r\n\r\nFurther, I don't think this is a \"Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc.\" in the sense that the list is intended to capture. The spammy/annoying buttons that this clearly is meant to addresses are buttons on third party sites that invite you to share *to* social media sites.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the button in question is a functional button on the 1st party site that provides a feature that is not otherwise easily surfaced. On desktop you can get the short URL by right clicking on the video and in the context menu you can copy the short URL or a URL to the current timestamp. This is not available on mobile. The share button is the only way (that i've been able to find, anyway) that youtube has provided to copy the short url on mobile. They haven't provided, for example, a text box with the short URL in it or anything like that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1783323681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-10-27T18:18:39Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
