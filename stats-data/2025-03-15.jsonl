This issue occurs consistently when the setting is turned on.\r\n> \r\n> #### Steps to Reproduce\r\n> 1. Open **AdGuard** and go to **Settings**.\r\n> 2. Navigate to the **Network** section.\r\n> 3. Enable the **\"Filter HTTPS\"** option.\r\n> 4. Observe that the **Sora and Project folders** disappear.\r\n> \r\n> #### Expected Behavior\r\n> The Sora and Project folders should remain visible and accessible even when **\"Filter HTTPS\"** is enabled.\r\n> \r\n> #### Actual Behavior\r\n> As soon as **\"Filter HTTPS\"** is enabled, the folders disappear.\r\n> \r\n> #### Additional Information\r\n> - **OS Version**: Win 11 pro Build 26100.3476\r\n> - **AdGuard Version**:  7.20.2 (4988)\r\n> \r\n> #### Workaround\r\n> Disabling **\"Filter HTTPS\"** restores the Sora and Project folders, but this is not an ideal solution as HTTPS filtering is needed.  \r\n> Additionally, adding **chatgpt.com** to the **User Filter** does not resolve the issue.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\nUsername: `@AbhishekBasnet`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/56xx3klcg6g4sskwwk0g4kckokwc84cbx8k56apl3s.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/cbyjmyqfh14wgkk0owsg48wk8kcsw44qw02e3hnmfk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.2 (4988)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.26100.0\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | TDI\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nCustom filters: | User rules (url: none)\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Glasswire\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.custom_bootstrap=&dns.custom_fallback=&dns.custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.enabled=false&dns.fallback_mode=System&dns.filters=1&dns.servers=System&dns.timeout=0&extensions=AdGuard%2520Assistant%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fassistant%2F4.3%2Fassistant.user.js%29%2CAdGuard%2520Extra%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29%2CAdGuard%2520Popup%2520Blocker%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fpopup-blocker%2F2.5%2Fpopupblocker.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=2&license_type=paid&product_type=Win&product_version=7.20.2+%284988%29&referrer=&scheme_version=2&stealth.enabled=false&system_version=Microsoft+Windows+NT+10.0.26100.0&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F134.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&utm_campaign=report&utm_medium=assistant&utm_source=win&win.wfp=false)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200851/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-15T07:49:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

These elements can be distracting, slow down page loading, and sometimes contain unwanted or low-quality content. While existing annoyance filters block some of these elements, many still appear on various news sites.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce an additional annoyance filter specifically designed to target and block conversation/comment boxes at the end of news articles. This filter should work across multiple popular news websites and support customization in case users want to whitelist specific sites.\n\n### Additional information\n\nSome common platforms that power these comment sections include Disqus, Facebook Comments, Vuukle, and OpenWeb.\n- Users who prefer engagement can have an option to disable this filter.\n- This would enhance the readability and browsing experience for users who want a cleaner interface.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200324/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200324/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2726298286","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200324#issuecomment-2726298286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200324","id":2726298286,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86igAKu","user":{"login":"DandelionSprout","id":22780683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzgwNjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22780683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout","html_url":"https://github.com/DandelionSprout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-15T07:11:20Z","updated_at":"2025-03-15T07:11:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I greatly approve of this, although I personally have saltier motives for seconding it (That a supermajority of such comment sections contain racism and/or people who couldn't *possibly* have read the articles they're commenting on).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2726298286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-15T07:11:21Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
