(No custom rules added, adguard maintains default settings) I tried uninstalling ublock but no improvement, but when ublock is the only one running it blocks YouTube ads properly.\r\nUsername:

Помогите сменить тему с тёмной на светлую и убрать фон на warhammer40k.fandom.com. Фон получается убрать только статичными фильтрами, но он там переодически по вики меняется, так что они что мёртвому припарка. От тёмной темы по дефолту кровь из глаз течёт (меняется в углу), хочется светлую по дефолту сделать, дабы постоянно не переключать. Знаю, что через adguard можно подобное сделать, но опыта у меня для подобного маловато.

But I have to keep this setting disabled for all sites now rather than just Chase, b/c disabling AG for Chase only doesn't deactivate this setting, and therefore does not circumvent the bug which prevents the site from loading.\r\n\r\nWhat I was trying to clarify before was if this is intended behavior for the setting, or is it supposed to be disabled on sites that are whitelisted?  If the latter, then which other settings remain enabled on whitelisted sites?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1901206146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-19T22:20:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

( [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing#264](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing/issues/264) )\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n> Please check that there no another web browser extension that has adblocking feature is enabled on your web browser. It can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \r\n> Saving memory feature of your web browser or sleep feature of your operating system can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n> In this case, please re-enable AdGuard's filtering by toggling the protection toggle.\r\n> Following the instructions can be needed.\r\n\r\n### The instructions\r\n1.
