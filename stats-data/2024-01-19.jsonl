(No custom rules added, adguard maintains default settings) I tried uninstalling ublock but no improvement, but when ublock is the only one running it blocks YouTube ads properly.\r\nUsername:

Помогите сменить тему с тёмной на светлую и убрать фон на warhammer40k.fandom.com. Фон получается убрать только статичными фильтрами, но он там переодически по вики меняется, так что они что мёртвому припарка. От тёмной темы по дефолту кровь из глаз течёт (меняется в углу), хочется светлую по дефолту сделать, дабы постоянно не переключать. Знаю, что через adguard можно подобное сделать, но опыта у меня для подобного маловато.
