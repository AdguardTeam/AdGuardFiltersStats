These elements can be distracting, slow down page loading, and sometimes contain unwanted or low-quality content. While existing annoyance filters block some of these elements, many still appear on various news sites.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nIntroduce an additional annoyance filter specifically designed to target and block conversation/comment boxes at the end of news articles. This filter should work across multiple popular news websites and support customization in case users want to whitelist specific sites.\n\n### Additional information\n\nSome common platforms that power these comment sections include Disqus, Facebook Comments, Vuukle, and OpenWeb.\n- Users who prefer engagement can have an option to disable this filter.\n- This would enhance the readability and browsing experience for users who want a cleaner interface.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200324/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-09T00:02:36Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
