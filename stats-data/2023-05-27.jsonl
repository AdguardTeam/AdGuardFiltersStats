团队的所有管理员和成员您好。我想自我介绍一下，我是被举报网站的认证作者之一。我在社区中从事的项目涉及创建 iOS 系统快捷方式，用户可以完全免费使用。举报我们的人只是故意散布有关他人的虚假信息的人，过去发生过无数类似案例。在我们圈子里，这个记者已经臭名昭著了。请随时进行彻底调查。需要说明的是，被举报网站完全符合中国法律法规，并已办理必要的注册手续。通过调查，我发现举报人是一名小学生，才十多岁。我恳请你仔细检查此事。谢谢。\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > > >\r\n> > \r\n> >

团队的所有管理员和成员您好。我想自我介绍一下，我是被举报网站的认证作者之一。我在社区中从事的项目涉及创建 iOS 系统快捷方式，用户可以完全免费使用。举报我们的人只是故意散布有关他人的虚假信息的人，过去发生过无数类似案例。在我们圈子里，这个记者已经臭名昭著了。请随时进行彻底调查。需要说明的是，被举报网站完全符合中国法律法规，并已办理必要的注册手续。通过调查，我发现举报人是一名小学生，才十多岁。我恳请你仔细检查此事。谢谢。\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > > \r\n> > \r\n> >
