There is no rule to hide the ad placeholders. On PCs, blocking the script results in a size of zero. However, on iPhones, because the iframe remains, it's natural that the ad frame does not disappear. If there are other causes for this issue, I would appreciate learning about them for future reference.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/gzfk23gfl9ss84sgoswswgos8c8o04s8dchlk3f5jg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178380/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-02T08:13:33Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

This slows down the user's browser. I suspect that this script is either a mining script or an anti-ad blocker measure.\r\n\r\n### Enter the issue address\r\n\r\n[#178228](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178228)\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\n#### If possible, a screenshot of a page or application should not be cropped too much. Otherwise, it is not always clear where the element is located\r\n\r\nThis can be confirmed both on Firefox and Chromium. Blocking this script does not affect website functionality. I tested the basic login and reading (this is a novel website) functions, and everything seems to be working fine.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Screenshot 1:</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/29907700/c8efc467-80e1-4f8a-9810-e100f9975b72)\r\n\r\nThe script is obfuscated and makes a large number of recursive function calls. This can be confirmed using the browser's performance profiler.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not

This PR blocks it.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### To avoid invalid pull requests, please check and confirm following terms\r\n\r\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report;\r\n- [x] My code follows the [guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [x] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [ ] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\n\r\nThis script from Qidian consumes user's CPU and appears to provide no actual functionality. This slows down the user's browser. I suspect that this script is either a mining script or an anti-ad blocker measure.\r\n\r\n### Enter the issue address\r\n\r\n[#178228](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178228)\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\n#### If possible, a screenshot of a page or application should not be cropped too much. Otherwise, it is not always clear where the element is located\r\n\r\nThis can be confirmed both on Firefox and Chromium. Blocking this script does not affect website functionality. I tested the basic login and reading (this is a novel website) functions, and everything seems to be working fine.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Screenshot 1:</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/29907700/c8efc467-80e1-4f8a-9810-e100f9975b72)\r\n\r\nThe script is obfuscated and makes a large number of recursive function calls. This can be confirmed using the browser's performance profiler.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not
