рекламы в приложении ВК, мне ответили, что в приложении нет возможности скрыть рекламу, можно пользоваться ВК через браузер, там не будет рекламы. Зашла ВК  через браузер и что?-как была реклама ,так и осталась. Реклама не только в приложении ВК,но и в других приложениях смартфона. Во всех браузерах  реклама выскакивает, на любой странице.  За что я оплатила пожизненную лицензию?-не понимаю .

name related to the request to upload to volces.com has been banned\n1. Visit the website https://kimi.moonshot.cn/ When using the adguard DNS interception function, there may be a resolution failure, which can be stably replicated on the Windows client\n2. An abnormal resolution occurred while attempting to analyze the nslookup volces.com related domain name, with a response of 0.0.0.0 being an invalid address\n3. Attempted to check the adguard DNS filter rules and found that | | * volces.com has banned the entire domain https://adguard.com/kb/zh-CN/general/ad-filtering/adguard-filters/\nAppeal:\nThis upload action is a legal action. The scope of the volces.com domain name ban is too large and volces.com does not provide services. Can the ban on volces.com be lifted and individual third or fourth level domain names that violate regulations be banned\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/106b9c42-9dad-48f2-b166-38bd80d0de04)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ae22d31-49a5-4fc0-a4f0-f0a79cb43818)\n\n\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197015/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-01-24T10:26:49Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Strangely, the issue disappears only after I completely uninstall the AdGuard software, allowing me to access the website without any problems.\r\n> \r\n> Please note that this doesn't seem to be related to the browser extension itself. I tested it on Firefox, where the AdGuard extension isn't installed, and I still couldn't access the page.\r\n> \r\n> Could you kindly guide me on how to access https://analytics.pinterest.com/ without having to uninstall AdGuard? Your help would be greatly appreciated.\r\nUsername: `@shekhor-bd`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/k9h6ss984hwgokkgcw0wosk0g880sw03hel46pfhq0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bb9rwusr9nsosk8g0k4ow0sg4gsogksftrdc6w5ee8.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.49 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Eset","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196875/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2612796169","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196875#issuecomment-2612796169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196875","id":2612796169,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86bvBsJ","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-24T15:27:08Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T15:27:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@shekhor-bd Maybe you are using AdGuard DNS?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2612796169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-01-24T15:27:10Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
