We paid money for cable, don't get why I have to watch all these ads. These ads were not from a movie that was aired and they are there. No, these ads are the same two ads they play over and over every time there is one of the many adbreaks. One, a wildlife program for the BBC network, And two, an ad for Xfinity, which we already have. In that order, every time! Often! So I downloaded AdGuard. It didn't work, I erased all my cookies and restarted the computer. That didn't work. Then I read that you need to enable it in the browser when you are on the page. So I erased my cookies again and restarted the computer. Then I went to the website and enabled the extension in the browser, before I logged in. I went to the movie I've been trying to watch and the ads were stil there! So clearly your service doesn't work. Soon to be removed from Edge. Oh, and I did download the Windows version to start with, but that didn't work and I moved to the Edge browser extension. Your promises are empty.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/raju0fh8gy8cwws8880ck04s8wwk0wk3sbvrpl6yam.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.17.1 (4709)\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Block Location API, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (30), <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `User rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking\r\nUserscripts: | https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Userscripts/AdguardPopupBlocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js<br>https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Userscripts/AdguardAssistant/4.2/assistant.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.xfinity.com/stream/sat-token.html](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fstream%2Fsat-token.html)\r\nOther extensions used: | Nothing else is on the Edge Browser.\r\n\r\n### Import issue configuration (AdGuard for Windows)\r\n[Import](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=adguard%3Aimport_user_configuration%3F%3Fbrowsing_security.enabled%3Dtrue%26browsing_security.statistics_enabled%3Dtrue%26dns.custom_bootstrap%3D%26dns.custom_fallback%3D%26dns.enabled%3Dtrue%26dns.fallback_mode%3DSystem%26dns.filters%3DUser%2Brules%26dns.filters_enabled%3Dtrue%26dns.servers%3DSystem%26dns.timeout%3D0%26filters%3D2.3.17%26license_type%3Dfree%26parental_control.enabled%3Dfalse%26product_type%3DWin%26product_version%3D7.17.1%2B%25284709%2529%26referrer%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.xfinity.com%252Fstream%252Fsat-token.html%26stealth.DNT%3Dtrue%26stealth.block_third_party_auth%3Dfalse%26stealth.block_trackers%3Dtrue%26stealth.disable_third_party_cache%3Dfalse%26stealth.disable_wap_push_message_routing_service%3Dfalse%26stealth.disable_windows_defender%3Dfalse%26stealth.disable_windows_telemetry%3Dfalse%26stealth.dpi%3Dfalse%26stealth.enabled%3Dtrue%26stealth.flash%3Dfalse%26stealth.hide_search_queries%3Dtrue%26stealth.java%3Dfalse%26stealth.location%3Dtrue%26stealth.push%3Dfalse%26stealth.strip_url%3Dtrue%26stealth.third_party_cookies%3D30%26stealth.turn_off_advertising_id%3Dfalse%26stealth.webrtc%3Dfalse%26stealth.x_client%3Dtrue%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.xfinity.com%252Fstream%252F%26user_agent%3DMozilla%252F5.0%2B%2528Windows%2BNT%2B10.0%253B%2BWin64%253B%2Bx64%2529%2BAppleWebKit%252F537.36%2B%2528KHTML%252C%2Blike%2BGecko%2529%2BChrome%252F126.0.0.0%2BSafari%252F537.36%2BEdg%252F126.0.0.0%26userscripts%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.adguard.com%252Fpublic%252FUserscripts%252FAdguardPopupBlocker%252F2.5%252Fpopupblocker.user.js%252Chttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.adguard.com%252Fpublic%252FUserscripts%252FAdguardAssistant%252F4.2%252Fassistant.user.js%26utm_campaign%3Dreport%26utm_medium%3Dassistant%26utm_source%3Dwin%26win.wfp%3Dtrue)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/181713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/181713/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-19T03:31:03Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

ATTENTION\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.
