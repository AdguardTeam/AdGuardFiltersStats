Comment\r\n> When I search for something, let's say beds, I see Google ads on the top of my page and that's perfectly fine. I want to see the ads on the top of my search results, but I don't want to see the additional ads once I go to a page. However, I can't go to a page because all pages are blocked. Which filter I have to turn of to have all ads block everywhere but not Google ads?\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/661ojckhyxc8wkwsgccc8s80400gcooq2ztpaedaw0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hvfy8y6mct4cscg0c8wgc80c0kg000cmbt8zd3mcis.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v1.11.16\r\nSystem version: | iOS 17\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-25T11:59:26Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> When I search for something, let's say beds, I see Google ads on the top of my page and that's perfectly fine. I want to see the ads on the top of my search results, but I don't want to see the additional ads once I go to a page. However, I can't go to a page because all pages are blocked. Which filter I have to turn of to have all ads block everywhere but not Google ads?\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot

Comment\r\n> When I search for something, let's say beds, I see Google ads on the top of my page and that's perfectly fine. I want to see the ads on the top of my search results, but I don't want to see the additional ads once I go to a page. However, I can't go to a page because all pages are blocked. Which filter I have to turn of to have all ads block everywhere but not Google ads?\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/661ojckhyxc8wkwsgccc8s80400gcooq2ztpaedaw0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hvfy8y6mct4cscg0c8wgc80c0kg000cmbt8zd3mcis.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v1.11.16\r\nSystem version: | iOS 17\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-25T15:41:41Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Switch to VPN profile, vpn profile says IPsec is turned off. When I turn it on, the AdGuard VPN is turned off. When I press connect on AdGuard VPN mobile apps.

Under AdGuard Pro the DNS turns off when I delete the VPN profile in AdGuard Pro. I turn on DNS under AdGuard Pro. To reinstall AdGuard VPN under VPN profile. When I look at VPN profile. It says it’s turned off. When I connect under VPN profile. I go to AdGuard VPN it says it’s disconnect. When I connect it on AdGuard VPN. I look in iPhone settings under VPN profile says AdGuard VPN under iPhone settings VPN profile it says it’s disconnected. \r\n> \r\n> When I press connect on VPN profile, when I look at AdGuard VPN says disconnected.

`capital.it#@##iubenda-cs-banner`: if you don't reject cookies you can't listen to the webradio, so you can't hide it;\r\n\r\n- Added `deejay.it` and `capital.it` to the existing (trusted-) scriptlets to automatically reject cookies;\r\n- Removed `capital.it` from `#%#//scriptlet('trusted-click-element', '.iubenda-cs-visible .iubenda-cs-accept-btn')`: you don't need to accept cookies, you can reject them;\r\n\r\n- Replaced `capital.it#%#//scriptlet('prevent-element-src-loading', 'script', 'static.chartbeat.com/js/chartbeat_brightcove_plugin.js')` with `redirect=noopjs` so uBO users can take advantage of it;\r\n- Added `googletagmanager.com/gtm.js` exception needed to listen to the webradio.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not

Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### To avoid invalid pull requests, please check and confirm following terms\r\n\r\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report;\r\n- [x] My code follows the [guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [ ] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [x] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters

`capital.it#@##iubenda-cs-banner`: if you don't reject cookies you can't listen to the webradio, so you can't hide it;\r\n\r\n- Added `deejay.it` and `capital.it` to the existing (trusted-) scriptlets to automatically reject cookies;\r\n- Removed `capital.it` from `#%#//scriptlet('trusted-click-element', '.iubenda-cs-visible .iubenda-cs-accept-btn')`: you don't need to accept cookies, you can reject them;\r\n\r\n- Replaced `capital.it#%#//scriptlet('prevent-element-src-loading', 'script', 'static.chartbeat.com/js/chartbeat_brightcove_plugin.js')` with `redirect=noopjs` so uBO users can take advantage of it;\r\n- Added `googletagmanager.com/gtm.js` exception needed to listen to the webradio.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are met\r\n\r\n@Alex-302

fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [ ] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [x] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters

`capital.it#@##iubenda-cs-banner`: if you don't reject cookies you can't listen to the webradio, so you can't hide it;\r\n\r\n- Added `deejay.it` and `capital.it` to the existing (trusted-) scriptlets to automatically reject cookies;\r\n- Removed `capital.it` from `#%#//scriptlet('trusted-click-element', '.iubenda-cs-visible .iubenda-cs-accept-btn')`: you don't need to accept cookies, you can reject them;\r\n\r\n- Replaced `capital.it#%#//scriptlet('prevent-element-src-loading', 'script', 'static.chartbeat.com/js/chartbeat_brightcove_plugin.js')` with `redirect=noopjs` so uBO users can take advantage of it;\r\n- Added `googletagmanager.com/gtm.js` exception needed to listen to the webradio.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not

Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### To avoid invalid pull requests, please check and confirm following terms\r\n\r\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report;\r\n- [x] My code follows the [guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [ ] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [x] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters

`capital.it#@##iubenda-cs-banner`: if you don't reject cookies you can't listen to the webradio, so you can't hide it;\r\n\r\n- Added `deejay.it` and `capital.it` to the existing (trusted-) scriptlets to automatically reject cookies;\r\n- Removed `capital.it` from `#%#//scriptlet('trusted-click-element', '.iubenda-cs-visible .iubenda-cs-accept-btn')`: you don't need to accept cookies, you can reject them;\r\n\r\n- Replaced `capital.it#%#//scriptlet('prevent-element-src-loading', 'script', 'static.chartbeat.com/js/chartbeat_brightcove_plugin.js')` with `redirect=noopjs` so uBO users can take advantage of it;\r\n- Added `googletagmanager.com/gtm.js` exception needed to listen to the webradio.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are met\r\n\r\n@Alex-302

Comment\r\n> When I search for something, let's say beds, I see Google ads on the top of my page and that's perfectly fine. I want to see the ads on the top of my search results, but I don't want to see the additional ads once I go to a page. However, I can't go to a page because all pages are blocked. Which filter I have to turn of to have all ads block everywhere but not Google ads?\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/661ojckhyxc8wkwsgccc8s80400gcooq2ztpaedaw0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hvfy8y6mct4cscg0c8wgc80c0kg000cmbt8zd3mcis.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v1.11.16\r\nSystem version: | iOS 17\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-25T16:12:08Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> When I search for something, let's say beds, I see Google ads on the top of my page and that's perfectly fine. I want to see the ads on the top of my search results, but I don't want to see the additional ads once I go to a page. However, I can't go to a page because all pages are blocked. Which filter I have to turn of to have all ads block everywhere but not Google ads?\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/661ojckhyxc8wkwsgccc8s80400gcooq2ztpaedaw0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hvfy8y6mct4cscg0c8wgc80c0kg000cmbt8zd3mcis.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v1.11.16\r\nSystem version: | iOS 17\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1869041414","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169187#issuecomment-1869041414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169187","id":1869041414,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85vZ08G","user":{"login":"jellizaveta","id":91964807,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXtFhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91964807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta","html_url":"https://github.com/jellizaveta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-25T16:12:03Z","updated_at":"2023-12-25T16:12:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After the fix, the link opens fine on my end.
