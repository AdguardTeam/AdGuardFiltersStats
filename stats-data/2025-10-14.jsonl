Tracking filter\" breaks purchasing ebooks on amazon.co.uk.\n\nAs part of the ebook purchase flow, when validating the credit card, there's a request to `https://www.amazon.co.uk/dppui/third-party-redirect?exitUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fgp%2Fdigital%2F ... &c=dbs` that matches the filter above. The credit card doesn't get validated because of the filter and the transaction never completes.
