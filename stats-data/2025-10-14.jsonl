Tracking filter\" breaks purchasing ebooks on amazon.co.uk.\n\nAs part of the ebook purchase flow, when validating the credit card, there's a request to `https://www.amazon.co.uk/dppui/third-party-redirect?exitUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fgp%2Fdigital%2F ... &c=dbs` that matches the filter above. The credit card doesn't get validated because of the filter and the transaction never completes.

ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript.

I missed the link you provided last time for me to check the status of my case. AdGuard support advised that I should simply re-report and make a note of the link you provide next time. In short, when I go online, despite having AdGuard on and all default filters etc. set as usual, and despite everything being up to date, I still have pop-ups appear, including suggestions to sign in to Google (see screenshot), both at google.com and on other pages that allow you to log in with a Google accounts. I also see cookie pop-ups every time I log in to websites that never used to show them, e.g. Oxford Dictionaries Premium (see screenshot)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/lbdp5nyhrps880g0gokgcc08ocgkc0sf27n2mqma00.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/51swfo3npgso0w0wcc40480csg408c07t0tsqlm088.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.22\r\nSystem version: | `Mac OS 26.0.1 `\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3402314854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-14T15:03:21Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Реклама в приложении для оплаты ЖКХ \"Платосфера\", не помогает даже включение HTTPS-фильтрации для этого приложения, изначально HTTPS-фильтрация была для, него отключена, так как указано, что она может нарушить работу приложения. После включения HTTPS-фильирации реклама вида как на первом скриншоте пропала, но на следующий день снова появилась и больше не уходит, несмотря на то, что HTTPS-фильирация не отключалась. Реклама из второго скриншота (квадратные плитки вверху приложения) вообще не пропадала даже в первый день. Отловить эту рекламу в Adguard DNS Personal вручную мне не удалось, кроме того, у меня там установлены все фильтры без пометки \"problematic\" за исключением HaGeZi's URL Shortener Blocklist, HaGeZi's Allowlist Referral, HaGeZi's Anti-Piracy Blocklist, No Google, ShadowWhisperer's Dating List, но это тоже не сработало.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @Symbiote2099\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n
