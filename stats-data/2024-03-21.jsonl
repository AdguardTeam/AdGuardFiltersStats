There is no specific rule in place to hide the ad placeholder. On PC, blocking the script reduces the size to 0, effectively hiding the ad frame. However, on iPhone, the iframe remains visible, which is why it's expected that the ad frame does not disappear. If there are any other reasons contributing to this behavior, please let me know for future reference.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/glousjammw0gk080ww8sso8w0s48ss8sbi8qyw6les.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175392/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-21T04:57:37Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Ok, thanks for checking!\r\n\r\nhello alex sorry but it seems like I made a mistake i was running a vpn while i was trying your solution this morning but when i disabled it the ads starting to come out again but with no time restrictions for 120 sec like this screenshot\r\n\r\n  ![image](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/22161118/7309a3f8-2bf9-44ea-9bf0-21b015894946) \r\n  \r\n  but like this one \r\n\r\n![Untitled](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/22161118/ed4b4e91-5508-4608-a6e4-b41dadd36d66)\r\n\r\nit's look like the ads has injected in the mp4 file because i downloaded it (no audio for piracy protection) and the ads downloaded with it locally like this \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/22161118/418559e9-ae3b-418a-bf64-701064b6466d)\r\n\r\nthe real video is displaying but it's time is increased by the time of ads like this\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/22161118/ec77586d-1ec6-4c5c-a6cb-961e2a6c7961)\r\n\r\n\r\nthen i decided to make deep testing \r\n\r\nand tried this (with two vpns***two times for each) with and without this new filter enabled or disabled in filters editor from (base filter) (i removed the user filter after base filter updated and found the filter and disabled it) then the wonder thing the ads just vanished even if i have disabled this filter.\r\ni think it's an egyption global ip list related thing for pishing ads for just this list of my country\r\n\r\nwhen getting back from virtual network i get the ads again just like any condition of the filter enable or disable (photo 1,2 )\r\n\r\nplease give me your advice for it to solve and if the har file is useful for it take a look\r\n\r\nsorry for this long explain and hope iam not buzzring you\r\n\r\nthanks in advance\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2011864045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-21T10:27:55Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

issue is caused by Adguard on iPhone's inability to handle iframes properly. There is no specific rule in place to hide the ad placeholder. On PC, blocking the script reduces the size to 0, effectively hiding the ad frame. However, on iPhone, the iframe remains visible, which is why it's expected that the ad frame does not disappear. If there are any other reasons contributing to this behavior, please let me know for future reference.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/glousjammw0gk080ww8sso8w0s48ss8sbi8qyw6les.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175392/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-21T12:48:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I can confirm that adblocking works with https filtering enabled and also no user rules are needed. \r\n\r\nSorry, I definitely should have stated that I had disabled https filtering a while back because of issues I was having with some apps not working with it enabled. I went back through the reporting prompts to make sure I didn't miss a question about https filtering but I didn't see one. Maybe this is a question that should be added to the report prompts asked before an issue is created? I feel like it could save a lot of trouble.\r\n\r\nRegardless, thank you both for your help.

When I turned on the adguard, the domain request seems to be blocked.\r\nIn safari, I think we need to block the pop-up in another way.\r\nSo there was no problem with Chrome and firefox, but I think it was a problem because the filter worked differently in Safari.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardForSafari/blob/master/ElectronMainApp/filters/2.txt\">Filters that are only problematic in Safari</a>\r\n\r\n2.

up, as a test I completely uninstalled adguard for mac and the adguard assistant extension for Safari.

adshield in apkmirror.\r\nSo, after checking the adshield domain, I checked that popup filter works differently in safari.\r\nI made an exception to the shield pop-up filter and it worked well. When I turned on the adguard, the domain request seems to be blocked.\r\nIn safari, I think we need to block the pop-up in another way.\r\nSo there was no problem with Chrome and firefox, but I think it was a problem because the filter worked differently in Safari.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardForSafari/blob/master/ElectronMainApp/filters/2.txt\">Filters that are only problematic in Safari</a>\r\n\r\n2.
