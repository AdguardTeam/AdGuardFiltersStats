Creating the pull request\r\n\r\n> Please include a summary of the change and which issue is fixed\\\r\n> If the related issue does not exist in our repository, please create it before making pull request\\\r\n> It is highly recommended to use our [Web Reporting Tool](https://kb.adguard.com/technical-support/reporting-tool) instead of creating an issue on GitHub directly\\\r\n> Please note, that we verify every pull request manually, so it may take time to apply it\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### To avoid invalid pull requests, please check and confirm following terms\r\n\r\n- [X] This is not an ad/bug report;\r\n- [X] My code follows the [guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [X] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [X] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [X] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [ ] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\n\r\n### Enter the issue address\r\n\r\nFix #210426\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\nThe website owner actively employs anti-adblock countermeasures by frequently changing function names and variable names to bypass ad blockers. Historical evidence shows function name mutations like: `getCookie` → `checkCK` → `checkCookie` → `checkC00kie` → `checkCoookie` → `checkCookiiiie`\r\n\r\nSo I add three complementary rules to ensure robust ad-blocking.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/axutongxue/axutongxue.github.io/commit/9652783a7e86baeec2a83a13a1891515f042773f\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [X] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are met\r\n","created_at":"2025-07-31T00:56:34Z","updated_at":"2025-08-04T05:53:55Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"63ffa1314f4bd88f1b7fdd6f750383dc02fe7d74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":762659576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NjI2NTk1NzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/A:%20In%20progress","name":"A:
