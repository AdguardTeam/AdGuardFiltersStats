Creating the pull request\r\n\r\n> Please include a summary of the change and which issue is fixed\\\r\n> If the related issue does not exist in our repository, please create it before making pull request\\\r\n> It is highly recommended to use our [Web Reporting Tool](https://kb.adguard.com/technical-support/reporting-tool) instead of creating an issue on GitHub directly\\\r\n> Please note, that we verify every pull request manually, so it may take time to apply it\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### To avoid invalid pull requests, please check and confirm following terms\r\n\r\n- [X] This is not an ad/bug report;\r\n- [X] My code follows the [guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [X] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [X] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [X] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [ ] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\n\r\n### Enter the issue address\r\n\r\nFix #210426\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\nThe website owner actively employs anti-adblock countermeasures by frequently changing function names and variable names to bypass ad blockers. Historical evidence shows function name mutations like: `getCookie` → `checkCK` → `checkCookie` → `checkC00kie` → `checkCoookie` → `checkCookiiiie`\r\n\r\nSo I add three complementary rules to ensure robust ad-blocking.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/axutongxue/axutongxue.github.io/commit/9652783a7e86baeec2a83a13a1891515f042773f\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [X] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are met\r\n","created_at":"2025-07-31T00:56:34Z","updated_at":"2025-08-04T05:53:55Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"63ffa1314f4bd88f1b7fdd6f750383dc02fe7d74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":762659576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NjI2NTk1NzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/labels/A:%20In%20progress","name":"A:

ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript. ( [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing#264](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing/issues/264) )\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Please check that there no another web browser extension that has adblocking feature is enabled on your web browser. It can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> Saving memory feature of your web browser or sleep feature of your operating system can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n> In this case, please re-enable AdGuard's filtering by toggling the protection toggle.\n> Following the instructions can be needed.\n\n### The instructions\n1.

Plays content immediately when changing wifi to my phone hot spot or changing this dns on my router, but they have changed something on their side that this dns blocks and it is preventing content from loading. It's some kind of ad that plays before their content, even with paid subscriptions. Please look into this so I can keep using this dns. This issue is also all over reddit, but not necessarily with your DNS. I also tried numerous other dns options that block ads and none allowed this content to play. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/78qih2ct9c0040800ogo8swogsosw48d7sf6mewaag.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/sp6nlpq7p40k0sk4w4s88wcggsw040gfyw76xavxtk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Asus AC2900`\r\nBrowser: | n/a","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-08-04T14:56:22Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://paramountplus.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fparamountplus.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> No way to submit ticket without pictures and the issue only happens on roku, which I didn't take pictures of, but after much troubleshooting i've narrowed it down to this dns blocking content on the paramount plus app via roku. Plays content immediately when changing wifi to my phone hot spot or changing this dns on my router, but they have changed something on their side that this dns blocks and it is preventing content from loading. It's some kind of ad that plays before their content, even with paid subscriptions. Please look into this so I can keep using this dns. This issue is also all over reddit, but not necessarily with your DNS. I also tried numerous other dns options that block ads and none allowed this content to play. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/78qih2ct9c0040800ogo8swogsosw48d7sf6mewaag.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/sp6nlpq7p40k0sk4w4s88wcggsw040gfyw76xavxtk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Asus AC2900`\r\nBrowser: | n/a","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3151257719","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678#issuecomment-3151257719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210678","id":3151257719,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM8671GB3","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-04T15:32:19Z","updated_at":"2025-08-04T15:32:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We don't have Roku.
