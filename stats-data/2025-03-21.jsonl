ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.

removing social sharing buttons AdGuard removes the website's built-in \"Add to favorites\" button. This is not a social sharing button. It basicaly lets users save to favorites, just like the \"Save\" button on reddit.\n\nIt's not only reactor.cc but the whole family of these sites running on the same engine: reactor.cc, jrproxy.com, jr-proxy.com, joyreactor.cc, and pornreactor.cc.\n\n\nI'd assume the filter blocks something like `.share_buttons` but it should be `.share_buttons > a`, or even `.share_buttons > :not(.favorite_link)`\n\nAnd I think currenlty AdGuard does not block these components on pornreactor.cc so it would be nice to have it included in the filters too.\n\n2.

This is not a social sharing button. It basicaly lets users save to favorites, just like the \"Save\" button on reddit.\n\nIt's not only reactor.cc but the whole family of these sites running on the same engine: reactor.cc, jrproxy.com, jr-proxy.com, joyreactor.cc, and pornreactor.cc.\n\n\nI'd assume the filter blocks something like `.share_buttons` but it should be `.share_buttons > a`, or even `.share_buttons > :not(.favorite_link)`\n\nAnd I think currenlty AdGuard does not block these components on pornreactor.cc so it would be nice to have it included in the filters too.\n\n2.
