I use a VPN server running on localhost which disables ads by DNS injection (basically all ad sites are routed to 0.0.0.0, this disables ads on most sites improving my internet experience). This along with uBlock origin gives a really clean experience on my phone. A temporary workaround for me is to use CloudFlare or Google's DNS servers. This doesn't make any difference to me as I have a separate blocklist as well which disables ad sites as well as inappropriate sites which are not included by AdGuard DNS\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158457/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-07T01:18:50Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I use a VPN server running on localhost which disables ads by DNS injection (basically all ad sites are routed to 0.0.0.0, this disables ads on most sites improving my internet experience). This along with uBlock origin gives a really clean experience on my phone. A temporary workaround for me is to use CloudFlare or Google's DNS servers. This doesn't make any difference to me as I have a separate blocklist as well which disables ad sites as well as inappropriate sites which are not included by AdGuard DNS\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158457/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158457/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1667705336","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158457#issuecomment-1667705336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158457","id":1667705336,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85jZyn4","user":{"login":"thunder-coding","id":68849076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODQ5MDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68849076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunder-coding","html_url":"https://github.com/thunder-coding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunder-coding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunder-coding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunder-coding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunder-coding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunder-coding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunder-coding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunder-coding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunder-coding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunder-coding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-07T11:45:57Z","updated_at":"2023-08-07T11:45:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> The site has been removed from parental control lists, an update will be available within 1-2 hours.\n\nJust out of curiosity, you guys aren't releasing your DNS server blocklist unlike client side blocks?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1667705336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-07T11:45:58Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I use a VPN server running on localhost which disables ads by DNS injection (basically all ad sites are routed to 0.0.0.0, this disables ads on most sites improving my internet experience). This along with uBlock origin gives a really clean experience on my phone. A temporary workaround for me is to use CloudFlare or Google's DNS servers. This doesn't make any difference to me as I have a separate blocklist as well which disables ad sites as well as inappropriate sites which are not included by AdGuard DNS\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158457/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158457/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1667770493","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158457#issuecomment-1667770493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158457","id":1667770493,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85jaCh9","user":{"login":"jellizaveta","id":91964807,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXtFhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91964807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta","html_url":"https://github.com/jellizaveta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-07T12:31:21Z","updated_at":"2023-08-07T12:31:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There are no separate block lists for parental controls or phishing.

Is there anything I can do to appeal?\r\n\r\nIf anyone could please inform me it be very helpful because I actually pay for Adguard. I'm on the premium on my phone and well if i am suspended permanently or something and can't get any more technical support with your app, well i need to know so that I know, it's nothing personal!\r\nno hard feelings end my subscription and fine another adblock team that hopfully i wont have caused infractors with if i have caused any with you guys!\r\n\r\n2.
