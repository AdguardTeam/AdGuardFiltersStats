I use a VPN server running on localhost which disables ads by DNS injection (basically all ad sites are routed to 0.0.0.0, this disables ads on most sites improving my internet experience). This along with uBlock origin gives a really clean experience on my phone. A temporary workaround for me is to use CloudFlare or Google's DNS servers. This doesn't make any difference to me as I have a separate blocklist as well which disables ad sites as well as inappropriate sites which are not included by AdGuard DNS\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158457/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-07T01:18:50Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
