I use a VPN server running on localhost which disables ads by DNS injection (basically all ad sites are routed to 0.0.0.0, this disables ads on most sites improving my internet experience). This along with uBlock origin gives a really clean experience on my phone. A temporary workaround for me is to use CloudFlare or Google's DNS servers. This doesn't make any difference to me as I have a separate blocklist as well which disables ad sites as well as inappropriate sites which are not included by AdGuard DNS\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158457/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-07T01:18:50Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Problem can be reproduced as follows:\r\n> \r\n> (1) Go to Google.de\r\n> (2) Enter \"Google Maps\"\r\n> (3) Choose the first result (google.de/maps/preview)\r\n> \r\n> The second search result (https://www.google.com/maps/?hl=de) takes me go Google Maps without a nag screen (no google consent nag screen), but the google consent nag screen pops up when you follow the first search result (google.de/maps/preview). The filter lists regarding google consent probably work flawlessly with google.com, but they do not seem to work with google.de.\r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/39netu1h0facwwsg4cgskwso48kwwgk2x69pck2rfg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/158458/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-07T01:47:55Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
