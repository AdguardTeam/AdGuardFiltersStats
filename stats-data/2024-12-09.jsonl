dopiskiem \"Sponsorowane\", co jakiś czas reklamuje coś innego. Warto wspomnieć, że niedawno zmieniłem oprogramowanie antywirusowe z Kasperskiego na ESET i wtedy zacząłem widzieć ten banner/belkę. Kasperski miał lepsze rozszerzenie do przeglądarki, którego jedną z dodatkowych, opcjonalnych funkcji było wycinanie bannerów reklamowych i po prostu naturalnie uzupełniał  ewentualne braki w filtrach AdGuarda. ESET niestety nie posiada takiej ekstra funkcji stąd moja prośba o dodanie stosownej reguły w odpowiednim filtrze. Dziękuję i pozdrawiam!\r\nUsername: `@caleb59`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/7qqhayx8pm8skkokcwg4w440o0cc0oga4rebz1hp4o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.19.0 (4853)\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11, wersja 24H2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://dns.adguard-dns.com`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`, `User DNS filter (url: none)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>KAD - Anti-Scam, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nCustom filters: | User filter (url: none)\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | ESET Internet Security 18.0.12.0\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=true&clid=xCeJ0S--vcEUqE&custom_filters=User%2520filter%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.custom_bootstrap=&dns.custom_fallback=&dns.custom_filters=User%2520DNS%2520filter%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_mode=System&dns.filters=15&dns.servers=quic%3A%2F%2Fdns.adguard-dns.com&dns.timeout=0&extensions=AdGuard%2520Extra%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29%2CAdGuard%2520Popup%2520Blocker%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fpopup-blocker%2F2.5%2Fpopupblocker.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=2.3.4.14.216.232.238&license_type=paid&product_type=Win&product_version=7.19.0+%284853%29&referrer=&scheme_version=2&stealth.enabled=false&system_version=Microsoft+Windows+NT+10.0.26100.0&url=https%3A%2F%2Fallegro.pl%2F&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F131.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&utm_campaign=report&utm_medium=assistant&utm_source=win&win.wfp=true)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/194223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/194223/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-12-09T07:04:32Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
