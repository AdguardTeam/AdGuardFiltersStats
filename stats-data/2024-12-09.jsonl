dopiskiem \"Sponsorowane\", co jakiś czas reklamuje coś innego. Warto wspomnieć, że niedawno zmieniłem oprogramowanie antywirusowe z Kasperskiego na ESET i wtedy zacząłem widzieć ten banner/belkę. Kasperski miał lepsze rozszerzenie do przeglądarki, którego jedną z dodatkowych, opcjonalnych funkcji było wycinanie bannerów reklamowych i po prostu naturalnie uzupełniał  ewentualne braki w filtrach AdGuarda. ESET niestety nie posiada takiej ekstra funkcji stąd moja prośba o dodanie stosownej reguły w odpowiednim filtrze. Dziękuję i pozdrawiam!\r\nUsername: `@caleb59`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/7qqhayx8pm8skkokcwg4w440o0cc0oga4rebz1hp4o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.19.0 (4853)\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11, wersja 24H2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://dns.adguard-dns.com`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`, `User DNS filter (url: none)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>KAD - Anti-Scam, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nCustom filters: | User filter (url: none)\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | ESET Internet Security 18.0.12.0\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=true&clid=xCeJ0S--vcEUqE&custom_filters=User%2520filter%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.custom_bootstrap=&dns.custom_fallback=&dns.custom_filters=User%2520DNS%2520filter%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_mode=System&dns.filters=15&dns.servers=quic%3A%2F%2Fdns.adguard-dns.com&dns.timeout=0&extensions=AdGuard%2520Extra%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29%2CAdGuard%2520Popup%2520Blocker%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fpopup-blocker%2F2.5%2Fpopupblocker.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=2.3.4.14.216.232.238&license_type=paid&product_type=Win&product_version=7.19.0+%284853%29&referrer=&scheme_version=2&stealth.enabled=false&system_version=Microsoft+Windows+NT+10.0.26100.0&url=https%3A%2F%2Fallegro.pl%2F&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F131.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&utm_campaign=report&utm_medium=assistant&utm_source=win&win.wfp=true)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/194223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/194223/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-12-09T07:04:32Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

The latest rule in uBO is receiving mixed feedback at least on Brave, so I changed to https://listauthorschat.slack.com/archives/C010N14G4TF/p1723225777981599?thread_ts=1683754186.016929&cid=C010N14G4TF which is more time-tested. Tested with Chrome ext 4.4.22 the rule is working fine on my end. I'm not sure about the `replace` rule for Firefox, in particular why `\\$2` escape is needed.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private

Google, Cloudflare or our provider’s own DNS resolves this just fine but of course does no filtering.\r\n>  \r\n> What has to be done with your services to have this blocking removed (if it can be of course)\r\n>  \r\n> I am not an employee of webpower.eu but this company is used for marketing and enquete mails as a forwarder so if they are blacklisted or do malicious stuff I need to know so I can either clear it up with them or we switch to a reliable company.\r\n>  \r\n> Many thanks in advance for your support !\r\n>  \r\n> Best Regards,\r\n>  \r\n> Werner Van den bosch\r\n> `wernervandenbosch@telenet.be`\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\nUsername: `I do not have one ? use my email wernervandenbosch@telenet.be`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6sjgirenjy0w40c0s0wk4cs0w8w40sk2or724iw60m.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ef1cccsm4cg0wk40kccwok8s8ww0o8wf4rwm2wshtw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | TPLink Archer (but also others, it's DNS ...)\r\nBrowser: | Chrome","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/194348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/194348/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-12-09T12:46:42Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Ostatnio, kiedy go używałem był całkowicie włączony i takiego monitu nie było. Dopiero teraz od wczoraj mi się pokamazuje. Nie jest on non-stop, można go zamknąć, ale jak by nie było, to wyskakuje podczas oglądania TV. Strona jest legalna. Siec która go nadaje jest tez legalna\r\nUsername: `@Andrzej`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/s69qdbatfu8sssgssowc484skssokog1ae3vcsnobx.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.48 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nOther extensions used: |  Malwarebytes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/194200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/194200/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2528054657","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/194200#issuecomment-2528054657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/194200","id":2528054657,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86Wrw2B","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-09T14:04:24Z","updated_at":"2024-12-09T14:04:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/194200#issuecomment-2525211178 - W ustawieniach AdGuarda włącz proszę listę `AdGuard Popups filter`/`Filtr Popupów AdGuard` (https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/194200#issuecomment-2523341325), a potem sprawdź proszę, czy problem nadal występuje.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2528054657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-12-09T14:04:26Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
