This enables projects to better maintain and deduplicate their own transitive dependencies while not requiring direct updates to <em>lint-staged</em>. This was changed in <a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/releases/tag/v16.2.0\">16.2.0</a> after the vulnerability issues with <code>chalk</code> and <code>debug</code>, which were also removed in the same version.</p>\n<p>Given the recent vulnerabilities in the <em>npm</em> ecosystem, it's best to be very careful when updating dependencies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v16.2.0</h2>\n<h3>Minor Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/pull/1615\">#1615</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/commit/99eb74200e8db69e72dba45314025953b8b0794e\"><code>99eb742</code></a> Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/iiroj\"><code>@​iiroj</code></a>! - Added a new option <code>--fail-on-changes</code> to make <em>lint-staged</em> exit with code 1 when tasks modify any files, making the <code>precommit</code> hook fail. This is similar to the <code>git diff --exit-code</code> option. Using this flag also implies the <code>--no-revert</code> flag which means any changes made by tasks will be left in the working tree after failing, so that they can be manually staged and the commit tried again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/pull/1611\">#1611</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/commit/cd05fd349594baf586fbafb05588ff07d86060b7\"><code>cd05fd3</code></a> Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/rlorenzo\"><code>@​rlorenzo</code></a>! - Added a new option <code>--continue-on-error</code> so that <em>lint-staged</em> will run all tasks to completion even if some of them fail.

The changes will be applied back after running the tasks. Note that the combination of flags <code>--hide-unstaged --no-hide-partially-staged</code> isn't meaningful and behaves the same as just <code>--hide-unstaged</code>.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/ItsNickBarry\"><code>@​ItsNickBarry</code></a> for the idea and initial implementation in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/pull/1552\">#1552</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/pull/1648\">#1648</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/commit/7900b3b79c5e2e69662cb8b1bcbcae79c3549421\"><code>7900b3b</code></a> Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/iiroj\"><code>@​iiroj</code></a>! - Remove <a href=\"https://github.com/antonk52/lilconfig\">lilconfig</a> to reduce reliance on third-party dependencies.

For example, loading the list of prescriptions on file (“we encountered a problem please reload to try again”), or, when using the site/service’s address based search feature to find the pharmacy with my prescriptions on-file: the site will return a correct list of nearby locations but, no matter which I select, the same incorrect location ends up being chosen and displayed on the next screen.\r\n> \r\n> Shoppers Drug Mart and their parent company are notoriously evil and data hungry.

In attempting to reproduce this issue using an iPhone, I took care with the following matters:\r\n> I cleared Safari’s cache.\r\n> I ensured no extensions other than AdGuard were enabled.\r\n> I powered off the iPhone and then restarted it.\r\n> In Safari settings, I disabled all content blockers and then re-enabled them.\r\n> After that, I restarted Safari.\r\n> I also restarted AdGuard, and checked for filter updates in AdGuard. During the filter update, I kept the AdGuard window open for two minutes.\r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/fqwgbh4dbegwo04kckg4k0owwc4844crud17mrhles.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.12\r\nSystem version: | `iOS 18.6.1`\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query `<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3347829408","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214437#issuecomment-3347829408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214437","id":3347829408,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87Hi9Kg","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-29T16:02:22Z","updated_at":"2025-09-29T16:02:22Z","body":"<img width=\"1704\" height=\"1088\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/346a8405-fb4b-4223-862d-3b35131c2d32\" />\n\nCan't reproduce on iPad or on desktop with iOS user agent.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3347829408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-09-29T16:02:23Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

This issue concerns the promotion of X’s mobile app appearing when opening a post in a browser.\r\n> \r\n> I’ve confirmed reproduction on iOS Safari and Windows Chrome (with the user agent set to iPhone). \r\n> Considering the possibility of geographical dependency, I tested with IP addresses from the US, Norway, Japan, Germany, and Israel, and confirmed it reproduces.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\n> In attempting to reproduce this issue using an iPhone, I took care with the following matters:\r\n> I cleared Safari’s cache.\r\n> I ensured no extensions other than AdGuard were enabled.\r\n> I powered off the iPhone and then restarted it.\r\n> In Safari settings, I disabled all content blockers and then re-enabled them.\r\n> After that, I restarted Safari.\r\n> I also restarted AdGuard, and checked for filter updates in AdGuard. During the filter update, I kept the AdGuard window open for two minutes.\r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/fqwgbh4dbegwo04kckg4k0owwc4844crud17mrhles.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.12\r\nSystem version: | `iOS 18.6.1`\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query `<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3347970993","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214437#issuecomment-3347970993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214437","id":3347970993,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87Hjfux","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-29T16:32:08Z","updated_at":"2025-09-29T16:32:08Z","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Annoyance)\r\n [https://mobile.x.com/i/status/1858899697147986315](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmobile.x.com%2Fi%2Fstatus%2F1858899697147986315)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/gftc6cp0x5sk0w4g4ocok4c8oowoo8wupahg4wjnbk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.2.80 \r\nSystem version: | `Windows 11`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?product_type=ext&product_version=5.2.80&system_version=Windows+11&browser=chrome&filters=2.3.4.11.14.17&browsing_security.enabled=false&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=false&stealth.enabled=false)","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3347970993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-09-29T16:32:09Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

This issue concerns the promotion of X’s mobile app appearing when opening a post in a browser.\r\n> \r\n> I’ve confirmed reproduction on iOS Safari and Windows Chrome (with the user agent set to iPhone). \r\n> Considering the possibility of geographical dependency, I tested with IP addresses from the US, Norway, Japan, Germany, and Israel, and confirmed it reproduces.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\n> In attempting to reproduce this issue using an iPhone, I took care with the following matters:\r\n> I cleared Safari’s cache.\r\n> I ensured no extensions other than AdGuard were enabled.\r\n> I powered off the iPhone and then restarted it.\r\n> In Safari settings, I disabled all content blockers and then re-enabled them.\r\n> After that, I restarted Safari.\r\n> I also restarted AdGuard, and checked for filter updates in AdGuard. During the filter update, I kept the AdGuard window open for two minutes.\r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/fqwgbh4dbegwo04kckg4k0owwc4844crud17mrhles.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.12\r\nSystem version: | `iOS 18.6.1`\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query `<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/214437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-09-29T16:32:08Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
