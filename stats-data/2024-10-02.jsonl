Not only the translator but also the stock graph 1 year 5 year maximum period buttons that can be used in Google's main search do not work. When you hit a certain store, the results are displayed on the map. When you click on the store, it should get bigger and show more detailed information, but that doesn't work either.\r\n> \r\n>  For some reason, many of the features available in the main Google search do not work.

Comment\r\n> Although adguard filtered properly in the past, for two days  now ads (probably coming from outbrain, see below) are not filtered anymore in the \"Spiegel\" app. Besides the ads I have
