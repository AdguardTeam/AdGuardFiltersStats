Теперь снова и список писем отображается нормально и даже рекламного баннера нет и даже остатков от него. На сколько опять только хватит этой новой правки непонятно конечно. Я уже на такое и не расчитывал, был уже согласен и остатки от рекламного баннера чтобы были лишь бы не ломался полезный функционал сайта. Если что я снова напишу в этой задаче тогда, но надеюсь что на этот раз хватит надолго. Мне просто уже и перед Вами неудобно. Но и не сообщить здесь Вам об этом снова я в этот раз не мог, поскольку одно дело остатки от рекламы если отображаются и совсем другое дело если с AdGuard ломается полезный функционал сайта. Если с первым (тем более в пользу исправления второго) можно и смириться, то второе никак нельзя оставлять без внимания. Ещё раз спасибо. Всего Вам доброго.
