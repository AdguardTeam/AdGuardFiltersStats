Теперь снова и список писем отображается нормально и даже рекламного баннера нет и даже остатков от него. На сколько опять только хватит этой новой правки непонятно конечно. Я уже на такое и не расчитывал, был уже согласен и остатки от рекламного баннера чтобы были лишь бы не ломался полезный функционал сайта. Если что я снова напишу в этой задаче тогда, но надеюсь что на этот раз хватит надолго. Мне просто уже и перед Вами неудобно. Но и не сообщить здесь Вам об этом снова я в этот раз не мог, поскольку одно дело остатки от рекламы если отображаются и совсем другое дело если с AdGuard ломается полезный функционал сайта. Если с первым (тем более в пользу исправления второго) можно и смириться, то второе никак нельзя оставлять без внимания. Ещё раз спасибо. Всего Вам доброго.

thank you for your prompt response, it's great that problems are solved almost instantly. I understand that this is the solution to my problem, but I still think that it does not solve the main problem of erroneous blocking of this resource. do you have the opportunity to transfer information or update this filter list so that the root site is not blocked, because it really does not contain any advertising? I believe that this is the only way to solve the given errors: the triggering of your wonderful software in other cases, disabling this list opens access to other unwanted advertising to me. I understand how difficult it is to change filters and adjust anything, but I hope that you will be able to change this, fix the erroneous blocking of this resource. I also guess why these changes could have been added, and this resource has become undesirable, this is an erroneous change of the pathamushta there is nothing on the resource itself, the pratevo speech is a resource to create. the resource itself is not an advertising one and may have been added due to the fact that it was used as an advertisement somewhere, but I consider it erroneous to add a resource based on this principle. I hope for your understanding and a different solution to this situation, I do not want to disable filters, as this will reduce the already small number of blocked resources on the ios operating system. the site itself, as you probably already guessed, is a simple link reduction service, it allows you to shorten the link, use the site for redirection, but if we add such sites to the list of undesirable ones, then how can we block half of the Internet resources? I do not believe that the service of short ural addresses should have reasons for blocking just because somewhere to use the link for undesirable and selfish purposes, including to display unwanted advertising, the resource itself should actively take action.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2160901359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-11T14:24:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
