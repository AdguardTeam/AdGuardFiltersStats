not being able to distinguish the two and is mistaking the embedded video with the embedded ads as an ad it’s self. Is there anyway this can be resolved of separating the line of code of the ads and the line of code that make up the video so only the line of code that makes up the ads is blocked so that I can still view the video?2. \r\n\r\n\r\nHere is video url links to certain videos on gaypornhdfree.com that I have no access to as long as adguard keeps blocking them as ads \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://gaypornhdfree.com/giuspel-favio-vador-behind-the-scenes-in-the-park/\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://gaypornhdfree.com/ethan-chase-ridick/\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://gaypornhdfree.com/nikita-repa-spanking-2/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart of me is worried if any of you attempt this could it jeopardize what has already been in state of gaypornhdfree no longer detecting my adblocker???\r\n\r\n3.
