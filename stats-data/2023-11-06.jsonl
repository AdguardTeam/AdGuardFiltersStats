episode, an in-page pop-up ad-image appears in front of the screen. Though this issue can be resolved through updating the AdGuard filters, but the issue will return after a couple of months, even with the Fanboy Annoyance filter enabled, the filter that is designed to remove these in-page pop-ups. Though there was no issue until tone of the streaming servers got an update and name rebranding this issue returned, though I found a way to fix it and I thought I had resolved the issue, it reappeared again yesterday.\r\n> Like what is the issue here? How is this one in-page pop+up ad-image bypassing the AdGuard filter that is specifically designed to remove this type of annoyance?\r\nUsername: `@Ian Chen`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ekqb1l6zgrso88g0csg4koos4wgs0s84owqm66x44k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.0\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `192.168.68.84`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nOther extensions used: | Fanboy’s Annoyance","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/165548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/165548/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1794297145","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/165548#issuecomment-1794297145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/165548","id":1794297145,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85q8s05","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-06T08:24:20Z","updated_at":"2023-11-06T08:24:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Should be already fixed in https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/commit/283f82eb3a1ab2aa114a62bd6d36d783416f1d95\r\nPlease update filters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1794297145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-06T08:24:22Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

episode, an in-page pop-up ad-image appears in front of the screen. Though this issue can be resolved through updating the AdGuard filters, but the issue will return after a couple of months, even with the Fanboy Annoyance filter enabled, the filter that is designed to remove these in-page pop-ups. Though there was no issue until tone of the streaming servers got an update and name rebranding this issue returned, though I found a way to fix it and I thought I had resolved the issue, it reappeared again yesterday.\r\n> Like what is the issue here? How is this one in-page pop+up ad-image bypassing the AdGuard filter that is specifically designed to remove this type of annoyance?\r\nUsername: `@Ian Chen`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ekqb1l6zgrso88g0csg4koos4wgs0s84owqm66x44k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.0\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `192.168.68.84`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nOther extensions used: | Fanboy’s Annoyance","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/165548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/165548/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-06T08:24:22Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
