рекламы в приложении ВК, мне ответили, что в приложении нет возможности скрыть рекламу, можно пользоваться ВК через браузер, там не будет рекламы. Зашла ВК  через браузер и что?-как была реклама ,так и осталась. Реклама не только в приложении ВК,но и в других приложениях смартфона. Во всех браузерах  реклама выскакивает, на любой странице.  За что я оплатила пожизненную лицензию?-не понимаю .
