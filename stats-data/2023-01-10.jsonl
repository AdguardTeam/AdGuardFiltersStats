After using Adguard For Windows for the first time, things were going good until several versions ago after an update, after that, I started having YouTube ads get through sometimes randomly about every day, and I was not the only one.\r\n> \r\n> Eventually, I reported it through the Adguard support page, Adguard Forums, and through the support option in Adguard For Windows, and I went back & forth with support trying to troubleshoot the issue.\r\n> \r\n> I tried uninstalling & reinstalling, updating, changing DNS between Adguard & Quad9, with & without security web browser extensions, et cetera, and the longest it worked without happening is maybe two or three days.\r\n> \r\n> Support had me send logs and advanced logs when ever this would happen, eventually I was told that it was a filter issue with Adguard, and that I would have to report it myself here; for some reason they could not send all the information I had already submitted themselves.\r\n> \r\n> I decided to uninstall Adguard & use Ublock Origin for a little while, I had no issues with that, eventually I decided to try Adguard For Windows again to see if the issue was still there, unfortunately it is.\r\n> \r\n> So I am finally reported it here like I already did through all other Aguard support methods.\r\n> \r\n> Adguard support did not tell me which filter(s) were the problem, I think I asked, but they did not answer; so you will have to ask them for those details, unfortunately I do not know the ticket number, I just know that my emails with that Adguard support has the subject AdGuard for Windows v7.11 – Bug report from last year.\r\n> \r\n> - Thank you\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
