I selected it to always be allowed access to it. But none of the ads were blocked, so I had to manually x out of pop up ads. But ever since I allowed AdGuard access to the site, I have not been able to x out of certain ads. The touch screen doesn’t work. I literally cannot access the site because the pop up ad takes over the entire screen. I tried to uncheck the site from the allowlist on the app and even deleted it. I reloaded the site but the app still has access to it.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/54j66jf9yh8oswog0c0c80ksw8skw4cot38wij89r4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/lwv9y9andts4kkcoogcc4gg4ckog0gwliagl6gjc74.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.10\r\nLicense type: | free\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201467/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-23T00:44:55Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
