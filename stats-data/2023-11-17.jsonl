The word \"LIVE\" is displayed in the upper left corner of the thumbnail of such videos.\r\n> \r\n> Perhaps due to limitations of the TVer application caused by broadcasting rights and other rights-related issues, we were unable to take a screenshot of the scene where the communication error occurred. When I tried to take one, all I could get was a black screen.\r\n> \r\n> I remember that the communication error occurred even when the content blocking filter/DNS filtering/stealth mode was deactivated, so the communication error may have occurred because AdGuard for Android was running in VPN mode. It could also be a problem specific to the TVer app.\r\n> \r\n> Also, the communication error does not seem to occur all the time. I selected a completely different live stream and it took a while to load, but played without issue. I am not technically knowledgeable so this may be an inaccurate statement.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/rggo1fguccg0gc804cgcwgkwwocok4k3wp040je01m.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hskf5myb9vcwooso88o4wscow0gss0c8ogdm9mehqg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/cbqszev6ow84okcss0c4o4gso88004l7j565zbjk04.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mxxkaq207nk4s8cs8gco4o0kg4kos88j9i1n5a5snc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.2.118\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | TVer(ティーバー) 民放公式テレビ配信サービス\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.google/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese\r\nCustom filters: | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yuki2718/adblock2/main/japanese/jpf-plus.txt\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1815930465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-17T08:27:49Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
