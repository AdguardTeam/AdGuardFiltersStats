день.\r\n\r\nПроблема, на самом деле, не с блокировщиком реклама AdGuard, а с AdGuard VPN. Я обратился его техподдержку и спустя нескоьлко дней переписки один из менеджеров попросил меня сделать dump соединения с Instagram.com с помощью AdGuard Assistant, чтобы также автоматически создался прецедент на GitHub. Что я и сделал.\r\n\r\nВ основном я переписывался с поддержкой по электронной почте. Если вкратце, то все указанные мною web-сайты работают с AdGuard VPN без нареканий, но недели три назад пропал доступ к Instagram.com. (AdGuard VPN работает в режиме туннелирования доступа к выбранному списку web-сайтов и для заданных desktop-приложений.) Какое-то время меня это не напрягало, но раз я решил обратиться в поддержку, чтобы разобраться с этим. Примерно со времени моего обращения доступ к Instagram.com начал появляться примерно на полчаса через другие полчаса, в которые сайт доступен уже не был. (Отследить чёткие интервалы доступности у меня не было возможности.)\r\n\r\nНо с момента, когда закрыли ticket, созданный при обращении по email (дня три назад), Instagram.com больше не был доступен :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2532215589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-12-10T16:27:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
