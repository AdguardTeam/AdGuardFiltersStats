\r\n> I hope you are doing well.\r\n> \r\n> I’ve encountered an issue when using AdGuard with the website statsfa.com\r\n> . The site does not display correctly due to AdGuard’s security settings. At first, I thought it might be a conflict with the Brave browser, but after further testing, I realized the issue occurs in all browsers.\r\n> \r\n> It seems that AdGuard interferes with this website (which is a WordPress statistics plugin), causing its CSS not to load at all and breaking the layout completely.\r\n> \r\n> I kindly ask you to look into this problem and provide a fix in future updates so the site can function properly.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you for your support and great work.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/a47b033gso8ows8k8s8o4owgo444gocfuisus6vh3s.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/bi5oqe2as4ook0okgocs4oockos04kciabk8ls595w.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.139 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 11`\r\nBrowser: | Brave\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880)<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Persian Blocker\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `https://statsfa.com/`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/212148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/212148/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3233715376","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/212148#issuecomment-3233715376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/212148","id":3233715376,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87AvpSw","user":{"login":"Parsa307","id":79400634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDAwNjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79400634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parsa307","html_url":"https://github.com/Parsa307","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parsa307/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parsa307/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parsa307/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parsa307/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parsa307/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parsa307/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parsa307/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parsa307/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parsa307/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-28T14:24:17Z","updated_at":"2025-08-28T14:24:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I fixed in my forked version:\nhttps://github.com/Parsa307/PersianBlocker\n\nMasterKia isn't active that much.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3233715376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-08-28T14:24:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

description\n\n### Problem description\n\nKlaviyo Javascript is being blocked due to the addition of this rule\n\n```\n||static.klaviyo.com/onsite/js/telemetry\n||static.klaviyo.com/onsite/js/event_adapter\n||a.klaviyo.com\n```\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe correct blocked script should be\n\n```\n||static-tracking.klaviyo.com/onsite/*\n```\nwhich blocks any analytics scripts/API requests/etc that Klaviyo uses for shopper identification.\n\nWe should _not_ be blocking requests to `a.klaviyo.com`. That rule should be removed.\n\n### Additional information\n\nA similar issue was submitted: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210120#issuecomment-3128250521\n\nBut the fix implemented was not the proposed solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3233930593","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210537#issuecomment-3233930593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210537","id":3233930593,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87Awd1h","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-28T15:17:01Z","updated_at":"2025-08-28T15:17:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@owen-carpenter-klaviyo Ok, got it.

Comment\r\n> User rules/allow list doesn’t seem to work\r\n> Steps to replicate:\r\n> 1: enter any website\r\n> 2: disable AdGuard and reload the page if it doesn’t do so automatically\r\n> 3: observe how the website looks no different\r\n> \r\n> The only way to actually disable AdGuard, whether it’s supposed to be disabled on that website or not, is to select “Turn Off Content Blockers” in the other menu.\r\n> The same issue is present on an iPhone running iOS of the same version.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @Luigi2262\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1
