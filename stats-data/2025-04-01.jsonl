Comment\r\n> При включенной фильтрации только на этом сайте если включить сортировку по новизне, в любом из разделов при пролистывании страницы вниз страница сама начинает прокручиваться вверх и вниз, такое происходит только если включена сортировка по новизне. Эта проблема уже около полугода (как то была ранее и я создавал обращение в тех. поддержку и её исправляли, но она вернулась через несколько лет). Если отключить фильтрацию на 30 сек. и прокрутить страничку до первой подгрузки новых объявлений то страничка прокручивается нормально и по истечении 30 сек подгрузка рекламных миниатюр вместо иконок объявлений прекращается (то есть всё работает как положено, до обновления странички например по F5 или перехода в другую категорию объявлений и выборе сортировки по новизне). Очень надеюсь что в следующем релизе это исправят так как ждать устал и написал обращение.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
