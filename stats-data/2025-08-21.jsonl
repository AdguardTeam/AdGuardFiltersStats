I'm using Adguard Home with Adguard QUIC (other protocols untested) DNS upstream configured. It returns `127.0.0.1` as an answer for `www.themoviedb.org`. As I understand, this is commonly used for blocking. However, I couldn't find it in your filterlists, besides the [allow rule](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/bc4da839f3cbccbb786c94fe0dfa6b920fef3a2d/BaseFilter/sections/allowlist_stealth.txt#L364) for unbreaking.\n\n2.

I'm using Adguard Home with Adguard QUIC (other protocols untested) DNS upstream configured. It returns `127.0.0.1` as an answer for `www.themoviedb.org`. As I understand, this is commonly used for blocking. However, I couldn't find it in your filterlists, besides the [allow rule](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/bc4da839f3cbccbb786c94fe0dfa6b920fef3a2d/BaseFilter/sections/allowlist_stealth.txt#L364) for unbreaking.\n\n2.

I'm using Adguard Home with Adguard QUIC (other protocols untested) DNS upstream configured. It returns `127.0.0.1` as an answer for `www.themoviedb.org`. As I understand, this is commonly used for blocking. However, I couldn't find it in your filterlists, besides the [allow rule](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/bc4da839f3cbccbb786c94fe0dfa6b920fef3a2d/BaseFilter/sections/allowlist_stealth.txt#L364) for unbreaking.\n\n2.

That's a crucial detail. Here's the updated GitHub issue:\r\n> Title\r\n> Endless login loop caused by browser extension conflict\r\n> Description\r\n> Bug Report\r\n> I'm experiencing an endless login loop on the Poppy AI web application that appears to be caused by a browser extension conflict. After successfully logging in and viewing my projects, clicking on any project redirects me back to the login page. The issue resolves completely when all browser extensions are disabled.\r\n> Steps to Reproduce\r\n> \r\n> Navigate to https://app.getpoppy.ai/login with extensions enabled\r\n> Click \"Continue with Google\" or enter email credentials\r\n> Successfully login and reach the boards page (https://app.getpoppy.ai/boards)\r\n> Click on any project/board from the list\r\n> Get redirected back to https://app.getpoppy.ai/login\r\n> \r\n> Workaround Found\r\n> The issue is completely resolved when I disable all browser extensions in Edge settings. This indicates an extension compatibility issue rather than a core application bug.\r\n> Expected Behavior\r\n> After clicking on a project, I should be taken to that project's workspace/dashboard regardless of enabled extensions.\r\n> Actual Behavior\r\n> Clicking on any project immediately redirects me back to the login page when extensions are enabled, but works perfectly when extensions are disabled.\r\n> Environment\r\n> \r\n> Browser: Microsoft Edge (Version [your version])\r\n> OS: Windows [your version]\r\n> URL: https://app.getpoppy.ai/\r\n> Extensions: Microsoft Edge Unminification Extension v135.0.3176.0 - ID: cgjgjfacjflmgphhhepmbhhbgjieaecn, Notebook LM v1.0.0.3 - ID: dgenbagabmmjpfjlbcnnlmpopipdapjo, Hunter - Email Finder Extension v3.1.3 - ID: dmgcgojogkfomifjfeeafajhmgilkofk, Tokmate v1.0.11 - ID: eblnpfeekmoledbhianpljdjbemkblim, Titans Quick View - Amazon Niche Finder v8.54 - ID: eefljgmhgaidffapnppcmmafobefjece, ChatGPT search v1.11 - ID: ejcfepkfckglbgocfkanmcdngdijcgld, FrankerFaceZ v4.77.11.2 - ID: fadndhdgpmmaapbmfcknlfgcflmmmieb, Meta Pixel Helper v3.0.7 - ID: fdgfkebogiimcoedlicjlajpkdmockpc, Google Docs Offline v1.94.1 - ID: ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi, WebSync full site importer for NotebookLM v1.1.3.25608 - ID: hjoonjdnhagnpfgifhjolheimamcafok, addy.io - Anonymous Email Forwarding v2.3.7 - ID: iadbdpnoknmbdeolbapdackdcogdmjpe, Mega Messenger v3.0.4 - ID: iddifpoaoiehbfgifechnhameaahpnbi, NotebookLM - Youtube Link (Source) Automator v0.2 - ID: idkdddfdfhlgjleoieidjhmgmopacdli, Chrome Remote Desktop v2.1 - ID: inomeogfingihgjfjlpeplalcfajhgai, Bitwarden Password Manager v2025.7.0 - ID: jbkfoedolllekgbhcbcoahefnbanhhlh, Edge relevant text changes v1.2.1 - ID: jmjflgjpcpepeafmmgdpfkogkghcpiha, Microsoft Power Automate v2.55.0.31 - ID: kagpabjoboikccfdghpdlaaopmgpgfdc, Microsoft Edge DevTools Enhancements v113.0.1765.0 - ID: kfbdpdaobnofkbopebjglnaadopfikhh, AutoBuzz AI v1.0.3 - ID: lipommpcimhmhdnfbbpiggajcooldoig, GoBeaver AI v3.0 - ID: mchgbjjkiggignhnjedcgfmkjfbafafa, EverBee - Find Best Selling Products on Etsy v9.1.11.4 - ID: oeicpkgdngoghobnbjngekclpcmpgpij, AdGuard AdBlocker v5.1.102 - ID: pdffkfellgipmhklpdmokmckkkfcopbh, Detailed SEO Extension v2.2.4 - ID: pfjdepjjfjjahkjfpkcgfmfhmnakjfba\r\n> \r\n> Likely Culprits\r\n> Based on the extension list, potential candidates that might interfere with authentication flows:\r\n> \r\n> AdGuard AdBlocker (may block auth-related requests)\r\n> Meta Pixel Helper (might interfere with tracking/analytics)\r\n> Hunter - Email Finder Extension (could interfere with email-based auth)\r\n> Various content modification extensions\r\n> \r\n> Technical Notes\r\n> This suggests an extension is either:\r\n> \r\n> Blocking authentication cookies or session tokens\r\n> Interfering with redirect flows\r\n> Modifying authentication-related JavaScript/requests\r\n> Conflicting with the application's session management\r\n> \r\n> Request\r\n> Could you provide guidance on which types of extensions commonly conflict with your authentication system?

I'm using Adguard Home with Adguard QUIC (other protocols untested) DNS upstream configured. It returns `127.0.0.1` as an answer for `www.themoviedb.org`. As I understand, this is commonly used for blocking. However, I couldn't find it in your filterlists, besides the [allow rule](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/bc4da839f3cbccbb786c94fe0dfa6b920fef3a2d/BaseFilter/sections/allowlist_stealth.txt#L364) for unbreaking.\n\n2.

I'm using Adguard Home with Adguard QUIC (other protocols untested) DNS upstream configured. It returns `127.0.0.1` as an answer for `www.themoviedb.org`. As I understand, this is commonly used for blocking. However, I couldn't find it in your filterlists, besides the [allow rule](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/bc4da839f3cbccbb786c94fe0dfa6b920fef3a2d/BaseFilter/sections/allowlist_stealth.txt#L364) for unbreaking.\n\n2.

I'm using Adguard Home with Adguard QUIC (other protocols untested) DNS upstream configured. It returns `127.0.0.1` as an answer for `www.themoviedb.org`. As I understand, this is commonly used for blocking. However, I couldn't find it in your filterlists, besides the [allow rule](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/bc4da839f3cbccbb786c94fe0dfa6b920fef3a2d/BaseFilter/sections/allowlist_stealth.txt#L364) for unbreaking.\n\n2.
