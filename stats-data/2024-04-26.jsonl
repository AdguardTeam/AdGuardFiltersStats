But now a week later, it's back to these scam chat popups and fullscreen hidden elements with malicious links... And it also hijacks the <title> as seen in the screenshot.\r\n> \r\n> These malicious links are also just passing by AdGuard, including all the redirects?

Previous issue here: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175003\r\n> \r\n> After the change by Alex-302 the ads were gone, but the site still injected some <a> element that covered the whole screen. But now a week later, it's back to these scam chat popups and fullscreen hidden elements with malicious links... And it also hijacks the <title> as seen in the screenshot.\r\n> \r\n> These malicious links are also just passing by AdGuard, including all the redirects? And yes I've checked several times and AdGuard is enabled with all these filters.
