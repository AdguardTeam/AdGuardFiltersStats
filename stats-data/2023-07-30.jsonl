I'm currently using uBlock Origin and this website is broken and unusable with the \"AdGuard - Cookie Notices\" list enabled. I have attached a screenshot below. The website appears to have a blurred overlay over it that you can't click or do anything on. I have done testing and confirmed the issue resolves with this list disabled. Just wanted to report this issue to your attention so hopefully it can be fixed, thank you.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/80vfyrmku4w80kco00wcwws4kk4kg0go2aneeua9f4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qlqzy1vh0f4kosww84c88k4k48w8s8k5zpu5x4x3rc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | uBlock Origin\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nFilters: | <b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices\r\nOther extensions used: | N/A, Only using uBlock Origin","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/157775/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-30T21:21:24Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
