A lot of websites either not opening or needs to refresh the page multiple times to get it works. Keep in mind that I’ve not changed anything recently either in my WIN11 OS, BitDefender AntiVirus or AdGuard itself, and everything was totally working fine previously.\r\n> For example, https://ipass.cma.org.sa/ if AG is enabled the website won’t open at all.
