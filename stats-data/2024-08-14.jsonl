A lot of websites either not opening or needs to refresh the page multiple times to get it works. Keep in mind that I’ve not changed anything recently either in my WIN11 OS, BitDefender AntiVirus or AdGuard itself, and everything was totally working fine previously.\r\n> For example, https://ipass.cma.org.sa/ if AG is enabled the website won’t open at all. But If I totally disable AG the website will open normally.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/diubprcoaqgcs0cc4k4okg0ck8kkcoog8a9ugayg4g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/5ceg6a5e4ao0k88ssw48sss4wsog004p00v71dbpes.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.18.1 (4778)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.22631.0\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block trackers, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/windows/filters/15.txt`, `User rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>Estonian List, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>IndianList</details>\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | BitDefender AntiVirus and AdGuard, No other AdBlocker Ext\r\n\r\n### Import issue configuration (AdGuard for Windows)\r\n[Import](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=adguard%3Aimport_user_configuration%3Fbrowsing_security.enabled%3Dtrue%26browsing_security.statistics_enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.custom_bootstrap%3D%26dns.custom_fallback%3D%26dns.enabled%3Dtrue%26dns.fallback_mode%3DSystem%26dns.filters%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ffilters.adtidy.org%252Fwindows%252Ffilters%252F15.txt%252CUser%2Brules%26dns.filters_enabled%3Dtrue%26dns.servers%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdns.adguard-dns.com%252Fdns-query%26dns.timeout%3D0%26filters%3D103.105.109.112.218.235.243.14.16.1.224.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.253%26license_type%3Dpaid%26parental_control.block_exe%3Dfalse%26parental_control.enabled%3Dtrue%26parental_control.safe_search%3Dfalse%26product_type%3DWin%26product_version%3D7.18.1%2B%25284778%2529%26referrer%3D%26stealth.DNT%3Dtrue%26stealth.block_third_party_auth%3Dfalse%26stealth.block_trackers%3Dtrue%26stealth.disable_third_party_cache%3Dfalse%26stealth.disable_wap_push_message_routing_service%3Dfalse%26stealth.disable_windows_defender%3Dfalse%26stealth.disable_windows_telemetry%3Dtrue%26stealth.dpi%3Dfalse%26stealth.enabled%3Dtrue%26stealth.flash%3Dfalse%26stealth.hide_search_queries%3Dtrue%26stealth.java%3Dfalse%26stealth.location%3Dfalse%26stealth.push%3Dfalse%26stealth.strip_url%3Dfalse%26stealth.third_party_cookies%3D180%26stealth.turn_off_advertising_id%3Dtrue%26stealth.webrtc%3Dfalse%26stealth.x_client%3Dtrue%26system_version%3DMicrosoft%2BWindows%2BNT%2B10.0.22631.0%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fipass.cma.org.sa%252F%26user_agent%3DMozilla%252F5.0%2B%2528Windows%2BNT%2B10.0%253B%2BWin64%253B%2Bx64%2529%2BAppleWebKit%252F537.36%2B%2528KHTML%252C%2Blike%2BGecko%2529%2BChrome%252F127.0.0.0%2BSafari%252F537.36%26userscripts%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fadguard-extra%252F1.0%252Fadguard-extra.user.js%252Chttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fpopup-blocker%252F2.5%252Fpopupblocker.user.js%26utm_campaign%3Dreport%26utm_medium%3Dassistant%26utm_source%3Dwin%26win.wfp%3Dtrue)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-14T07:03:17Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
