Comment\r\n> Previously have had no issues with adguard and it worked great and blocked all ads on peacock. Today it randomly started allowing peacock ads to go thorugh and would like a solution to this please. I've tried restarted my computer, updating everything, uninstall and reinstall the app, as well as added the adguard extra extension and it is not working\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jz4snbzrklc000s4s48s8wk4o04kgwc5aw92askhqw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/rnbb0eqbydwog4kg044ocggwg484owc6ubc3w20yn8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.116 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 11`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `none`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3050732142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-09T01:19:38Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
