Comment\r\n> Previously have had no issues with adguard and it worked great and blocked all ads on peacock. Today it randomly started allowing peacock ads to go thorugh and would like a solution to this please. I've tried restarted my computer, updating everything, uninstall and reinstall the app, as well as added the adguard extra extension and it is not working\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jz4snbzrklc000s4s48s8wk4o04kgwc5aw92askhqw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/rnbb0eqbydwog4kg044ocggwg484owc6ubc3w20yn8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.116 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 11`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `none`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3050732142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-09T01:19:38Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

The list strips it out on specific domains only (see for example specific.txt at [L22](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/TrackParamFilter/sections/specific.txt#L22), [L47](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/TrackParamFilter/sections/specific.txt#L47), etc.)\n\nIs this intended? Have you noticed that stripping out `ref` by default breaks too many websites?

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://www.google.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> I am writing to the Adguard team regarding the fact that their Adguard Annoyances Filter blocks Google’s AI Overview. In my opinion, this rule should not be included in the Adguard Annoyances Filter because it is neither a disturbance nor a privacy risk for the user (or at least not more than a normal Google search). Google’s AI Overview feature is very useful and, in fact, not disruptive; therefore, users should be given the option to choose whether to filter it or not. \r\n> \r\n> It shouldn’t be, due to the extremists who fear AI \"spying on everyone,\" that everyone is forced to be unable to use it. I see two options:  \r\n> \r\n> + Create a dedicated filter with rules to remove Google’s AI Overview (in a separate filter, not in Adguard Annoyances Filter)\r\n> \r\n> + Insert the rule to unblock it in UsefulAds Filter – Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotions\r\n> \r\n> I would be very happy if you considered this feedback, which I believe could be very useful for users who don’t want to be bombarded with ads but at the same time don’t want to give up very useful search engine features.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/7o1ttrkrj0socgk848sc8s44o84gk4gkl5tu8o9itw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/b3cm01nr4nk8gkwosk8o888c0wwk00si6iwzvdshrk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Adguard Annoyances Filter v5.1.102\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Xfiles","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3052226932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-09T11:10:16Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

contain Chinese characters.\r\n> \r\n> For example, try searching for **\"伺服器 ithome\"** on `www.google.com`.  \r\n> When opening the ithome website from the search results, the address cannot be entered properly.\r\n> \r\n> **Example URL:**\r\n> - [https://www.google.com/search?q=伺服器+ithome&newwindow=1](https://www.google.com/search?q=伺服器+ithome&newwindow=1)\r\n> -

Comment\r\n> AdGuard is unable to correctly handle Percent-Encoding (e.g., `%=` = `%25`, `&` = `%26`) under certain circumstances.  \r\n> This issue arises when processing specific URLs or URLs that contain Chinese characters.\r\n> \r\n> For example, try searching for **\"伺服器 ithome\"** on `www.google.com`.  \r\n> When opening the ithome website from the search results, the address cannot be entered properly.\r\n> \r\n> **Example URL:**\r\n> - [https://www.google.com/search?q=伺服器+ithome&newwindow=1](https://www.google.com/search?q=伺服器+ithome&newwindow=1)\r\n> - [https://www.google.com/search?q=%E4%BC%BA%E6%9C%8D%E5%99%A8+ithome&newwindow=1](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E4%BC%BA%E6%9C%8D%E5%99%A8+ithome&newwindow=1)\r\n> \r\n> By disabling protection for `www.google.com` via the **AdGuard browser extension** on **MS Edge**, the issue can be quickly resolved.  \r\n> However, since I am using **AdGuard for Windows**, the problem may be related to features such as traffic filtering or HTTPS filtering.\r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Many regular users probably like this feature. They might not even know (including myself before seeing this issue) that AdGuard is blocking it.\nI'm aware that this feature is not 100% accurate all the time and some users don't like this. But still, it is something that comes with Google and it's up to Google to decide whether they'll give users the option to disable it or not. \nCorrect me if I'm wrong but I think even Bing and Brave search has feature similar to this. So it might become the norm for other search engines and should not be counted as an annoyance.

Этот домен использует приложение TrackChecker для трекинга посылок (package tracking), не для аналитики. После блокировки этого домена у пользователей перестали отслеживаться трек-номера на некоторых почтовых службах (Почта России, DHL и т.п.), которые отслеживаются через этот сервер.\r\n\r\n2. Screenshots\r\n\r\nСкриншотов нет - приложение не получает ответа от сервера и соответственно не получает обновления событий у трек-номера.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I

I understand that AI Overview is only blocked in the optional AdGuard Other Annoyances filter, which is intended to disable other nuisance elements. \r\n> \r\n> However, I wanted to ask if it might be possible to at least unblock AI Overview in the UsefulAds Filter – Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotions – since that is precisely the purpose of that filter. Separating the rule from the AdGuard Other Annoyances filter would help users who want to retain this useful search feature without unnecessary restrictions.\r\n> \r\n> I apologize for reopening this thread, but I wanted to clarify my request and see if there might be a way to address it. This issue has also been raised by others in this GitHub discussion: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/208774\r\n> \r\n> Thank you very much for your time and
