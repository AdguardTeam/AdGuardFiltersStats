tracking analytics. I found a comprehensive explanation here: https://pizza-and-ramen.tumblr.com/post/696959487758745600/tumblr-is-tracking-shared-links\r\n> \r\n> The problem is that with AdGuard enabled, the URL shortening seems to break.

screen, and these outputs seems to be some error messages. After turning off AdGuard, as the second screenshot shown, these texts disappear. The whole text, which is captured when the website is not loaded completely, is in the fifth screenshot.\r\nI guess these texts may be caused by div#contentContainer.style-scope.tp-yt-app-drawer, the sidebar of YouTube, or something related to that. As the third and the fourth screenshot shown, after deleting that element, these texts disappear.\r\nThese texts do not only appear in the home page, but everywhere with the sidebar. And they also move with the sidebar, as the sixth and seventh screenshot shown.\r\nI hope these massages will help you to figure out what happened to this bug. Have a nice day!\r\n\r\nThat's caused by `Web Annoyances Ultralist` filter list, please add this rule:\r\n```adblock\r\nyoutube.com#@$##contentContainer.tp-yt-app-drawer[swipe-open].tp-yt-app-drawer::after, tp-yt-app-drawer { position: absolute !important; }\r\n```\r\nto user rules or disable this filter list.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1425524364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-10T09:43:18Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

@vic233333\r\n> As the first screenshot shown, there is some text outputs on the screen, and these outputs seems to be some error messages. After turning off AdGuard, as the second screenshot shown, these texts disappear. The whole text, which is captured when the website is not loaded completely, is in the fifth screenshot.\r\n> I guess these texts may be caused by div#contentContainer.style-scope.tp-yt-app-drawer, the sidebar of YouTube, or something related to that. As the third and the fourth screenshot shown, after deleting that element, these texts disappear.\r\n> These texts do not only appear in the home page, but everywhere with the sidebar. And they also move with the sidebar, as the sixth and seventh screenshot shown.\r\n> I hope these massages will help you to figure out what happened to this bug.  Have a nice day!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/qfgIJ1K.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/DcbxTS3.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/ZZfepOC.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Y2KsTu6.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://reports-img.adguard.com/beQIWTP.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 6</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 6](https://reports-img.adguard.com/brM2yyB.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 7</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 7](https://reports-img.adguard.com/2TwwN2W.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1425448426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-10T09:01:21Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @G-Terov\r\n> Здравствуйте! \r\n> Уже довольно давно при поиске картинок при помощи https://yandex.ru/images/search сталкиваюсь с неблокируемыми рекламными баннерами. Иногда они сразу же в поиске появляются, а иногда приходится крутить боковую панель с миниатюрами картинок, отметил эту область на скриншоте. В моем примере я ввел сперва \"пластиковые окна\", а после \"машины бмв\", после обновления фильтров и Adguard, но ничего не изменилось, реклама все равно видна. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/s0g7JKL.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/jNBcWJ1.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/xJge1CA.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.12\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (yandex.ru), <br>Hide your User-Agent ()\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://unfiltered.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `User+rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>Bulgarian list, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese</details>\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Антивирус Norton Security, расширения браузера Clear URL's и Ghostery ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1425607444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-10T10:42:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

description\n\nIf users have the AdGuard enabled in their adblocking extensions, then they cannot load our feature flags and a/b tests. The effect is different across our product, such as missing new functionality, new styles, or new versions of existing capabilities.

We are an education benefit provider, helping connect our users to debt-free education.
