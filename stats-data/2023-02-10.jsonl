tracking analytics. I found a comprehensive explanation here: https://pizza-and-ramen.tumblr.com/post/696959487758745600/tumblr-is-tracking-shared-links\r\n> \r\n> The problem is that with AdGuard enabled, the URL shortening seems to break. And so, in the tumblr mobile app, clicking Share > Copy URL on that same post gives me this monstrosity:\r\n> \r\n> https://at.tumblr.com/a/key_live_loIM22jCfY1c0N7G2HnBDcmjDCpTeypJ?%24randomized_bundle_token=1102629599139559913&alias=pizza-and-ramen/tumblr-is-tracking-shared-links/02dv7jdqyrg2&type=0&duration=0&source=ios&data=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%3D%3D\r\n> \r\n> Now, putting this in a web browser DOES technically work.
