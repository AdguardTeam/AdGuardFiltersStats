Comment\r\n> ipadだとなぜか再現できませんでしたが、iphoneでは2端末で容易に再現できました。再現手順はiphoneで adguard base filter とadguard クッキー通知フィルター、高度な保護機能を使用して(safariの機能拡張を管理→一番上のAdguardボタンをオンにしている時)当該サイトを利用するという手順です(商品を検索したり、商品ページを読み込む等)。症状は、繰り返し問題が起きたとして再読み込みが起きたり、端末が通常より発熱したり、ページ表示の遅延、検索欄が反応しないなどです。高度な保護機能をオフにしている時ページは通常通りに動きます。\r\n\r\n###
