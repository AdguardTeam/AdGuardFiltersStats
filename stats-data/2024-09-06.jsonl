Comment\r\n> ipadだとなぜか再現できませんでしたが、iphoneでは2端末で容易に再現できました。再現手順はiphoneで adguard base filter とadguard クッキー通知フィルター、高度な保護機能を使用して(safariの機能拡張を管理→一番上のAdguardボタンをオンにしている時)当該サイトを利用するという手順です(商品を検索したり、商品ページを読み込む等)。症状は、繰り返し問題が起きたとして再読み込みが起きたり、端末が通常より発熱したり、ページ表示の遅延、検索欄が反応しないなどです。高度な保護機能をオフにしている時ページは通常通りに動きます。\r\n\r\n###

хотят открываться застревая в редирект- петле (судя по дампу из adguard 59 редиректов + исходный запрос), пока сам хром не даёт отбой по достижении предела редиректов и не выдаёт \"ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS\". Ссылки без трекинга (без мусора после \".html\"). В хроме \"напрямую\" открываются без проблем. В хром-интеграции в ТГ идёт редирект-петля. Модуль антитрекинга пробовал отключать, но это не помогает. \r\n\r\nПохоже, дело действительно в AdGuard, но не в антитрекинге. По крайней мере не в самой функции. В режиме интеграции браузера adguard'ом срезаются куки и вероятно из-за наличия реферера телеграма (а мб и ещё почему) антиспам система озона и али считает, что ссылку открывает бот и постоянно редиректит на страницу для выдачи кук а т.к. куки срезаются всё уходит в петлю. Если отключить для озона антитрекинг через правило\r\n\r\n>@@||ozon.ru^$stealth\r\n\r\nто во \"встроенном браузере\" телеграма озон открывается без заморочек. Походу дело всё-таки в антитрекинге, но не в том, что включается отдельной функцией, а в том, что работает через фильтры. Или это один и тот же механизм ? Но почему тогда отключение функции не даёт эффекта ? Какое будет более корректное правило, что позволит минимизировать утечки ? Пробовал перебирать стелс-опции вплоть до использования\r\n\r\n>@@||ozon.ru^$stealth=searchqueries|donottrack|3p-cookie|1p-cookie|3p-cache|3p-auth|webrtc|push|location|flash|java|referrer|useragent|ip|xclientdata|dpi\r\n\r\nно петлевой редирект остаётся.\r\n\r\n3.

хотят открываться застревая в редирект- петле (судя по дампу из adguard 59 редиректов + исходный запрос), пока сам хром не даёт отбой по достижении предела редиректов и не выдаёт \"ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS\". Ссылки без трекинга (без мусора после \".html\"). В хроме \"напрямую\" открываются без проблем. В хром-интеграции в ТГ идёт редирект-петля. Модуль антитрекинга пробовал отключать, но это не помогает. \r\n\r\nПохоже, дело действительно в AdGuard, но не в антитрекинге. По крайней мере не в самой функции. В режиме интеграции браузера adguard'ом срезаются куки и вероятно из-за наличия реферера телеграма (а мб и ещё почему) антиспам система озона и али считает, что ссылку открывает бот и постоянно редиректит на страницу для выдачи кук а т.к. куки срезаются всё уходит в петлю. Если отключить для озона антитрекинг через правило\r\n\r\n>@@||ozon.ru^$stealth\r\n\r\nто во \"встроенном браузере\" телеграма озон открывается без заморочек. Походу дело всё-таки в антитрекинге, но не в том, что включается отдельной функцией, а в том, что работает через фильтры. Или это один и тот же механизм ? Но почему тогда отключение функции не даёт эффекта ? Какое будет более корректное правило, что позволит минимизировать утечки ? Пробовал перебирать стелс-опции вплоть до использования\r\n\r\n>@@||ozon.ru^$stealth=searchqueries|donottrack|3p-cookie|1p-cookie|3p-cache|3p-auth|webrtc|push|location|flash|java|referrer|useragent|ip|xclientdata|dpi\r\n\r\nно петлевой редирект остаётся.\r\n\r\n3.
