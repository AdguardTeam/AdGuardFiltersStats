ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript.

It can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> Saving memory feature of your web browser or sleep feature of your operating system can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n> In this case, please re-enable AdGuard's filtering by toggling the protection toggle.\n> Following the instructions can be needed.\n\n### The instructions\n1. Force to update the filters by clicking the reload button in AdGuard Browser Extension/AdGuard mobile or update tray menu in your system tray. [^2]\n2. Reload the YouTube webpage without cache by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> [^3].\n3. Clear cache, cookies and site data of your web browser.\n4.

The blocked XHR request is **retried endlessly**, which causes **high memory usage** until the tab crashes or becomes unresponsive.\r\n> - The issue is consistently reproducible on \"Moment\"-type pages when the rule is active.\r\n> \r\n> ###  Testing Notes\r\n> \r\n> - **New Firefox profile (default settings):** Problem disappears temporarily, then returns after we2_consent cookie being added.\r\n> - **New Firefox profile (restored backup settings):** Does **not trigger** the issue. then returns after we2_consent cookie being added.\r\n> - **Private Browsing Mode (logged in/out):** Does **not trigger** the issue. then returns after we2_consent cookie being added.\r\n> - **Clean Slate (Delete cookies/storage):** Does **not trigger** the issue. then returns after we2_consent cookie being added.\r\n> \r\n> ###  Cookies Triggering the issue:\r\n> -
