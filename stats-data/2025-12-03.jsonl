動画再生ボタン押下後アンケートが現れます。アンケートに回答せずともm3u8ファイルを取得可能なのは以前と変わりません。\r\n> \r\n> 私は日常的にTverを利用することはないので気づきませんでしたが、Tver側がいたちごっこを仕掛けてきている可能性もありそうですね。\r\n> \r\n> The questionnaire appears after a click on the play

extract m3u8 data of the movie, so I guess there is some way to bypass the wall without assigning a random value to each question.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1
