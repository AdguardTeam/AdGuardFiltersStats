動画再生ボタン押下後アンケートが現れます。アンケートに回答せずともm3u8ファイルを取得可能なのは以前と変わりません。\r\n> \r\n> 私は日常的にTverを利用することはないので気づきませんでしたが、Tver側がいたちごっこを仕掛けてきている可能性もありそうですね。\r\n> \r\n> The questionnaire appears after a click on the play

extract m3u8 data of the movie, so I guess there is some way to bypass the wall without assigning a random value to each question.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://hackle.io/ko/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhackle.io%2Fko%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> I am writing to report a critical false positive regarding the recent addition of the hackle.io domain to your filter lists.\r\n> \r\n> We have identified that the entire hackle.io domain was globally blocked in the following commit: Reference: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/commit/0de304ca17cf83e088a8ac4cb6829702766942fd\r\n> \r\n> While we understand and respect the goal of blocking tracking scripts, applying a wildcard block to hackle.io is causing severe disruptions for the following reasons:\r\n> \r\n> Disruption of Critical Functionality (Feature Flags): Hackle provides infrastructure for Feature Flags and Remote Configuration, which are essential for controlling application logic and feature rollouts. Blocking the API endpoints prevents applications from retrieving necessary configurations, leading to service malfunctions, not just a lack of metrics.\r\n> \r\n> Inaccessibility of Product Page: The current rule blocks the main landing page as well. This prevents legitimate users and developers from accessing the product documentation and service information.\r\n> \r\n> This global block is too aggressive and negatively impacts the user experience of services relying on Hackle for non-tracking purposes.\r\n> \r\n> We kindly request that you review this rule and remove the global block on hackle.io or narrow the scope to target only specific tracking endpoints, ensuring that core functionalities remain operational.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you for your time and prompt assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @sungwoo-hackle\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/kix8j90whmo4wgos0c8kwg8cowswc88d5l8weng8xw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/i8699j5xcu0wgsws0o40cgs0880kkcok7c98qbfduo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.14(1040)\r\nSystem version: | `ios 26.1`\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `system dns`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/219328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/219328/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-12-03T07:47:49Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
