problem with ad blocking on the Disney+ Android Mobile application.  I have the version of Disney+ with ads and when I get to a point where there are ads, Adguard blocks the ads but I lose a few seconds of the video, it skips a song and even if I go back impossible to see the song that was skipped. I haven't had this problem since Dinsey+ on browser.

problem with ad blocking on the Disney+ Android Mobile application.  I have the version of Disney+ with ads and when I get to a point where there are ads, Adguard blocks the ads but I lose a few seconds of the video, it skips a song and even if I go back impossible to see the song that was skipped. I haven't had this problem since Dinsey+ on browser. I think the problem comes from blocking the url \"eu-west-1.ads.digital.disneyadvertising.com\". \n\n### Privacy\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1995228949","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174633#issuecomment-1995228949","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174633","id":1995228949,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM8527McV","user":{"login":"Barzaquaa","id":60731844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzMxODQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60731844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa","html_url":"https://github.com/Barzaquaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barzaquaa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-13T18:09:08Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T18:09:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Got it.
