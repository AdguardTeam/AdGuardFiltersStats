удалить Savefrom.net поскольку давно им не пользовался после удаления почему-то остались элементы кнопки хотя расширение давно удалено из браузера, на скриншотах я указал также название элемента, удаление элемента через f12 также ничего не дало, в итоге элемент вроде как удален и он не появляется но при включенном adguard все равно появляется, когда делаю блокировку \"заблокировать рекламу на этом сайте\" элемент(savefrom.net) конечно же убирается, но все равно мешает работу другим расширение такими как \"Returnyoutubedislike\"\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot
