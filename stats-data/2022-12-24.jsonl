удалить Savefrom.net поскольку давно им не пользовался после удаления почему-то остались элементы кнопки хотя расширение давно удалено из браузера, на скриншотах я указал также название элемента, удаление элемента через f12 также ничего не дало, в итоге элемент вроде как удален и он не появляется но при включенном adguard все равно появляется, когда делаю блокировку \"заблокировать рекламу на этом сайте\" элемент(savefrom.net) конечно же убирается, но все равно мешает работу другим расширение такими как \"Returnyoutubedislike\"\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot

Is there anyway this can be resolved of separating the line of code of the ads and the kind of code that make up the video so only the line of code that makes up the ads is blocked so that I can still view the video?2. \r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a video url links to certain videos on gaypornhdfree.com that I have no access to as long as adguard keeps blocking them as ads \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://gaypornhdfree.com/giuspel-favio-vador-behind-the-scenes-in-the-park/\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://gaypornhdfree.com/ethan-chase-ridick/\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://gaypornhdfree.com/nikita-repa-spanking-2/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart of me is worried if any of you attempt this could it jeopardize what has already been in state of gaypornhdfree no longer detecting my adblocker???\r\n\r\n3.
