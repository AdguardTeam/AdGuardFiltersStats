Continuing to scroll in mobile will cause forced refresh/tab crash due to OOM\r\n> \r\n> JS Heap without Adguard: 400 MB\r\n> JS Heap with AdGuard: 1.1 GB (and counting)\r\n> \r\n> Checking network requests blocked:\r\n> 804 network requests when using AdGuard w/ Tracking Protection Filter (refresh):\r\n> https://scv-cafe.io.naver.com/jackpotlog/v1/logs -> 232 blocked\r\n> https://nelo2-col.navercorp.com/_store -> 346 blocked\r\n> \r\n> 840 network requests without AdGuard: \r\n> https://scv-cafe.io.naver.com/jackpotlog/v1/logs -> 456 requests (None blocked)\r\n> https://nelo2-col.navercorp.com/_store -> no requests sent\r\n> \r\n> **Note:** Issue is also replicable on Chrome desktop using uBlock and Tracking Protection filter.\r\n> \r\n> Issue can also be replicated without any adblockers by directly blocking the URLs in DevTools inspect.\r\nUsername: `@mpccelon`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/cokc8pn5yvc4so48kos8wskgcwcowwc69pt591mpf0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/kg8hfvcn39scskg0wcgw888wwg448gwi3a9zt6e80g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/c868izdvt3scok8socsko484skksgoo2e7vs1hvqkc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/scmitfswg1wggwg0gwc8skokkk4wcoctra5xezw840.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/1v8kjp3ssly8gsgs40kk8sscssk8wkgloispg9t4yo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/20q6arf7x9r4osokowgoswg88sw4kwgf1a80s9bzz4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Content Blocker v2.7.3\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Samsung Browser\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>List-KR\r\nOther extensions used: | N/A","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185263/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2264977585","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185263#issuecomment-2264977585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185263","id":2264977585,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86HANCx","user":{"login":"mpccelon","id":39243838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjQzODM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39243838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpccelon","html_url":"https://github.com/mpccelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpccelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpccelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpccelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpccelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpccelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpccelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpccelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpccelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpccelon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-02T09:38:12Z","updated_at":"2024-08-02T09:38:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks, it seems to be fixed on both uBlock when I applied to user rule and deactivated Tracking Protection Filter.\r\n\r\nFrom testing, it is also fixed in Samsung Internet AdGuard Content Blocker also by adding user rule and deactivating Tracking Protection Filter.

Alex, \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor Mozilla/Firefox I did some testing and strangely enough if I use this AdGuard extension Recommended (as is with no modifications) it totally blocks video ads -

<https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adguard-adblocker/bgnkhhnnamicmpeenaelnjfhikgbkllg?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar> &utm_source=ext_sidebar , seems like AdGuard extension for Chrome will
