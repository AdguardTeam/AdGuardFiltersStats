Это началось примерно после того, как я обновила приложение AdGuard, и оно обновилось странно: слетели все фильтры и сертификаты, пришлось устанавливать и настраивать все заново.

Comment\r\n> сложилась такая проблема на телефоне: при работе приложения \"Пикабу\" оно вылетает с критической ошибкой с завидной регулярностью. Это началось примерно после того, как я обновила приложение AdGuard, и оно обновилось странно: слетели все фильтры и сертификаты, пришлось устанавливать и настраивать все заново. Ну, а если отключить  AdGuard, то \"Пикабу\" работает нормально, но реклама замучает.\r\n> \r\n> Так же, я обращалась в поддержку Пикабу, но они говорят, что они ничего не блокировали. Цитирую: \r\n> \"Блокировщики действуют самостоятельно, и при изменении каких-то внутренних фильтров они не обсуждают подобные вопросы с нами.\r\n> С нашей стороны никаких изменений не проводилось, при этом фильтры отмеченных расширений/приложений по блокировке могут наполняться некорректно, что и приводит у пользователей к неполадкам в работе нашего сайта/приложения.\r\n> Зачастую с нашей стороны все-таки нет возможности повлиять на ситуацию кроме как попросить не пользоваться блокировщиками для ресурса\"\r\n> \r\n> Логов критической ошибки нет, никаких расширенных сведений ошибки телефон не выдает. Да и скрин сделать не всегда получается. \r\n> \r\n> Пробовала отключать|включать фильтры, но не помогает.\r\n> \r\n> \r\nUsername: `@ViralissaN`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mrzmdibe91cwgwk84wgw80k8k8ockskm039duibgdw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/s6fs2cm7m1w4wwk4g0kw0ss8sswsc40sk00w4mptxw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.6.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Приложение Пикабу \r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186893/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2301914473","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186893#issuecomment-2301914473","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186893","id":2301914473,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86JNG1p","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-21T12:18:52Z","updated_at":"2024-08-21T12:18:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"На этой неделе, возможно даже сегодня, выйдет обновление 4.6.1 Понаблюдайте ещё с новой версией.\r\n\r\n> слетели все фильтры и сертификаты\r\n\r\nесли повторится - отправьте сообщение в нашу поддержку через меню `Поддержка` => `Сообщить об ошибке`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2301914473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-21T12:18:53Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> сложилась такая проблема на телефоне: при работе приложения \"Пикабу\" оно вылетает с критической ошибкой с завидной регулярностью. Это началось примерно после того, как я обновила приложение AdGuard, и оно обновилось странно: слетели все фильтры и сертификаты, пришлось устанавливать и настраивать все заново. Ну, а если отключить  AdGuard, то \"Пикабу\" работает нормально, но реклама замучает.\r\n> \r\n> Так же, я обращалась в поддержку Пикабу, но они говорят, что они ничего не блокировали. Цитирую: \r\n> \"Блокировщики действуют самостоятельно, и при изменении каких-то внутренних фильтров они не обсуждают подобные вопросы с нами.\r\n> С нашей стороны никаких изменений не проводилось, при этом фильтры отмеченных расширений/приложений по блокировке могут наполняться некорректно, что и приводит у пользователей к неполадкам в работе нашего сайта/приложения.\r\n> Зачастую с нашей стороны все-таки нет возможности повлиять на ситуацию кроме как попросить не пользоваться блокировщиками для ресурса\"\r\n> \r\n> Логов критической ошибки нет, никаких расширенных сведений ошибки телефон не выдает.
