, @Alex-302 , since the [1815 issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1815) was fixed (at least for me), everything is not working again.\r\nBut, I hope, I found a (temporary) workaround: when this QUIC issue was active, there was the Google certificate on YouTube, but there were no ads or overlays, so, I think, AdGuard DNS filtered out all ads. Now I can observe the same behaviour in private Firefox windows: Google certificates, no overlays and no ads.\r\nSo, I think, you can incorporate this \"solution\" at least for now: just don't inject the AdGuard certificate to YouTube, filter it only with the AdGuard DNS.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1766474150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-10-17T13:56:37Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
