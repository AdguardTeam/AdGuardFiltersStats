не видно, но периодически при включенном adguard пропадает соединение с сайтом и режется скорость. Я не могу смотреть в высоком разрешении видео. При отключении adguard скорость возвращается как и реклама и можно смотреть в высоком разрешении. Но я затем и включаю adguard чтобы убрать рекламу и в таком случае не могу смотреть и наслаждаться видео и даже с включенным adguard.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/7Dxsy6H.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Y9m9M7N.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 10\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.11+(54)\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Ничего не использую кроме adguard","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/144892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/144892/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-08T09:33:48Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
