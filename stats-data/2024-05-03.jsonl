Go to the site\r\n> 2. Remove one of the ads on the top or bottom (the side one doesn't affect content) using adguard extension\r\n> 3. Refresh the page\r\n> \r\n> On this site, they added some javascript code that checks if ad images are displayed, and if not, they throw an error and don't load content. That means you can use adguard to manually select and remove ads, but then you basically can't use the site anymore.\r\n> \r\n> I found a solution that works locally, you can see it in the screenshot. I'm just using overrides to comment out the part of the code that throws error and stops the function from loading content.

Comment\r\n> How to reproduce the problem:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Go to the site\r\n> 2. Remove one of the ads on the top or bottom (the side one doesn't affect content) using adguard extension\r\n> 3. Refresh the page\r\n> \r\n> On this site, they added some javascript code that checks if ad images are displayed, and if not, they throw an error and don't load content. That means you can use adguard to manually select and remove ads, but then you basically can't use the site anymore.\r\n> \r\n> I found a solution that works locally, you can see it in the screenshot. I'm just using overrides to comment out the part of the code that throws error and stops the function from loading content.

Comment\r\n> How to reproduce the problem:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Go to the site\r\n> 2. Remove one of the ads on the top or bottom (the side one doesn't affect content) using adguard extension\r\n> 3. Refresh the page\r\n> \r\n> On this site, they added some javascript code that checks if ad images are displayed, and if not, they throw an error and don't load content. That means you can use adguard to manually select and remove ads, but then you basically can't use the site anymore.\r\n> \r\n> I found a solution that works locally, you can see it in the screenshot. I'm just using overrides to comment out the part of the code that throws error and stops the function from loading content. But this is not a proper solution.\r\nUsername: `@Nikos-96`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/iiuuayfnm8ocg88s0ccskgsk0kosw0slyd42lz44xw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/kpv9zlj8uts8cwwc4wow0c4884s88ksdjaf762kim0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/kkfjr3twclscwk0gwkgkos8008s48ccpi5ax188n6s.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/dq08ql3n8wg8kkc0wokgck08wsgk0ww83kh27rjfxg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.17.1 (4709)\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 Pro, 22H2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | TDI\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (eu.tamrieltradecentre.com), <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Hide your IP address (209.141.53.254), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Disable WAP Push Message Routing Service, <br>Disable Windows Defender automatic samples submission, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://dns.adguard-dns.com`<br>filters: `User rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://eu.tamrieltradecentre.com/pc/Trade](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Feu.tamrieltradecentre.com%2Fpc%2FTrade)\r\nOther extensions used: | Dr.Web Security Space (12.0)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178495/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-03T13:26:22Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

怪异的。第一个广告看起来像是一些应用程序(Aliexpress或其他中国市场应用程序)中的内置广告。如我所见-下一个广告只是一个没有内容的占位符。你在没有AdGuard的元素中看到广告吗？我的意思是：\r\n> \r\n> 详细资料\r\n> 请删除所有以前的规则，并选中此规则\r\n> \r\n> `||wtzw.com^$app=com.kmxs.reader`\r\n> \r\n> 它可能会破坏应用程序，它只是为了测试阻止功能。\r\n\r\n清理了以前的规则，添加了新的规则后，大概过了一分钟就还是会跳出广告，我感觉这个广告应该是个元素，但是我把元素拦截功能都打开后，依然没有效果","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2093015984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-03T13:24:27Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
