email it did not refresh . If I send email it never sends.. if I disable adguard it works right away.. I can't see much in the adguard logs either ..\r\n> \r\n> Also had issues with Android auto so disabled DNS filtering which helped, Ajay issues with WhatsApp not sending images quickly (fiddle adguard and images instantly send) also mygov medicare Australian government app can't login when adguard is laoded due to blocking Google analytics it seems allowed that and seems to be working now...

Comment\r\nUsername: @Jonno-C\r\n> When adguard is enabled it's stopping me from reducing and sending emails to both of my personal IMAP accounts as well as Hotmail account as well.. when I refresh email it did not refresh . If I send email it never sends.. if I disable adguard it works right away.. I can't see much in the adguard logs either ..\r\n> \r\n> Also had issues with Android auto so disabled DNS filtering which helped, Ajay issues with WhatsApp not sending images quickly (fiddle adguard and images instantly send) also mygov medicare Australian government app can't login when adguard is laoded due to blocking Google analytics it seems allowed that and seems to be working now... Adguard really seems to be causing some major issues recently...\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/ixBoeaN.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/p6XDNMf.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.11+(54)\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Emsisoft mobile security","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/147378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/147378/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1501510664","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/147378#issuecomment-1501510664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/147378","id":1501510664,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85ZfzwI","user":{"login":"jellizaveta","id":91964807,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXtFhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91964807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta","html_url":"https://github.com/jellizaveta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-10T07:44:56Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T07:44:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, it should work.

Also, rules 2-4 do not work with the new version of the website.\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by adding the following rule (with the previous ones removed).\r\n```\r\nbilibili.com##.bili-video-card__wrap > a[href*=\"cm.bilibili.com\"]:upward(.bili-video-card)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.
