That is because coincidentally the ratio of the image creates a version with 70px height, thus you get a false positive block.\r\nUsername: `@mztechsnc`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/et38lzjmlq8048k4g0g8oc0084wggs4kqbtzyekqlc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/g89ufltfqhkcwwo400wcscw4w0c08sokngpv4p8rxs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.46\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178831/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-08T13:14:22Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
