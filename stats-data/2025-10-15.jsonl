Startpage.com displays “Sponsored” ads in search results when AdGuard’s DNS filter is updated, even if the option to unblock search ads and self-promoting ads is disabled.\r\n> \r\n> Please refer to the three attached screenshots for details.\r\n> This issue appears to be related to the closed GitHub issue #162556. https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/162556\r\n> \r\n> ⸻⸻⸻⸻\r\n> \r\n> Steps to Reproduce:\r\n> 1. Open startpage.com in Safari 26.0.1 (21622.1.22.11.15) on macOS Tahoe 26.0.1 (25A362).\r\n> 2. Search for any keyword (e.g., “lesser evil” — a snack company, or “RTX 5090”) as shown in the screenshots.\r\n> 3. Observe that “Sponsored” ads appear shortly after the search results load.\r\n> \r\n> ⸻⸻⸻⸻\r\n> \r\n> Additional Notes:\r\n> - The issue occurs 100% of the time after performing basic troubleshooting, including:\r\n> 1.

Comment\r\n> Реклама в приложении для оплаты ЖКХ \"Платосфера\", не помогает даже включение HTTPS-фильтрации для этого приложения, изначально HTTPS-фильтрация была для, него отключена, так как указано, что она может нарушить работу приложения. После включения HTTPS-фильирации реклама вида как на первом скриншоте пропала, но на следующий день снова появилась и больше не уходит, несмотря на то, что HTTPS-фильирация не отключалась. Реклама из второго скриншота (квадратные плитки вверху приложения) вообще не пропадала даже в первый день. Отловить эту рекламу в Adguard DNS Personal вручную мне не удалось, кроме того, у меня там установлены все фильтры без пометки \"problematic\" за исключением HaGeZi's URL Shortener Blocklist, HaGeZi's Allowlist Referral, HaGeZi's Anti-Piracy Blocklist, No Google, ShadowWhisperer's Dating List, но это тоже не сработало.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @Symbiote2099\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/hmzmnwp2njswo4kkgo4840oks4osw40lvgy9zqa7ls.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/sqviywybubkwg0s4owgcwgcg4ws4soojqpadjvuue8.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.12\r\nSystem version: | `Android 15`\r\nBrowser: | Приложение для оплаты ЖКХ \"Платосфера\"\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header<br><br>**Browser API**:<br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your IP address (141.255.164.210), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://xxxxxxx@d.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`, `https://d.adguard-dns.com/dns-query/xxxxxxx`, `quic://xxxxxxx.d.adguard-dns.com`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`, `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hagezi/dns-blocklists@latest/adblock/native.xiaomi.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>ROLIST2, <br/>Xfiles, <br/>YousList, <br/>Estonian List, <br/>EasyList Dutch, <br/>EasyList Portuguese, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Serbo-Croatian List, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>EasyList China, <br/>EasyList Spanish, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>road-block light, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>Polish Social Filters, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>Polish Anti-Annoying Special Supplement, <br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>Liste FR, <br/>Greek AdBlock Filter, <br/>Polish Annoyances Filters, <br/>ABPindo, <br/>Macedonian adBlock Filters, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>ROList, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>EasyList Polish, <br/>EasyList Germany, <br/>List-KR, <br/>KAD -
