Comment\r\n> Dear #AdguardTeam, Neither Adguard app nor Extension is able to block hotstar web version of Google Chrome ads (skippable or non skippable ads before starting a video stream) while Ublock Origin block all ads in hotstar web version in Kiwi and Firefox before starting a video stream, I also attached a screenshot. Kindly fix this issue as soon as possible. (Note :- I am using Adguard app with default settings also tested with easylist & easyprivacy but this also not able to block hotstar ads before starting a video stream.)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/49pvm7dcu2uc4swc8k4sgk48wkssk8wjumudv4x6tc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 28\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.1.101;4.1.101\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://unfiltered.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | One and only adguard app ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1717248141/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-13T09:11:31Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
