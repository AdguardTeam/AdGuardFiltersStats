Visit https://myanimelist.net/editprofile.php\r\n> 2. Select Dark Appearance\r\n> 3. Visit https://myanimelist.net/\r\n> 4. Observe that the two side panels have a white background.\r\n> \r\n> ## Additional Details\r\n> \r\n> The AdGuard – Ads filter list of uBlock Origin is enabled.\r\n> The list is downloaded from:\r\n> https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/ublock/filters/2_without_easylist.txt\r\n> \r\n> The list URL is mentioned in this article, so I think that it's under your control.\r\n> I can't find the rule on GitHub, though. Is it a private list?\r\n> https://adguard.com/en/blog/easylist-filter-problem-help.html\r\n> \r\n> The offending rule is:\r\n> `myanimelist.net#$#body:not(.ownlist) { background-color: #fff !important; background-image: unset !important; background-size: unset !important; background-repeat: unset !important; }`\r\n> \r\n> This issue has already been reported before.
