adshield in apkmirror.\r\nSo, after checking the adshield domain, I checked that popup filter works differently in safari.\r\nI made an exception to the shield pop-up filter and it worked well. When I turned on the adguard, the domain request seems to be blocked.\r\nIn safari, I think we need to block the pop-up in another way.\r\nSo there was no problem with Chrome and firefox, but I think it was a problem because the filter worked differently in Safari.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardForSafari/blob/master/ElectronMainApp/filters/2.txt\">Filters that are only problematic in Safari</a>\r\n\r\n2.

It lacks a specific rule to conceal the space reserved for advertisements. While on a PC, disabling the script reduces the space to zero, the scenario differs on an iPhone. Due to the persistence of the iframe, it's expected that the advertisement frame remains visible. If there's any other reason for this issue, please let me know for future reference.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/agpzif1yjhssgks8gocows80g0ogo8getmmmu77qyg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175486/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-22T06:11:11Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Adguard on iPhone struggles to manage iframes effectively. It lacks a specific rule to conceal the space reserved for advertisements. While on a PC, disabling the script reduces the space to zero, the scenario differs on an iPhone. Due to the persistence of the iframe, it's expected that the advertisement frame remains visible. If there's any other reason for this issue, please let me know for future reference.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/agpzif1yjhssgks8gocows80g0ogo8getmmmu77qyg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.3\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175486/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-22T08:27:17Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

you are right the question about https filtering is worth including in the bug report. AdGuard for Mac has many advantages over the safari extension because the extension has safari browser restrictions on the number of rules used in content blockers . Because of the limitations, AdGuard for Safari uses optimized filter sheets. If some applications do not work well with https filtering enabled - you can remove these applications from the list of automatically filtered applications. (`Network --> General --> Automatically filter applications --> uncheck applications that do not work properly`).\r\nAdGuard for Mac has more functionality and works better on sites that require advanced blocking, as there are no issues with the Safari restrictions that the AdGuard extension for Safari has. But here of course the choice is yours whether you need the extra options.\r\n\r\nIf the ads are now blocked correctly, then I'm closing the issue. If you have any questions or issues with ad blocking, feel free to mention me. Thank you for your feedback!

It worked great for a month then stopped working. The problem occurs on twitch only, after clicking on a channel and \"blocking ads\" disappears in  the top left hand corner, the stream freezes(loading icon) and doesn't not load at all. The only work around I have  found is to use the \"do not filter for 30 seconds\".  But then I am watching ads. I did not include any relevant photos as it is a simple freezing error about 30 seconds into the  stream.

This site has been reported several times for the same thing: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169273\r\n> \r\n> Basically, they change the domain suffix every couple of months to get around filters. Which is exactly what happened this week. So now, every time you load the page with AdGuard there's several popups, fake chats, full screen hidden links to more ads etc. I know the screenshot doesn't show it, but it was required and I took it with a working blocker due to loads of NSFW stuff popping up.\r\n> \r\n> Wouldn't it be better to add a \"global\" permanent block like \"clicknupload.*\" against the injected ads?

This site has been reported several times for the same thing: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169273\r\n> \r\n> Basically, they change the domain suffix every couple of months to get around filters. Which is exactly what happened this week. So now, every time you load the page with AdGuard there's several popups, fake chats, full screen hidden links to more ads etc. I know the screenshot doesn't show it, but it was required and I took it with a working blocker due to loads of NSFW stuff popping up.\r\n> \r\n> Wouldn't it be better to add a \"global\" permanent block like \"clicknupload.*\" against the injected ads? I believe Ublock uses that for this very site.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/55aehhysxs84ks0w84ks484cc8408wsbqi1bf8rk8o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.16\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Popups<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175003/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-22T16:51:03Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
