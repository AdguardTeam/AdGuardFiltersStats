adshield in apkmirror.\r\nSo, after checking the adshield domain, I checked that popup filter works differently in safari.\r\nI made an exception to the shield pop-up filter and it worked well. When I turned on the adguard, the domain request seems to be blocked.\r\nIn safari, I think we need to block the pop-up in another way.\r\nSo there was no problem with Chrome and firefox, but I think it was a problem because the filter worked differently in Safari.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardForSafari/blob/master/ElectronMainApp/filters/2.txt\">Filters that are only problematic in Safari</a>\r\n\r\n2.
