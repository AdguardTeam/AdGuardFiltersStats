theAdGuard URL Tracking Protection list enabled and searching on DuckDuckGo with a region selected the result doesn't consider the selected region, the language, nor the effective IP of origin (I'm not using a VPN) but forces the engine to show results as if the search was defaulted to United States (Eng) (/ All Regions?).\r\n> Even changing region to others, like Germany or France or whatever still shows the same US/Eng based results, the only thing changing is the Wikipedia summary on the side that actually follows the selected region.\r\n> Even the correlated searches defaults to US/Eng instead of changing to the corresponding region.\r\n> That's the only list enabled or disabled for the test, no other extension active, Firefox on Normal Mode, so nothing else changing except the AdGuard URL Tracking Protection list being enabled or disabled.\r\n> Cookies are new, since they get deleted every time I reboot the browser and the results are consistent just by checking or unchecking the list.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
