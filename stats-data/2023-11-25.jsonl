И вроде как проблема исчезла. Сайты, вроде не ломаются и работают корректно. Вероятно, проблема с синтаксисом правил, который по какой-то причине стал несовместим на прошлой версии AdGuard 3.6.11(54).

with the option to be previewed within the Search page, clicking the [expand video] button/icon or the [play video] button/icon does nothing – if the page has been scrolled down, clicking those buttons will set the scroll position to its start;\r\n> - Both of these issues happen only under the general search feature (as far as I've tested) – not on the main google.com page nor within a

С 24-го числа базовый фильтр (https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/2_optimized.txt) начал ломать pikabu.ru и disk.yandex.ru. Возможно поломано что-то ещё. На pikabu перестают работать скрипты и сайт практически полностью становится нефункциональным. На яндекс - диске отваливается скачивание файлов и веювинг содержимого архивов (да и всё остально, в принципе). Дезактивация подписки проблему убирает, подписка была самой свежей. Всё ломается при наличии её одной, даже если деактивировать прочие подписки. Добавление вышеозначенных сайтов в исключение ничего не даёт. Ломаются какие-то внешние элементы/скрипты. Юзается хром 90.0.4430.210 Safari с десктопным UA. Версии выше для меня неюзабельны по причине упоротого вкладочного интерфейса. Я бы галку, что \"у меня браузер последней версии\" и не ставил бы, равно как и галку напротив подтверждения, что \"у меня последняя версия AdGuard\" (т.к. на 5.1 выше не обновишь), но ваша форма иначе запостить не даёт. \r\n\r\nupd: Убрал.\r\n\r\nupd: Ещё ломает https://profile.mts.ru - там бесконечный спиннер и страница не грузится.
