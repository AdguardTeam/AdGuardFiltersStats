Comment\r\n> ## Description\r\n> The website contains a video player named **\"Multi HD\"** that appears to use a highly sophisticated adblock-detection mechanism.\r\n> \r\n> When an ad blocker is enabled, the player displays the first overlay:\r\n> > *\"You are using AdBlocker. The owner of this video doesn't allow AdBlocker. Please disable your AdBlocker, Thank you.\"*\r\n> \r\n> If this overlay is manually blocked, the player shows a second overlay:\r\n> > *\"Video keep loading? Select a different server or refresh the page.\"*\r\n> \r\n> From my observation, once adblock usage is detected, the **actual video player** is never loaded at all. Instead, it is replaced entirely with one of these two overlays. This means the real video stream never initiates when adblock is detected.\r\n> \r\n> ---\r\n> \r\n> ## Steps to Reproduce\r\n> 1. Enable any ad blocker (AdGuard, uBlock Origin, etc.).\r\n> 2. Open the website containing the **\"Multi HD\"** player.\r\n> 3. Notice the first overlay appears.\r\n> 4. Block the first overlay element (e.g., via cosmetic filter).\r\n> 5. A second overlay appears instead, with no real video loaded.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/8iqc2bg77ew4wksc48w0w8sock00k00kme7zf7fw68.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.102 MV2\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries<br><br>**Browser API**:<br>Block WebRTC<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `None`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210493/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-08-01T04:26:24Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
