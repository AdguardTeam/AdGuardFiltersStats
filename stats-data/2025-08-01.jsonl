Comment\r\n> ## Description\r\n> The website contains a video player named **\"Multi HD\"** that appears to use a highly sophisticated adblock-detection mechanism.\r\n> \r\n> When an ad blocker is enabled, the player displays the first overlay:\r\n> > *\"You are using AdBlocker. The owner of this video doesn't allow AdBlocker. Please disable your AdBlocker, Thank you.\"*\r\n> \r\n> If this overlay is manually blocked, the player shows a second overlay:\r\n> > *\"Video keep loading? Select a different server or refresh the page.\"*\r\n> \r\n> From my observation, once adblock usage is detected, the **actual video player** is never loaded at all. Instead, it is replaced entirely with one of these two overlays. This means the real video stream never initiates when adblock is detected.\r\n> \r\n> ---\r\n> \r\n> ## Steps to Reproduce\r\n> 1. Enable any ad blocker (AdGuard, uBlock Origin, etc.).\r\n> 2. Open the website containing the **\"Multi HD\"** player.\r\n> 3. Notice the first overlay appears.\r\n> 4. Block the first overlay element (e.g., via cosmetic filter).\r\n> 5. A second overlay appears instead, with no real video loaded.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/8iqc2bg77ew4wksc48w0w8sock00k00kme7zf7fw68.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.102 MV2\r\nSystem version: | `Windows 10`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries<br><br>**Browser API**:<br>Block WebRTC<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `None`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210493/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-08-01T04:26:24Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> When using the search function on Pinterest, it brings you to a different page; however, with Adguard enabled, it does not let you scroll on it, so the page is frozen. The only way for it to work is for Adguard to be disabled, but then the ads reappear. However, the Pinterest home page that comes up does not have this issue anymore. It used to also be frozen until Adguard was disabled, and you were allowed to scroll again. When clicking on a pin itself, it lets you scroll fine, and you do not need Adguard disabled.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Steps: Go onto Pintrest, search something in the search bar, try and scroll.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/87y7qdbxd5s08c08ws4ko0oo08gk0sgamy164nec8w.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.121 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Mac OS 15.5.0`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | `Grammerly, Prowriting aid, Read aloud: text to speech, Stacker - falling blocks!`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3144780831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-08-01T14:27:38Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
