Comment\r\n> Trying to watch Hulu on Safari with the AdGuard for Safari extension active, however there are still ads popping up at the start of each new episode. I also notice the runtime for these episodes are longer and the ads are a part of the runtime. I have the AdGuard extension installed on Google Chrome as well with the same exact settings and Hulu works perfectly fine over there. Normal episode runtime and all ads are blocked without issues.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/wd8baevxfjkswk80oo400w0s0k8w08ilcz7v1zf3co.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.22\r\nSystem version: | `MacOS Sequoia 15.5`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nOther extensions used: | `Surfshark, PayPal Honey, Teleparty`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/212218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/212218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3235521995","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/212218#issuecomment-3235521995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/212218","id":3235521995,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87A2iXL","user":{"login":"BlazDT","id":34266271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjY2Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34266271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT","html_url":"https://github.com/BlazDT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-29T02:36:20Z","updated_at":"2025-08-29T02:36:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Usually it should display ad breaks when ads are not blocked.\nBut according to screenshots those are missing and it is also not showing there is an ad playing.\n\nCurrently Hulu on Safari is showng only white screen.
