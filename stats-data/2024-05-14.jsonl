Comment\r\n> The AdGuard Social Media filter causes issues for The Wall Street Journal (wsj.com) when I want to obtain an \"Unlocked Link\" to share with people.  I have a free subscription that's through an educational institution so I make use of it by sharing no paywall links, like the below: \r\n> \r\n> https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/ai-job-application-685f29f7?st=oo90f1uo7tqdv9f&reflink=mobilewebshare_permalink \r\n> \r\n> However, on both desktop with uBlock Origin & Android on AdGuard, the AdGuard Social Media filter will totally block the share button, making it impossible to get the Unlocked Article link.  \r\n> \r\n> I've enabled it and disabled it and tested repeatedly, I understand the desire to ban the bad social widgets but the WSJ one has a very useful need to exist. \r\n> \r\n> If this could be adjusted for both desktop & mobile I would love it.  Thank you. Let me know if there are any questions. \r\nUsername: `@vondubenshire`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tu73p1o5exccc4kss0ccs4scsoc8s4caeydu65isc0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/skw70c4dbi80w44g8cw4s0osg84ow8geklw2xcofds.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8uihodt7d1k48gw40sco8cw8goo4oskir6921jlb2g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/eetiu0fe40g8cgso8wgs8koso8w080gtrh0btsaetc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/o5uen7t8h2sc0g0gc4ko0kg4wwwg0g4kcbv7duaf8g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 6</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 6](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/nxhmz95k6j48wow44gsw04kwk0g4k1e3td3jbohj44.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.4 Nightly 46\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>AdGuard Experimental\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2109349340","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179187#issuecomment-2109349340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179187","id":2109349340,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM859uh3c","user":{"login":"vonDubenshire","id":40748193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzQ4MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40748193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonDubenshire","html_url":"https://github.com/vonDubenshire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonDubenshire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonDubenshire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonDubenshire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonDubenshire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonDubenshire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonDubenshire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonDubenshire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonDubenshire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonDubenshire/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-14T06:00:17Z","updated_at":"2024-05-14T06:00:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @vonDubenshire Blocking social widget is an intended behavior of AdGuard Social filter. If you want to share a URL with bypassing paywall, please disable the filter.\r\n\r\nI understand, but I do not have this issue with another website I can share unlocked articles with -- \"nytimes.com\" , where the Unlocked Article sharing is still there with the social filter enabled (mobile and desktop).  \r\n\r\nI was looking for any minor modification that could be made or exception for this particular type of share widget, since it is so non-invasive. \r\n\r\nThe type of share widget I always assumed the filter was intended for are things like the global share widget websites, or the garbage you see on an unfiltered AndroidPolice page: \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/40748193/4d743d6e-5421-4965-81e9-232f6cf9326d)\r\n \r\nAnyway, is that a possibility or do I need to just accept I'll need a user rule for that if I want to keep using the social widget filter.  \r\n\r\nI noticed Fanboy's does not block that particular one, by the way, though I do not know the intricacies of the difference in his and AdGuard's. \r\n\r\nThanks for the reply!

I have a free subscription that's through an educational institution so I make use of it by sharing no paywall links, like the below: \r\n> \r\n> https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/ai-job-application-685f29f7?st=oo90f1uo7tqdv9f&reflink=mobilewebshare_permalink \r\n> \r\n> However, on both desktop with uBlock Origin & Android on AdGuard, the AdGuard Social Media filter will totally block the share button, making it impossible to get the Unlocked Article link.  \r\n> \r\n> I've enabled it and disabled it and tested repeatedly, I understand the desire to ban the bad social widgets but the WSJ one has a very useful need to exist. \r\n> \r\n> If this could be adjusted for both desktop & mobile I would love it.  Thank you. Let me know if there are any questions. \r\nUsername: `@vondubenshire`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tu73p1o5exccc4kss0ccs4scsoc8s4caeydu65isc0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/skw70c4dbi80w44g8cw4s0osg84ow8geklw2xcofds.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8uihodt7d1k48gw40sco8cw8goo4oskir6921jlb2g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/eetiu0fe40g8cgso8wgs8koso8w080gtrh0btsaetc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/o5uen7t8h2sc0g0gc4ko0kg4wwwg0g4kcbv7duaf8g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 6</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 6](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/nxhmz95k6j48wow44gsw04kwk0g4k1e3td3jbohj44.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.4 Nightly 46\r\nSystem version: | Android 14\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>AdGuard Experimental\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2109315316","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179187#issuecomment-2109315316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179187","id":2109315316,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM859uZj0","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-14T05:28:22Z","updated_at":"2024-05-14T05:28:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vondubenshire Blocking social widget is an intended behavior of AdGuard Social filter.\r\nIf you want to share a URL with bypassing paywall, please disable the filter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2109315316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-14T05:28:24Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Hi I can't reproduce it.

However, I have continued to have this issue with both uBlock Origin default filters and my custom ones, as well as AdGuard with a clean installation of default filters. \r\n\r\nIt **could** be a filter issue but I have yet to figure out which one it is by toggling on a single one at a time.\r\n\r\nI have found that telling your browser to block JavaScript for \"www.theatlantic.com\" **will** block the paywall sign-in from loading (it must be www., for whatever reason, at least in Chromium browsers). \r\n\r\nI still have the same sign-in as I showed above on almost every article at www.theatlantic.com \r\n\r\nIf you are still unable to reproduce, let me know how best to start testing to diagnose if\\which filter this may be from. \r\n\r\nI have the same issue(s) on any browser on any device (I use macOS, ChromeOS, Windows 11, iOS and Android -- all with various browsers, but mostly Chrome.)

Comment\r\n> The AdGuard Social Media filter causes issues for The Wall Street Journal (wsj.com) when I want to obtain an \"Unlocked Link\" to share with people.  I have a free subscription that's through an educational institution so I make use of it by sharing no paywall links, like the below: \r\n> \r\n> https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/ai-job-application-685f29f7?st=oo90f1uo7tqdv9f&reflink=mobilewebshare_permalink \r\n> \r\n> However, on both desktop with uBlock Origin & Android on AdGuard, the AdGuard Social Media filter will totally block the share button, making it impossible to get the Unlocked Article link.  \r\n> \r\n> I've enabled it and disabled it and tested repeatedly, I understand the desire to ban the bad social widgets but the WSJ one has a very useful need to exist. \r\n> \r\n> If this could be adjusted for both desktop & mobile I would love it.
