дико извиняюсь, пришлось восстановить свой акк здесь на github, но скорее всего проблема не в DNS (у меня DNS Яндекса по DoH, тут указано), просто сейчас я везде авторизовываюсь после чистки кешей, куки и DNS кэша винды, поставил DNS Яндекса и все сайты пока что медленно грузятся, но временно, такое у меня бывало на кастомных DNS, сейчас я разлогинился на Ali, снова авторизовался, попробовал DNS Cloudflare и картинка прорисовалась. Просто вначале, когда я только заходил, почему-то не работало. Наверно можно запрос закрывать, или ещё лучше удалить, потому что я забыл затереть своё местоположение на картинках.

Сам проверить не могу. Некоторые банковские приложения действуют аналогично. И не важно - реальный ВПН или локальный (как в случае с Адгардом при использовании фильтрации DNS - трафик не маршрутизируется на наши серверы). Если выключите фильтрацию DNS - проблема скорее всего решится.\r\nМожете проверить с любым ВПН с не-российской локацией. \r\n\r\n> В общем, статистику себе улучшаете, всё понятно.\r\n\r\nПатчить приложения мы не можем. Apple даже не разрешает фильтрацию HTTPS.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2273452108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-07T13:16:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
