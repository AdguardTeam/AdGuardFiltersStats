I can't stand Spotify and was simply looking to grab the playlist and migrate it to Apple Music. I thought it was a very interesting problem I'd never came across so thought to pass it along.  One more interesting bit, same behaviour using laptop speakers, as well as a VM with a sound card adapter; it's definitely not unique to a specfic OS. \r\nUsername: `@9f4KPA72Yqeztf8a`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ivk4ay3wttwk80g4g880ss4o0cc8so8b9astkhzcig.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4n5suigivuo0g8owgwcwg0g4kww04ggskft75fhpr4.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.13.0.1558 release\r\nSystem version: | MacOS Sonoma 14.3.1\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Hide your IP address (Varies), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://d.adguard-dns.com/dns-query/xxxxxxx`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/mac_v2/filters/15.txt`, `DnsUserRules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)<br>Web of Trust (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js)<br>AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nReferrer: | [https://open.spotify.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | None; I don't run any A/V nor any other obtrusive apps","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-04T06:15:23Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> I can't show it via screenshots but the issue is songs play with no music at the beginning unless I fiddle with my Aèropods Pro, Screw around with my volume, pause and resume the website's controls AND screw with the volume control with Spotify. I can't stand Spotify and was simply looking to grab the playlist and migrate it to Apple Music. I thought it was a very interesting problem I'd never came across so thought to pass it along.  One more interesting bit, same behaviour using laptop speakers, as well as a VM with a sound card adapter; it's definitely not unique to a specfic OS. \r\nUsername: `@9f4KPA72Yqeztf8a`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ivk4ay3wttwk80g4g880ss4o0cc8so8b9astkhzcig.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4n5suigivuo0g8owgwcwg0g4kww04ggskft75fhpr4.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.13.0.1558 release\r\nSystem version: | MacOS Sonoma 14.3.1\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Hide your IP address (Varies), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://d.adguard-dns.com/dns-query/xxxxxxx`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/mac_v2/filters/15.txt`, `DnsUserRules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)<br>Web of Trust (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js)<br>AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nReferrer: | [https://open.spotify.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | None; I don't run any A/V nor any other obtrusive apps","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1975938943","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174034#issuecomment-1975938943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174034","id":1975938943,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM851xm9_","user":{"login":"9f4KPA72Yqeztf8a","id":20617809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjE3ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20617809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/9f4KPA72Yqeztf8a","html_url":"https://github.com/9f4KPA72Yqeztf8a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/9f4KPA72Yqeztf8a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/9f4KPA72Yqeztf8a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/9f4KPA72Yqeztf8a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/9f4KPA72Yqeztf8a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/9f4KPA72Yqeztf8a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/9f4KPA72Yqeztf8a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/9f4KPA72Yqeztf8a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/9f4KPA72Yqeztf8a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/9f4KPA72Yqeztf8a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-04T08:02:56Z","updated_at":"2024-03-04T08:02:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I appreciate the quick reply and confirmation that it is a filter of some sort on my end.

Comment\r\n> I can't show it via screenshots but the issue is songs play with no music at the beginning unless I fiddle with my Aèropods Pro, Screw around with my volume, pause and resume the website's controls AND screw with the volume control with Spotify. I can't stand Spotify and was simply looking to grab the playlist and migrate it to Apple Music. I thought it was a very interesting problem I'd never came across so thought to pass it along.

Comment\r\n> I can't show it via screenshots but the issue is songs play with no music at the beginning unless I fiddle with my Aèropods Pro, Screw around with my volume, pause and resume the website's controls AND screw with the volume control with Spotify. I can't stand Spotify and was simply looking to grab the playlist and migrate it to Apple Music. I thought it was a very interesting problem I'd never came across so thought to pass it along.  One more interesting bit, same behaviour using laptop speakers, as well as a VM with a sound card adapter; it's definitely not unique to a specfic OS. \r\nUsername: `@9f4KPA72Yqeztf8a`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ivk4ay3wttwk80g4g880ss4o0cc8so8b9astkhzcig.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4n5suigivuo0g8owgwcwg0g4kww04ggskft75fhpr4.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.13.0.1558 release\r\nSystem version: | MacOS Sonoma 14.3.1\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Hide your IP address (Varies), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://d.adguard-dns.com/dns-query/xxxxxxx`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/mac_v2/filters/15.txt`, `DnsUserRules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)<br>Web of Trust (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js)<br>AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nReferrer: | [https://open.spotify.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | None; I don't run any A/V nor any other obtrusive apps","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-04T08:19:57Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
