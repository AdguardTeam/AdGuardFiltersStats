DNS过滤器禁止了，所以这个软件就会通过IP绕过封禁，从url内容可以知道这是用于跟踪的，会上传操作系统信息，软件版本号等等。我就通过禁止IP来阻挡，当然还有另一种方法，为了方便，假设host后面的域名为A。 `||*A*`  这条规则能拦截下面的url，我试过了，并且对软件使用没有任何不利影响。我推荐使用通配符。\n我建议将新规则添加到Adguard DNS过滤器和Adguard 防跟踪过滤器中。host后面的域名已经被你的DNS过滤器拦截，你们只需要在原有的规则上加上 `*`\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b7436f4-5f06-4c65-b6e6-74ce22a33884)\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this
