I also notice the runtime for these episodes are longer and the ads are a part of the runtime. I have the AdGuard extension installed on Google Chrome as well with the same exact settings and Hulu works perfectly fine over there.

(Steps to Reproduce):**\r\n> 1. 在乾淨的瀏覽器環境中安裝 AdGuard 擴充功能。\r\n> 2. 啟用預設的過濾器清單 (例如：AdGuard 基礎過濾器、追蹤防護、中文過濾器等)。\r\n> 3. 前往 https://www.threads.net/\r\n> 4. 觀察到頁面呈現空白，且瀏覽器分頁圖示顯示正在持續重新載入。\r\n> \r\n> **已進行的故障排除 (Troubleshooting Done):**\r\n> 確認問題僅在 AdGuard 啟用時發生，停用對該網站的防護後即可正常瀏覽。同時，已停用所有其他的廣告封鎖擴充功能，以確認問題來源為 AdGuard 的過濾規則。\r\n```\r\nUsername: @wu858430049\r\n```\r\n\r\n###
