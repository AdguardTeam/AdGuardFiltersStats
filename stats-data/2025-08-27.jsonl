I also notice the runtime for these episodes are longer and the ads are a part of the runtime. I have the AdGuard extension installed on Google Chrome as well with the same exact settings and Hulu works perfectly fine over there.

(Steps to Reproduce):**\r\n> 1. 在乾淨的瀏覽器環境中安裝 AdGuard 擴充功能。\r\n> 2. 啟用預設的過濾器清單 (例如：AdGuard 基礎過濾器、追蹤防護、中文過濾器等)。\r\n> 3. 前往 https://www.threads.net/\r\n> 4. 觀察到頁面呈現空白，且瀏覽器分頁圖示顯示正在持續重新載入。\r\n> \r\n> **已進行的故障排除 (Troubleshooting Done):**\r\n> 確認問題僅在 AdGuard 啟用時發生，停用對該網站的防護後即可正常瀏覽。同時，已停用所有其他的廣告封鎖擴充功能，以確認問題來源為 AdGuard 的過濾規則。\r\n```\r\nUsername: @wu858430049\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

not so familiar with AdGuard Content Blocker for Android.\nAccording to [documentation ](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#basic-rules-basic-modifiers) `$important` modifier is not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker for Android, so it's probably a reason why  `elemhide,important` exclusion is ignored.\nThere is also `@@||focus.de^$generichide` in German filter, so I'm not sure which rule has higher priority in case if `elemhide` is used without `important`.\nI guess that for ad-reinjection is recommended to install AdGuard for

(Steps to Reproduce):**\r\n> 1. 在乾淨的瀏覽器環境中安裝 AdGuard 擴充功能。\r\n> 2. 啟用預設的過濾器清單 (例如：AdGuard 基礎過濾器、追蹤防護、中文過濾器等)。\r\n> 3. 前往 https://www.threads.net/\r\n> 4. 觀察到頁面呈現空白，且瀏覽器分頁圖示顯示正在持續重新載入。\r\n> \r\n> **已進行的故障排除 (Troubleshooting Done):**\r\n> 確認問題僅在 AdGuard 啟用時發生，停用對該網站的防護後即可正常瀏覽。同時，已停用所有其他的廣告封鎖擴充功能，以確認問題來源為 AdGuard 的過濾規則。\r\n```\r\nUsername: @wu858430049\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

be\n\n```\n||static-tracking.klaviyo.com/onsite/*\n```\nwhich blocks any analytics scripts/API requests/etc that Klaviyo uses for shopper identification.\n\nWe should _not_ be blocking requests to `a.klaviyo.com`. That rule should be removed.\n\n### Additional information\n\nA similar issue was submitted: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210120#issuecomment-3128250521\n\nBut the fix implemented was not the proposed solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3227611772","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210537#issuecomment-3227611772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210537","id":3227611772,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87AYXJ8","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-27T10:15:35Z","updated_at":"2025-08-27T10:15:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@owen-carpenter-klaviyo Ok, could you please provide an example of affected site, and what exactly must be checked?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3227611772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-08-27T10:15:36Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
