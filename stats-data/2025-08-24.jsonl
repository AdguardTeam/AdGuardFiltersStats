ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.

Even on Desktop, when AdGuard DNS was configured at browser level, the website didn't load BUT when used system-wide configuration, the website loaded.\nI think something is happening behind-the-scene while resolving the IP. As some of my tests showed that the domain owner is using Cloudflare for the IP resolution or something related to it.
