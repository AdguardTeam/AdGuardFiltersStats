ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.

Even on Desktop, when AdGuard DNS was configured at browser level, the website didn't load BUT when used system-wide configuration, the website loaded.\nI think something is happening behind-the-scene while resolving the IP. As some of my tests showed that the domain owner is using Cloudflare for the IP resolution or something related to it.

I am still able to rollover images and get popups, so it's not completely frozen. \n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6080a47-f108-4a6d-82c1-fe0e27d57574","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3218353164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-08-24T20:18:23Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
