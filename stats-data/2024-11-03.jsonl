@liurefaiwueb Does it happen when all filters are disabled? Don't know how to help without an ability to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nyes, This all happened even with filters turned off and just Adguard enabled. After the reset, Adguard worked fine for a while, so I tried to find out if there was a change in the firewall or any settings between when it was working and when it started having problems, but I couldn't find anything. To summarize, after installing and using Adguard, Calm.com/app doesn't work properly in safari, and in other browsers, Adguard is often detected on Calm.com. Since the above problem is only on my computer, and it always happens even after a factory reset, I've given up on blocking ads and am now using Mac natively. And living with ads doesn't seem as inconvenient as I thought it would be. I think this is definitely a problem with my computer. Let's end this issue at this point, thanks for all your hard work!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2453280395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-03T03:37:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Используется обход блокировки для рф (https://github.com/bol-van/zapret-win-bundle). Интересно то, что пару недель назад все работало нормально. Сначала думал на днс, отключил в adguard фильтрацию dns, но не помогло. Добавил в роутере открытые dns Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1), но при включенном adguard не работает ни сайт ни приложение. Как только отключаю adguard сразу начинает грузиться и сайт и приложение.\r\nUsername: `@https://github.com/6epcepkep`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/r7moah104is4g4swcsskk0ssg8oog806gpax93wkjg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/odou0q32gv4k0cw8ogko0k8goo80cc4cxmxwhylai8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.19.0 (4853) (CL 1.16.44, DL 2.5.41 )\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 Домашняя для одного языка 22H2 19045.5073\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your IP address (14.88.10.101), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies, <br>Block trackers, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.info/settings/import.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Flogin%3Fredirect_to%3D%252Foauth2%252Fauthorize%253Fresponse_type%253Dcode%2526client_id%253D493224032167002123%2526redirect_uri%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fdiscords.com%25252Fauth%25252Fdiscord%25252Fcallback%2526scope%253Dguilds%252Bidentify%252Bguilds.join%2526state%253DPNaSf2TnXChBEhvloLjtNXhRsPEMhu)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192194/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-03T16:30:52Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
