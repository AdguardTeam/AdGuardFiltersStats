Comment\r\nUsername: @G-Terov\r\n> Здравствуйте. \r\n> \r\n> Столкнулся со всплывающим баннером на сайте fast-torrent.ru. Появляется он примерно на 3-5 минуте воспроизведения видео. Если закрыть его, то через некоторое время опять открывается. Выбрать элемент и заблокировать вручную нельзя т.к. баннер закрывается, а воспроизведение прекращается и также потом опять открывается через какое-то время. Можно это видеть на одном скриншоте со заштрихованным квадратом и логотипом флешплеера. На двух скриншотах можно видеть элементы которые выводят баннер, может вам это будет полезно. Также пробовал его закрыть в коде через display: none. Но это конечно временная мера до перезагрузки страницы.

Появляется он примерно на 3-5 минуте воспроизведения видео. Если закрыть его, то через некоторое время опять открывается. Выбрать элемент и заблокировать вручную нельзя т.к. баннер закрывается, а воспроизведение прекращается и также потом опять открывается через какое-то время. Можно это видеть на одном скриншоте со заштрихованным квадратом и логотипом флешплеера. На двух скриншотах можно видеть элементы которые выводят баннер, может вам это будет полезно. Также пробовал его закрыть в коде через display: none. Но это конечно временная мера до перезагрузки страницы. Надеюсь вы обратите внимание на проблему и нивелируете потуги хитрых рекламистов.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/rzU2PuQ.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/DTMMtkg.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/TEPTsMZ.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Sa34sNW.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.1\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (www.fast-torrent.ru), <br>Hide your User-Agent ()\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns-unfiltered.adguard.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `User+rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>Bulgarian list, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>Hungarian</details>\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Norton Security","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/138093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/138093/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-12-22T16:05:21Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
