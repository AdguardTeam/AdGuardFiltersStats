wasnt working right, and right when you fixed that is when more ads started showing many places including this site and youtube and others.  i dont like taking the time to fill this form, probably makes you get a lot less feedback than if we could right click on a bad element and report it with what you need.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n
