The share panel in the shorts player doesn't have an embed button and a social icon (either WhatsApp if you're logged out or Facebook if you're logged in) wasn't being affected by the old filter. With this fix it should work both on the normal and the shorts player. I also removed the filter: `youtube.com##button[title=\"WhatsApp\"]` because it shouldn't be needed anymore.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Before:</summary>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/27850212c333e6fc4e6d9b504781dfd0f77e0d96ad8cb3cf734933b5bd401029/68747470733a2f2f7265706f7274732d696d672e616467756172642e636f6d2f513746447566672e706e67\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>After:</summary>\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/106120144/278388ae-9c8f-49a0-a830-9b47fdf814c1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are met\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150925/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150925/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1552818077","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pull/150925#issuecomment-1552818077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150925","id":1552818077,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85cjh-d","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-18T09:56:25Z","updated_at":"2023-05-18T09:56:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok, added `youtube.com##button[title=\"Facebook\"]`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1552818077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-18T09:56:26Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Instead, I believe that they rely on HTTP requests, cookies, and browser storage to determine my color scheme, which AdGuard could block.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/F7MlO6r.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/GocR9WR.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.10.0.1272 release\r\nBrowser: | Arc\r\nStealth mode options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/mac_v2/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters\r\nUserscripts: | Web of Trust (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js),<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js),<br>AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.google.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | AdGuard Browser Assistant","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1552887447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-18T10:59:28Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Android device (Google Pixel 2XL) when AdGuard is running. \r\n> When I try to login I receive an error saying \"Connection required. Please try again when you're back online\".\r\n> I have looked in the filtering log and occasionally see requests being blocked, but not every time I try to log in, only occasionally. I have tried adding exceptions for the requests being blocked, but this doesn't seem to have helped (even after a restart and shoppix-app reinstall). \r\n> If I disable 'Route traffic through AdGuard' for this specific app in the AdGuard settings, I am able to login in again.

Comment\r\nUsername: @mattjbr123\r\n> I'm having an issue with the 'Shoppix' app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kantarworldpanel.shoppix&hl=en_GB&gl=US&pli=1) installed on my Android device (Google Pixel 2XL) when AdGuard is running. \r\n> When I try to login I receive an error saying \"Connection required. Please try again when you're back online\".\r\n> I have looked in the filtering log and occasionally see requests being blocked, but not every time I try to log in, only occasionally. I have tried adding exceptions for the requests being blocked, but this doesn't seem to have helped (even after a restart and shoppix-app reinstall). \r\n> If I disable 'Route traffic through AdGuard' for this specific app in the AdGuard settings, I am able to login in again. If I then re-enable 'Route traffic through AdGuard' whilst the shoppix app is still running, it acts as if it doesn't have an internet connection, insisting that it is offline. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/RwqiFAn.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/21n4o6I.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.0.788\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS (DNS-over-HTTPS)`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nUserscripts: | If extensions have become userscripts in the beta, then I use AdGuard extension. \r\nThe beta also doesn't appear to have stealth mode as an option, or filtering method (high quality Vs high speed)\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1553557835","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998#issuecomment-1553557835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998","id":1553557835,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85cmWlL","user":{"login":"mattjbr123","id":47819526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODE5NTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47819526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattjbr123","html_url":"https://github.com/mattjbr123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattjbr123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattjbr123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattjbr123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattjbr123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattjbr123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattjbr123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattjbr123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattjbr123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattjbr123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-18T19:42:18Z","updated_at":"2023-05-18T19:42:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi ,\r\nIt works in the latter two cases, the ones with HTTPS filtering disabled:\r\n    HTTPS filtering in network settings - disabled, DNS filtering - disabled\r\n    HTTPS filtering in network settings - disabled, DNS filtering - enabled\r\n\r\nI think I may have originally downloaded the app from somewhere like APKpure too, come to think of it.

Comment\r\nUsername: @mattjbr123\r\n> I'm having an issue with the 'Shoppix' app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kantarworldpanel.shoppix&hl=en_GB&gl=US&pli=1) installed on my Android device (Google Pixel 2XL) when AdGuard is running. \r\n> When I try to login I receive an error saying \"Connection required.

I have tried adding exceptions for the requests being blocked, but this doesn't seem to have helped (even after a restart and shoppix-app reinstall). \r\n> If I disable 'Route traffic through AdGuard' for this specific app in the AdGuard settings, I am able to login in again. If I then re-enable 'Route traffic through AdGuard' whilst the shoppix app is still running, it acts as if it doesn't have an internet connection, insisting that it is offline. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/RwqiFAn.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/21n4o6I.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.0.788\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS (DNS-over-HTTPS)`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nUserscripts: | If extensions have become userscripts in the beta, then I use AdGuard extension. \r\nThe beta also doesn't appear to have stealth mode as an option, or filtering method (high quality Vs high speed)\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1553639928","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998#issuecomment-1553639928","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150998","id":1553639928,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85cmqn4","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-18T21:02:13Z","updated_at":"2023-05-18T21:02:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok.

Not sure if there will be file size limits if I upload , but I'll try.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1553661684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-18T21:21:50Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
