The share panel in the shorts player doesn't have an embed button and a social icon (either WhatsApp if you're logged out or Facebook if you're logged in) wasn't being affected by the old filter. With this fix it should work both on the normal and the shorts player. I also removed the filter: `youtube.com##button[title=\"WhatsApp\"]` because it shouldn't be needed anymore.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Before:</summary>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/27850212c333e6fc4e6d9b504781dfd0f77e0d96ad8cb3cf734933b5bd401029/68747470733a2f2f7265706f7274732d696d672e616467756172642e636f6d2f513746447566672e706e67\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>After:</summary>\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/106120144/278388ae-9c8f-49a0-a830-9b47fdf814c1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are met\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150925/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150925/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1552818077","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pull/150925#issuecomment-1552818077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150925","id":1552818077,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85cjh-d","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-18T09:56:25Z","updated_at":"2023-05-18T09:56:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok, added `youtube.com##button[title=\"Facebook\"]`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1552818077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-18T09:56:26Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @exsesx\r\n> AdGuard somehow messes up Google's \"device default\" appearance setting, so google.com cannot determine my device preferred color scheme. JS in the console works correctly, but the website doesn't respect the prefers-color-scheme media query. Instead, I believe that they rely on HTTP requests, cookies, and browser storage to determine my color scheme, which AdGuard could block.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/F7MlO6r.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/GocR9WR.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.10.0.1272 release\r\nBrowser: | Arc\r\nStealth mode options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/mac_v2/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters\r\nUserscripts: | Web of Trust (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js),<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js),<br>AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.google.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | AdGuard Browser Assistant","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1552887447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-18T10:59:28Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
