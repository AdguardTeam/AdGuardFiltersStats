However, I don't face any issues accessing https://pinterest.com/. I tried disabling the browser extension and even turned off protection from the AdGuard desktop app, but the page still wouldn't load. Strangely, the issue disappears only after I completely uninstall the AdGuard software, allowing me to access the website without any problems.\r\n> \r\n> Please note that this doesn't seem to be related to the browser extension itself. I tested it on Firefox, where the AdGuard extension isn't installed, and I still couldn't access the page.\r\n> \r\n> Could you kindly guide me on how to access https://analytics.pinterest.com/ without having to uninstall AdGuard?

ATTENTION\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.

рекламы в приложении ВК, мне ответили, что в приложении нет возможности скрыть рекламу, можно пользоваться ВК через браузер, там не будет рекламы. Зашла ВК  через браузер и что?-как была реклама ,так и осталась. Реклама не только в приложении ВК,но и в других приложениях смартфона. Во всех браузерах  реклама выскакивает, на любой странице.  За что я оплатила пожизненную лицензию?-не понимаю . В чем проблема?\r\nUsername: `@Татьяна `\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/9pl9elvu8lwco0kkc8cg0so8sso0o0ws6431k6z00g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ljt3r42pr74swcgwggowwso40g0k4wohbogfcjolnk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.6.5\r\nSystem version: | Android 15\r\nBrowser: | Яндекс Браузер\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Dr. Web light","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2614414236","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196476#issuecomment-2614414236","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/196476","id":2614414236,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86b1Muc","user":{"login":"ihurin","id":33690072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjkwMDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33690072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihurin","html_url":"https://github.com/ihurin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihurin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihurin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihurin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihurin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihurin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihurin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihurin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihurin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihurin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-26T13:13:49Z","updated_at":"2025-01-26T13:13:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Alex-302 проверили у себя, рекламы нет.
