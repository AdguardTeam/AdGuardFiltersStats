browser extension is enabled, I am unable to access https://analytics.pinterest.com/. However, I don't face any issues accessing https://pinterest.com/. I tried disabling the browser extension and even turned off protection from the AdGuard desktop app, but the page still wouldn't load. Strangely, the issue disappears only after I completely uninstall the AdGuard software, allowing me to access the website without any problems.\r\n> \r\n> Please note that this doesn't seem to be related to the browser extension itself. I tested it on Firefox, where the AdGuard extension isn't installed, and I still couldn't access the page.\r\n> \r\n> Could you kindly guide me on how to access https://analytics.pinterest.com/ without having to uninstall AdGuard?
