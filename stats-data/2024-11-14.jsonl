Comment\r\n> Steps to reproduce:\r\n> 1.Look at Wordpress admin dashboard panel, see Monster Insights having java loading issue\r\n> 2.Check both monsterinsights.com and the wordpress website are whitelisted in AdGuard\r\n> 3.Go to filters and toggle language filters off\r\n> 4. Hit F5 in admin panel and review MonsterInsights data! (took me a while to find this out!!!)\r\n> 5. Study language filter list, see they are all on down to Dandelions Nordic, off from Ukraine and below\r\n> 6. Wonder about this weird state of affairs, not even sure what the language filters are doing for me as only ever interested in English.\r\n> 7. Resign to leaving Language filters off and making a GitHub report, so whatever the irksome bug somewhere in that mess can be weeded out :)\r\n> 8. Get told this report needs to be attention Filters Team, so GitHub report gets closed so I can make it all over again, please don't do that, again!!!\r\nUsername: `@VinceS2`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/nmhwwr8s9mo4kkgo0osgw48w0cgc0oogy2c2qz8gs8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2pgsybu71wu88s4gcc0okog4owgc0cslaaik88yhxc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.0.165 MV3\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Quick Fixes<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters</details>\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192751/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2476047138","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192751#issuecomment-2476047138","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192751","id":2476047138,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86TlXsi","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-14T11:02:33Z","updated_at":"2024-11-14T11:02:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Unfortunately, I can't log in with `wordpress` account there.

We do not want to visit that site itself, but we want to continue through a few clicks on the \"Next\" option until we reach the final download link!!\r\n> \r\n> I will explain the problem in simple steps:\r\n> First, visit the following link:\r\n> https://linkjust.com/sqnBrlF\r\n> Here AdGuard is detected and we cannot continue with the links. If we hide this message that says that you have an ad blocker, the \"Next\" button will disappear with it (in rare cases, the button remains), but in general, hiding the message is a completely ineffective solution.\r\n> I hope that someone with a brain will be assigned to solve this problem, thank you.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n

Comment\r\n> In all the years of using ad blockers, I have never seen a response as stupid as BlazDT!!\r\n> You idiot, when you tell me that \"Not enough visitors\" means that you are not qualified to deal with the problem in the first place! Of course, there are not many visitors because it is a link shortening site. We do not want to visit that site itself, but we want to continue through a few clicks on the \"Next\" option until we reach the final download link!!\r\n> \r\n> I will explain the problem in simple steps:\r\n> First, visit the following link:\r\n> https://linkjust.com/sqnBrlF\r\n> Here AdGuard is detected and we cannot continue with the links. If we hide this message that says that you have an ad blocker, the \"Next\" button will disappear with it (in rare cases, the button remains), but in general, hiding the message is a completely ineffective solution.\r\n> I hope that someone with a brain will be assigned to solve this problem, thank you.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n

Comment\r\n> Steps to reproduce:\r\n> 1.Look at Wordpress admin dashboard panel, see Monster Insights having java loading issue\r\n> 2.Check both monsterinsights.com and the wordpress website are whitelisted in AdGuard\r\n> 3.Go to filters and toggle language filters off\r\n> 4. Hit F5 in admin panel and review MonsterInsights data! (took me a while to find this out!!!)\r\n> 5. Study language filter list, see they are all on down to Dandelions Nordic, off from Ukraine and below\r\n> 6. Wonder about this weird state of affairs, not even sure what the language filters are doing for me as only ever interested in English.\r\n> 7. Resign to leaving Language filters off and making a GitHub report, so whatever the irksome bug somewhere in that mess can be weeded out :)\r\n> 8. Get told this report needs to be attention Filters Team, so GitHub report gets closed so I can make it all over again, please don't do that, again!!!\r\nUsername: `@VinceS2`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/nmhwwr8s9mo4kkgo0osgw48w0cgc0oogy2c2qz8gs8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2pgsybu71wu88s4gcc0okog4owgc0cslaaik88yhxc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.0.165 MV3\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Quick Fixes<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters</details>\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192751/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-14T15:01:57Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

AdGuard Content Blocker\r\n\r\nBy the way @AdamWr, for **AdGuard Content Blocker** product support, would it be possible to bring back this original rule (before the editing then removing)?\r\n```adblock\r\n@@||v.fwmrm.net/ad/g/1$domain=m6.fr (*)\r\n```\r\n###### **(*)** Depending on how the **FreeWheel** component is configured, it could be `$script` or `$xmlhttprequest`. Can add both to the rule but better not to specify anything then, I would say.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nRule useful because if you simulate no JS/Scriptlet support (via `@@||m6.fr^$jsinject,important`) to be like this product, you will trigger the [AAB message](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/024cc83b-c2c6-4584-a1a4-80169dda8524) quite often (not always but just navigate from video to video and it'll trigger at some point).\r\n\r\n✅ **Fixed** using the above rule ([screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cc2e9f2-7561-43a3-821f-d89bf302ec32)) despite having ads of course for these users (no other choice, but at least the videos are accessible), while **not fixed** with only the HEAD request allowed ([screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7887efc2-9aed-442b-8807-04c97fd8a600)). For the latter, you can still add it too as a bonus to be sure / to be future-proof if you want using `@@||v.fwmrm.net/|$xmlhttprequest,domain=m6.fr` like @Yuki2718 did [originally](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/commit/2630bfe7eeefa7004fd32080314bd38052c5c9a9) but doesn't seem required according to my tests.

iCloud Private Relay, disabled website protection for this domain, and tried to pause the Adguard desktop app, but it still caused a delay and even failed to open the page. The only way to load this page correctly is to remove Safari Extension.
