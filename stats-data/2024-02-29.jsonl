I tried disabling all the relevant filters, like for pop-ups but still couldn't middle-click any pornhub links on google. I didn't know how to make user rules for this specific problem, so that might still be possible somehow. Nobody wants to have ads on pornhub obviously, so they can't just disable it for pornhub entirely. I also tried disabling it on google itself by the way, but that did not have any effect, still wouldn't open.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pw8qt6yc9pcgs8ok8sc4kksc0sksogko76p56al64g.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mmdr408v4cgwcw8g884s0wc4gc44cw0d7y7sm8pr94.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.13\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 Pro, versie 22H2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>List-KR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/173050/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-29T16:27:49Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
