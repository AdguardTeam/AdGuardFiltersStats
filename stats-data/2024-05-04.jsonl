Alex,\r\n\r\nYes you are right, this site looks like trash because it's designed for\r\nonly one purpose. To purposefully make you surf through ads & in return\r\nfinally provide you with the actual link of the file that you want to\r\ndownload at the very end. They are called url shorteners (which actually\r\ngenerate money for the subscriber like say 5$ for 1000 clicks) & people who\r\nwant to earn free money make use of such shitty tactics.\r\n\r\nNow the most promising solution is to use url bypasser which usually most\r\npeople don't have access to (either they are not aware about it or its paid\r\nhence they can't use it) & hence they rely on Adguard to atleast not let\r\nthe ads load but must wait for the countdown (ranges from 20-60 secs) on\r\neach ad filled page to reach Zero & finally arrive at the actual link of\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nFew months ago I had actually requested this Url Bypasser feature to be\r\nadded in Adguard but it seems no one is bothered about it.\r\n\r\nIf Adguard ingrains this feature in the app itself then all those ad filled\r\npages would be bypassed & we would directly arrive at the actual link.\r\n\r\nRegarding the source of such url shorteners link, people on telegram &\r\nmaybe other messenger apps are doing it (& also encouraging other file\r\nproviders to use it).\r\n\r\nHope maybe you can understand the actual need of a url bypasser & maybe\r\nenlighten your team/higher ups to incorporate this feature in Adguard app\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThank you once again Alex for responding.\r\n\r\nOn Fri, 3 May, 2024, 17:27 Alex, ***@***.***> wrote:\r\n\r\n> @ChimpuFernandez <https://github.com/ChimpuFernandez> Please post\r\n> screenshots and links of all redirections.
