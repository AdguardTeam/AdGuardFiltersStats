Alex,\r\n\r\nYes you are right, this site looks like trash because it's designed for\r\nonly one purpose. To purposefully make you surf through ads & in return\r\nfinally provide you with the actual link of the file that you want to\r\ndownload at the very end. They are called url shorteners (which actually\r\ngenerate money for the subscriber like say 5$ for 1000 clicks) & people who\r\nwant to earn free money make use of such shitty tactics.\r\n\r\nNow the most promising solution is to use url bypasser which usually most\r\npeople don't have access to (either they are not aware about it or its paid\r\nhence they can't use it) & hence they rely on Adguard to atleast not let\r\nthe ads load but must wait for the countdown (ranges from 20-60 secs) on\r\neach ad filled page to reach Zero & finally arrive at the actual link of\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nFew months ago I had actually requested this Url Bypasser feature to be\r\nadded in Adguard but it seems no one is bothered about it.\r\n\r\nIf Adguard ingrains this feature in the app itself then all those ad filled\r\npages would be bypassed & we would directly arrive at the actual link.\r\n\r\nRegarding the source of such url shorteners link, people on telegram &\r\nmaybe other messenger apps are doing it (& also encouraging other file\r\nproviders to use it).\r\n\r\nHope maybe you can understand the actual need of a url bypasser & maybe\r\nenlighten your team/higher ups to incorporate this feature in Adguard app\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThank you once again Alex for responding.\r\n\r\nOn Fri, 3 May, 2024, 17:27 Alex, ***@***.***> wrote:\r\n\r\n> @ChimpuFernandez <https://github.com/ChimpuFernandez> Please post\r\n> screenshots and links of all redirections.

This PR blocks it.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### To avoid invalid pull requests, please check and confirm following terms\r\n\r\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report;\r\n- [x] My code follows the [guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [x] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [ ] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\n\r\nThis script from Qidian consumes user's CPU and appears to provide no actual functionality. This slows down the user's browser. I suspect that this script is either a mining script or an anti-ad blocker measure.\r\n\r\n### Enter the issue address\r\n\r\n[#178228](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178228)\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\n#### If possible, a screenshot of a page or application should not be cropped too much. Otherwise, it is not always clear where the element is located\r\n\r\nThis can be confirmed both on Firefox and Chromium. Blocking this script does not affect website functionality. I tested the basic login and reading (this is a novel website) functions, and everything seems to be working fine.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Screenshot 1:</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/29907700/c8efc467-80e1-4f8a-9810-e100f9975b72)\r\n\r\nThe script is obfuscated and makes a large number of recursive function calls. This can be confirmed using the browser's performance profiler.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not

This PR blocks it.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### To avoid invalid pull requests, please check and confirm following terms\r\n\r\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report;\r\n- [x] My code follows the [guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [x] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [ ] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\n\r\nThis script from Qidian consumes user's CPU and appears to provide no actual functionality. This slows down the user's browser. I suspect that this script is either a mining script or an anti-ad blocker measure.\r\n\r\n### Enter the issue address\r\n\r\n[#178228](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178228)\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\n#### If possible, a screenshot of a page or application should not be cropped too much. Otherwise, it is not always clear where the element is located\r\n\r\nThis can be confirmed both on Firefox and Chromium. Blocking this script does not affect website functionality. I tested the basic login and reading (this is a novel website) functions, and everything seems to be working fine.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Screenshot 1:</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/29907700/c8efc467-80e1-4f8a-9810-e100f9975b72)\r\n\r\nThe script is obfuscated and makes a large number of recursive function calls. This can be confirmed using the browser's performance profiler.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not
