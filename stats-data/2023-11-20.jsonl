Upon investigation, I noticed that it was because the filter was blocking adguard-dns.io and adguard-dns.com which presumably rendered Adguard's DNS useless.  I manually unblocked those two domains only to find out later that it was not blocking adguard-vpn.com as well, thus rendering Adguard VPN useless? I want to use the filter to prevent methods to bypass my personal Adguard DNS and VPN but not to block them as well.  It seems counterproductive to use this filter in Adguard only to block itself.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/5qaimjtm1o8wgw484coo4s40c0o4skg47s9kpfp90k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hijc6ln6834s8o0wgs00ss48kc8skcsfdtlwy1rf5s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pjjmpu68uu8g8kkwwkscg048woc08c8spykm7dcvrk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/oft1huil9ios8sgsoo4kkgk8o48s4807z561d5gyuc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.12.2.1415 release\r\nSystem version: | macOS 14.1.1\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (Default behavior), <br>Hide your User-Agent (Default behavior), <br>Hide your IP address (Default behavior (208.54.104.184)), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (0), <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (600), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard`, `Personal`, `DNS`, `https://d.adguard-dns.com/dns-query/371a2c36`<br>filters: `1hosts_lite`, ` adguard_dns_filter`, ` adway_default_blocklist`, ` curben_phishing_filter`, ` dan_pollocks_list`, ` dandelion_sprouts_anti_malware_list`, ` dandelion_sprouts_anti_push_notifications`, ` dandelion_sprouts_game_console_adblock_list`, ` hagezi_allowlist_referral`, ` hagezi_antipiracy_blocklist`, ` hagezi_encrypted_dns_vpn_tor_proxy_bypass`, ` hagezi_gambling_blocklist`, ` hagezi_pro`, ` hagezi_threat_intelligence_feeds`, ` nocoin_filter_list`, ` oisd_basic`, ` perflyst_dandelion_sprout_smart_tv_blocklist_for_adguard_home`, ` peter_lowe_list`, ` phishing_army`, ` scam_blocklist_by_durablenapkin`, ` shadowwhisperers_malware_list`, ` staklerware_indicators_list`, ` steven_blacks_list`, ` the_big_list_of_hacked_malware_web_sites`, ` ublock_badware_risks`, ` urlhaus_filter_online`, ` windowsspyblocker_hosts_spy_rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | AdGuard app and extensions, AdGuard VPN, AdGuard Extra, and AdGuard DNS","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/166659/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-20T07:26:10Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
