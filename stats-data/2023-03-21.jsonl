The link to the promotion number and the discounted list does not work with adguard installed on my machines (MAC and PC). I have Chrome, Firefox, and Brave.  That particular URL is blocked for all of them.  I am using https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query in my router DNS setting.  Disabling adguard in the browsers does not work, maybe because it's the router DNS?

I don't even know if I am using some of the settings or not, so I could not really answer the questions.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/X9bzzF4.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/yimObJ0.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/54ilnKm.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11.3\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://unfiltered.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.freshdirect.com/login/login.jsp?successPage=/your_account/chef_table.jsp](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freshdirect.com%2Flogin%2Flogin.jsp%3FsuccessPage%3D%2Fyour_account%2Fchef_table.jsp)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145214/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1477984521","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145214#issuecomment-1477984521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145214","id":1477984521,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85YGEEJ","user":{"login":"Sergey-Lyapin","id":18536328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM2MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18536328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin","html_url":"https://github.com/Sergey-Lyapin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sergey-Lyapin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-21T14:53:37Z","updated_at":"2023-03-21T14:53:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello @quaybj\r\n\r\nI don't see this banner, could you tell me how to find it?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1477984521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-21T14:53:37Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @misc-activities\r\n> In the Walmart login page (see 0.png), I entered my email address and clicked on the Continue button. It opened a message box trying to show me a \"Press and Hold\" type CAPTCHA but the CAPTCHA didn't load. This can be seen in 1.png. So, I clicked on \"Try a different method\" in the message box. When I did that, it showed me a picture identification type CAPTCHA (see 2.png). When I completed the CAPTCHA verification, instead of asking me for the password, it went back to the page where it was asking for my email address and showed a message saying, \"Something went wrong, please try again.\" This can be seen in 3.png.\r\n> \r\n> I closed the AdGuard app and tried and I was able to login successfully.

However, a new version of GoatRAT functions as a Banking Trojan, specifically aimed at Brazilian banks.\r\n\r\nLike other types of Banking Trojans, GoatRAT utilizes the Accessibility service to implement an Automatic Transfer System (ATS) framework, which enables the transfer of money from the victim’s account using the PIX key. The PIX key is used to perform the instant payment. This malware currently targets three Brazilian banks: NUBank, Banco Inter, and PagBank.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40774281/226697704-8d3874d2-43e6-4dbb-a8bb-5796352dccbf.png)\r\n\r\nURL font: https://blog.cyble.com/2023/03/14/goatrat-android-banking-trojan-variant-targeting-brazilian-banks/\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nBlock URL's:\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n<!--StartFragment-->\r\n\r\nURL | Description\r\n-- | -- \r\nhxxps://bit[.]ly/nubankmodulo | Shortened malware distribution URL\r\nhxxps://goatrat[.]com/apks/apk20.apk | Malware distribution URL\r\nhxxp://api.goatrat[.]com:3008 | C&C server to receive PIX key\r\n\r\n<!--EndFragment-->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-21T17:52:13Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

When I did that, it showed me a picture identification type CAPTCHA (see 2.png). When I completed the CAPTCHA verification, instead of asking me for the password, it went back to the page where it was asking for my email address and showed a message saying, \"Something went wrong, please try again.\" This can be seen in 3.png.\r\n> \r\n> I closed the AdGuard app and tried and I was able to login successfully.
