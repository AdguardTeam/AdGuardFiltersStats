Adguard family dns has not blocked this site. Please block it. reproduction is simple as visiting the site. By the way, I need some advice. Should this be blocked or not? Out of the 20 or so videos featured in the feed, there are usually about 3 that are NSFW content. Not all of them. This is not a typical adult site. There are more normal videos that are fine. Adguard family dns may not need to block this site. No, there are a few, but they are there. guard family dns should block them. If children see them, they will be hurt. what do you think? I want it blocked.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/a3ganhnr72wckcog8scs4wk44gs8scs3yfor435yde.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/60nejzpz5i4g4gs8kgoogsgkks4s04oepz88oswjc0.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/db1tfu0bes080k0c08owc8g0owossk03pbsxbxukpc.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/g65baikn0ygcc8wko8o4kc88k8kkcct7cvtljiq74g.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/lthk4l3075sw8gs0gg800s0gco8csgcgee2xuxh6wo.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/jg0muzvts9kckoowo0scwokgw4ggc0kqzae3bvbecg.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.3\r\nSystem version: | `Windows11, version 24H2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | TDI\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS Family Protection server`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=AdGuard+DNS+Family+Protection+server)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3139904754","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473#issuecomment-3139904754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473","id":3139904754,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM867JyTy","user":{"login":"vlzs","id":86694578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2Njk0NTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86694578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs","html_url":"https://github.com/vlzs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-31T13:05:15Z","updated_at":"2025-07-31T13:05:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I made a typo.\nNot \"guard\" \n\"Adguard\" is correct.\n\nIt seems like a lot of work to add all reported sites to the block list.

Adguard family dns has not blocked this site. Please block it. reproduction is simple as visiting the site. By the way, I need some advice. Should this be blocked or not? Out of the 20 or so videos featured in the feed, there are usually about 3 that are NSFW content. Not all of them. This is not a typical adult site. There are more normal videos that are fine. Adguard family dns may not need to block this site. No, there are a few, but they are there. guard family dns should block them. If children see them, they will be hurt. what do you think? I want it blocked.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/a3ganhnr72wckcog8scs4wk44gs8scs3yfor435yde.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/60nejzpz5i4g4gs8kgoogsgkks4s04oepz88oswjc0.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/db1tfu0bes080k0c08owc8g0owossk03pbsxbxukpc.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/g65baikn0ygcc8wko8o4kc88k8kkcct7cvtljiq74g.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/lthk4l3075sw8gs0gg800s0gco8csgcgee2xuxh6wo.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/jg0muzvts9kckoowo0scwokgw4ggc0kqzae3bvbecg.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.3\r\nSystem version: | `Windows11, version 24H2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | TDI\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS Family Protection server`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=AdGuard+DNS+Family+Protection+server)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-31T12:55:22Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript.
