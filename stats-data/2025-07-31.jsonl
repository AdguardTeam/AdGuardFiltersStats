Adguard family dns has not blocked this site. Please block it. reproduction is simple as visiting the site. By the way, I need some advice. Should this be blocked or not? Out of the 20 or so videos featured in the feed, there are usually about 3 that are NSFW content. Not all of them. This is not a typical adult site. There are more normal videos that are fine. Adguard family dns may not need to block this site. No, there are a few, but they are there. guard family dns should block them. If children see them, they will be hurt. what do you think? I want it blocked.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/a3ganhnr72wckcog8scs4wk44gs8scs3yfor435yde.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/60nejzpz5i4g4gs8kgoogsgkks4s04oepz88oswjc0.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/db1tfu0bes080k0c08owc8g0owossk03pbsxbxukpc.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/g65baikn0ygcc8wko8o4kc88k8kkcct7cvtljiq74g.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/lthk4l3075sw8gs0gg800s0gco8csgcgee2xuxh6wo.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/jg0muzvts9kckoowo0scwokgw4ggc0kqzae3bvbecg.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.3\r\nSystem version: | `Windows11, version 24H2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | TDI\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS Family Protection server`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=AdGuard+DNS+Family+Protection+server)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3139904754","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473#issuecomment-3139904754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473","id":3139904754,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM867JyTy","user":{"login":"vlzs","id":86694578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2Njk0NTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86694578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs","html_url":"https://github.com/vlzs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlzs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-31T13:05:15Z","updated_at":"2025-07-31T13:05:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I made a typo.\nNot \"guard\" \n\"Adguard\" is correct.\n\nIt seems like a lot of work to add all reported sites to the block list.

Adguard family dns has not blocked this site. Please block it. reproduction is simple as visiting the site. By the way, I need some advice. Should this be blocked or not? Out of the 20 or so videos featured in the feed, there are usually about 3 that are NSFW content. Not all of them. This is not a typical adult site. There are more normal videos that are fine. Adguard family dns may not need to block this site. No, there are a few, but they are there. guard family dns should block them. If children see them, they will be hurt. what do you think? I want it blocked.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/a3ganhnr72wckcog8scs4wk44gs8scs3yfor435yde.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/60nejzpz5i4g4gs8kgoogsgkks4s04oepz88oswjc0.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/db1tfu0bes080k0c08owc8g0owossk03pbsxbxukpc.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/g65baikn0ygcc8wko8o4kc88k8kkcct7cvtljiq74g.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/lthk4l3075sw8gs0gg800s0gco8csgcgee2xuxh6wo.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/jg0muzvts9kckoowo0scwokgw4ggc0kqzae3bvbecg.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.3\r\nSystem version: | `Windows11, version 24H2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | TDI\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS Family Protection server`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=AdGuard+DNS+Family+Protection+server)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-31T12:55:22Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.

Most of the websites I visit (Celebrity Cruiseline, the Kitchn, other similar websites) the pictures are missing. Some are just blank and others have a question mark in the little box in the middle.  On Facebook a box pops up saying there is a problem to try again later and I can get rid of that by refreshing the page.  I paid for this version of AdGuard. The free version didn't cause these issues. How do I get a refund and go back to the free version?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/fj9qwd8mxs004wsg4kccko0cw8800wko7c129xjnj4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/qt5agvknka8skgo4kg0wo08kcc0cc84464295hbl9k.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.22\r\nSystem version: | `macOS 15.6`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nOther extensions used: | `Nothing else.

content. Adguard family dns has not blocked this site. Please block it. reproduction is simple as visiting the site. By the way, I need some advice. Should this be blocked or not? Out of the 20 or so videos featured in the feed, there are usually about 3 that are NSFW content. Not all of them. This is not a typical adult site. There are more normal videos that are fine. Adguard family dns may not need to block this site. No, there are a few, but they are there. guard family dns should block them. If children see them, they will be hurt. what do you think? I want it blocked.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/a3ganhnr72wckcog8scs4wk44gs8scs3yfor435yde.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/60nejzpz5i4g4gs8kgoogsgkks4s04oepz88oswjc0.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/db1tfu0bes080k0c08owc8g0owossk03pbsxbxukpc.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/g65baikn0ygcc8wko8o4kc88k8kkcct7cvtljiq74g.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/lthk4l3075sw8gs0gg800s0gco8csgcgee2xuxh6wo.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/jg0muzvts9kckoowo0scwokgw4ggc0kqzae3bvbecg.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.3\r\nSystem version: | `Windows11, version 24H2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | TDI\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS Family Protection server`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=AdGuard+DNS+Family+Protection+server)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-31T14:45:38Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

content. Adguard family dns has not blocked this site. Please block it. reproduction is simple as visiting the site. By the way, I need some advice. Should this be blocked or not? Out of the 20 or so videos featured in the feed, there are usually about 3 that are NSFW content. Not all of them. This is not a typical adult site. There are more normal videos that are fine. Adguard family dns may not need to block this site. No, there are a few, but they are there. guard family dns should block them. If children see them, they will be hurt. what do you think? I want it blocked.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/a3ganhnr72wckcog8scs4wk44gs8scs3yfor435yde.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/60nejzpz5i4g4gs8kgoogsgkks4s04oepz88oswjc0.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/db1tfu0bes080k0c08owc8g0owossk03pbsxbxukpc.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/g65baikn0ygcc8wko8o4kc88k8kkcct7cvtljiq74g.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/lthk4l3075sw8gs0gg800s0gco8csgcgee2xuxh6wo.png?nc=1)\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/jg0muzvts9kckoowo0scwokgw4ggc0kqzae3bvbecg.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.3\r\nSystem version: | `Windows11, version 24H2`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | TDI\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS Family Protection server`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=AdGuard+DNS+Family+Protection+server)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3140263285","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473#issuecomment-3140263285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/210473","id":3140263285,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM867LJ11","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-31T14:45:36Z","updated_at":"2025-07-31T14:45:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi!

Comment\r\n> This isn't the only website. Most of the websites I visit (Celebrity Cruiseline, the Kitchn, other similar websites) the pictures are missing. Some are just blank and others have a question mark in the little box in the middle.  On Facebook a box pops up saying there is a problem to try again later and I can get rid of that by refreshing the page.  I paid for this version of AdGuard.

Most of the websites I visit (Celebrity Cruiseline, the Kitchn, other similar websites) the pictures are missing. Some are just blank and others have a question mark in the little box in the middle.  On Facebook a box pops up saying there is a problem to try again later and I can get rid of that by refreshing the page.  I paid for this version of AdGuard.

It's only fortune the rule currently doesn't have FP. The only meaningful selector `.bg-gray-200` just specifies a background color and `##.bg-gray-200` has FPs, which happened to be cancelled by the other two almost meaningless classes. `.justify-center` has 54 matches and `.flex` 224, both of them are too generic. I'd go with `##.min-h-\\[100px\\].min-w-\\[320px\\]` as it's the best selector here and ignore 20px placeholder, but if you can't bear not to choose the top node, why don't use much more meaningful `.py-\\[10px\\]` that specifies padding-top/-bottom 10px, somewhat characteristic to such a box element and in fact only has 3 matches. It's still not safe enough and will better to be more specified, e.g. `##.xl\\:block + div.bg-gray-200.py-\\[10px\\]`.\r\ncc: @Alex-302 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/comments/163227943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-07-31T17:11:53Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

The owner of this video doesn't allow AdBlocker. Please disable your AdBlocker, Thank you.\"*\r\n> \r\n> If this overlay is manually blocked, the player shows a second overlay:\r\n> > *\"Video keep loading? Select a different server or refresh the page.\"*\r\n> \r\n> From my observation, once adblock usage is detected, the **actual video player** is never loaded at all. Instead, it is replaced entirely with one of these two overlays. This means the real video stream never initiates when adblock is detected.\r\n> \r\n> ---\r\n> \r\n> ## Steps to Reproduce\r\n> 1.
