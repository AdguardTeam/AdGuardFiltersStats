If supported only unencrypted DNS - use 94.140.14.140.\r\n\r\nThe private DNS settings only allow for a hostname, the IP address doesn't work. \r\n\r\nAs far as VPN when I go to add a new VPN it has all these options that I'm not sure what to do with. \r\n[Screenshot_20241119-193627](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a031dcb-bf90-4512-99a5-025cb664d270)\r\n\r\nOr do you mean the Adguard VPN app? I installed it to test but it looks like it requires an account to use and I don't want to create an account just to use the public DNS servers. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2487052995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-20T00:39:13Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
