Comment\r\n> User rules/allow list doesn’t seem to work\r\n> Steps to replicate:\r\n> 1: enter any website\r\n> 2: disable AdGuard and reload the page if it doesn’t do so automatically\r\n> 3: observe how the website looks no different\r\n> \r\n> The only way to actually disable AdGuard, whether it’s supposed to be disabled on that website or not, is to select “Turn Off Content Blockers” in the other menu.\r\n> The same issue is present on an iPhone running iOS of the same version.\r\n```\r\nUsername: @Luigi2262\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1

how the website looks no different\r\n> \r\n> The only way to actually disable AdGuard, whether it’s supposed to be disabled on that website or not, is to select “Turn Off Content Blockers” in the
