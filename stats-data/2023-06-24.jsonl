https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/154561#issue-1772482431\r\n> \r\n> @Yuki2718\r\n> \r\n> コメントありがとうございます。\r\n> 倫理上の問題があり対応が難しいというのは理解しました。\r\n> お忙しい中何度も失礼して申し訳ございませんが、なぜ今回メンションをしたか説明させてください。\r\n> \r\n> 私は過去に複数回、ろくな再現努力もされずに(すなわち、再現できない場合他の人に確認を求めるといった対応がなされずに)提示したIssueをcloseされた経験があります。\r\n> バグ報告の際、報告者は不具合の内容を文章で説明したり、個人情報が含まれないようスクリーンショットを撮ったり、そのスクリーンショットに必要に応じてハイライトしたり、多くの時間と労力を費やしています。\r\n> それにも関わらずそういった杜撰な対応をされると、利用者としては頭にくるのです。\r\n> 結局それらIssueは、対応された方が私と諸々の条件(デバイスの種類、フィルター、ステルスモードオプション等)を合わせていなかったために再現できなかったということがのちに判明しています(別の人に対応していただいたところすんなり解決したことも多いです)。\r\n> であれば、そういったミスマッチを防ぐため、過去に類似のIssueを担当された方を見つけた場合その方に声をかけるというのは、利用者と技術者のどちらにとっても大きな利益のあることかと思います。\r\n> AdGuard公式も、過去に似た問題が提出されていないかチェックすることを推奨しています:\r\n> \r\n> https://adguard.com/kb/ja/guides/report-bugs/\r\n> \r\n> 以上のような理由から、利用者が特定の技術者に声をかけることなく安心してIssueを投稿できるようになるには、\r\n> 1. 利用者と各種の条件を合わせられる人がIssueを担当する\r\n> 2. もし再現できなかった場合、別の人(最低でも一人)に確認を求める\r\n> といったことが徹底される必要があると考えています。\r\n> \r\n> 公式も、例えば以下のページの「最後に」で「GitHubでご意見、機能提案やバグ報告をを大歓迎しております(原文ママ)」と謳っているわけですから、\r\n> AdGuard社員の技術者の方々はもちろん、そうでない協力者の方々にもそこは是非対応してほしいという気持ちです。\r\n> \r\n> https://adguard.com/ja/blog/adguard-v4-0-for-android-old-vs-new.html\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> なおこのIssueはcloseしていただいて構いません。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n
