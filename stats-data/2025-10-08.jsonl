again.\n\n<details>\nChecking the dashboard, the blocked service is \"app-measurement.com\"\nHowever, it is a generic service, which I believe the Google Phone app tries to access to query spam lists. I don't think I'm the only person who, since installing the AdGuard DNS filter, no longer has spam calls filtered, but I haven't found anything about it online.\n</details>\n\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/215104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/215104/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3380755886","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/215104#issuecomment-3380755886","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/215104","id":3380755886,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87Jgj2u","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-08T10:00:14Z","updated_at":"2025-10-08T10:00:14Z","body":"Most likely, AdGuard does not affect this feature.

ticket was closed before and other issues were checked (we could not reproduce them or issue is just not fixable, like in case of YouTube app for iOS/Android).\n\n>Personally, I'm on Safari - MacOS (Incase you don't know, that is a Desktop based OS, and using a Browser) and the Ads are not being blocked. Especially after the MacBook is awaken from sleep/hibernation. You have to close out Safari entirely, then relaunch for AdGuard to start working again, (not just on Youtube, but on all sites)\n\nThat does not sound like a filter lists issue when it happens on all websites and ads are blocked after restarting browser.\nIf you are using Safari extension and ads are blocked after restarting Safari, please report your issue here - https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardForSafari/issues\nIn case of AdGuard for MacOS here - https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForMac/issues\n\nYou can also try AdGuard Mini beta - https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-mini-for-mac-beta-is-out.html, perhaps it has been fixed already.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3381052772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-10-08T11:19:25Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
