When I disable adguard and make CTRL+F5 or refresh some times the page, I see cookies notification, I choose min. necessary cookie options and then the site works and reacts on my clicks. I did not use user rules here and there are no filter-updates available in this time. Operas blocker was always on, antivirus is not checking my browser and we can ignore that. When I turn adguard on, all works. Check and fix please, I need this website and want always let Adguard on. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/o1p5qvtbou80wk0ko0ggkwo0wk04408eammn92aajc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bii1yntc5h4wwok8o4k0o8owo8c80gcndrexmtgj0g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.14\r\nSystem version: | Linux x86_64\r\nBrowser: | Opera\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Germany, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>IndianList</details>\r\nOther extensions used: | clamTk antivirus in Linux, Opera browsers standard add blocker","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174865/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-14T00:24:03Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

But those ads are blocked by AdGuard.\r\n\r\n_note: this link shortener site seems to save your IP address to grant you access for 24h to the downloads, once you complete the steps. This access permission is independent for each of the movie websites._\r\n\r\nthe link shortener uses these auxiliary domains: \r\n`todoandroid.live|gadgetzona.net|freeserverhostingweb.club|qwanturankpro.com|notipostingt.com`\r\n`todoandroid.live,gadgetzona.net,freeserverhostingweb.club,qwanturankpro.com,notipostingt.com`\r\nIt is in these domains where the ads should show up, so we can click them.

seems to be that this link shortener site forces you to click on some ads to move forward. But those ads are blocked by AdGuard.\r\n\r\n_note: this link shortener site seems to save your IP address to grant you access for 24h to the downloads, once you complete the steps. This access permission is independent for each of the movie websites._\r\n\r\nthe link shortener uses these auxiliary domains: \r\n`todoandroid.live|gadgetzona.net|freeserverhostingweb.club|qwanturankpro.com|notipostingt.com`\r\n`todoandroid.live,gadgetzona.net,freeserverhostingweb.club,qwanturankpro.com,notipostingt.com`\r\nIt is in these domains where the ads should show up, so we can click them. But they are blocked, so I can't move forward through the link shortener.\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1996797765","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174863#issuecomment-1996797765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/174863","id":1996797765,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM853BLdF","user":{"login":"Rust1667","id":115593284,"node_id":"U_kgDOBuPQRA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115593284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rust1667","html_url":"https://github.com/Rust1667","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rust1667/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rust1667/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rust1667/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rust1667/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rust1667/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rust1667/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rust1667/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rust1667/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rust1667/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-14T08:13:45Z","updated_at":"2024-03-14T08:13:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Both rules are working perfectly, thank you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1996797765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-14T08:13:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
