I just disabled userscript extension in settings, cleared history from last hour, restarted safari, disabled all safari filters in adguard except Base and Mobile Ads, and thephoblographer (another site with similar problem) did not show me any ads but slashdot still has this problem.\r\nNot restarting or not clearing history - same result.\r\n\r\nBoth sites use html-loader.com, content-loader.com, report-error.com (from facebook?) as means to display ads - I block them on firewall level.\r\n\r\nSo whatever filters or extensions I enable or disable they are ignored somehow and this is not the first time. I think I solved this \"refresh\" issue in past by restarting a device. This issue is present for more than a year... it survived at least 4 iOS upgrades.\r\n\r\nSo I think that your problems with reproducing the issue may be related to this \"refresh\" problem. Somehow safari cached content blockers or something else.\r\n\r\nOf course I can't reproduce the issue on MacOS with safari even when set to \"iPad mini\". Only the site looks the same way as it should on safari on iPad mini (or android firefox). I don't see in developer tools on MacOS any attempts to make request to \"ads domains\" - i.e. no html-loader.com\r\n\r\nAs to microShiled and tinyShield - I tried first one, then second one, then both, and then neither - same result.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2511318929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-12-02T11:47:55Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
