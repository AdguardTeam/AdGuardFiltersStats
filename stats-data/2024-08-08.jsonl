Comment\r\n> Adguard полностью не работает на странице поиска яндекса. Не работают даже пользовательские правила, не связанные с рекламой - вообще никакие.

Adguard не совершает никакую блокировку\r\nUsername: `@ISkIN-AI`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Comment\r\n> Adguard полностью не работает на странице поиска яндекса. Не работают даже пользовательские правила, не связанные с рекламой - вообще никакие. Для теста попробовал заблокировать элемент по (статическому) классу - при предпросмотре он исчезает, но после после перезагрузки элемент с таким же классом снова появляется, т.е. Adguard не совершает никакую блокировку\r\nUsername: `@ISkIN-AI`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2iiop83dpw6c0s488c8so00o8c8wwkkra0pxjxhwuo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hmtawcaab688ckkwwksoko00ggwsww4ncv6c4negy8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.18.1 (4778)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.19045.0\r\nBrowser: | Яндекс Браузер\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | TDI\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block trackers, <br>Disable WAP Push Message Routing Service, <br>Disable Windows Defender automatic samples submission, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://greasyfork.org/scripts/386590-jps-random-torrent-button/code/JPS Random Torrent Button.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\n\r\n### Import issue configuration (AdGuard for Windows)\r\n[Import](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=adguard%3Aimport_user_configuration%3Fbrowsing_security.enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.custom_bootstrap%3D%26dns.custom_fallback%3D%26dns.enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.fallback_mode%3DSystem%26dns.filters%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ffilters.adtidy.org%252Fwindows%252Ffilters%252F15.txt%252CUser%2Brules%26dns.filters_enabled%3Dtrue%26dns.servers%3Dquic%253A%252F%252Fdns.adguard-dns.com%26dns.timeout%3D0%26filters%3D111.216.238.1.2.3.5.6.7%26license_type%3Dpaid%26parental_control.enabled%3Dfalse%26product_type%3DWin%26product_version%3D7.18.1%2B%25284778%2529%26referrer%3D%26stealth.DNT%3Dtrue%26stealth.block_third_party_auth%3Dfalse%26stealth.block_trackers%3Dtrue%26stealth.disable_third_party_cache%3Dfalse%26stealth.disable_wap_push_message_routing_service%3Dtrue%26stealth.disable_windows_defender%3Dtrue%26stealth.disable_windows_telemetry%3Dtrue%26stealth.dpi%3Dtrue%26stealth.enabled%3Dtrue%26stealth.flash%3Dtrue%26stealth.hide_search_queries%3Dtrue%26stealth.java%3Dfalse%26stealth.location%3Dtrue%26stealth.push%3Dtrue%26stealth.strip_url%3Dfalse%26stealth.third_party_cookies%3D180%26stealth.turn_off_advertising_id%3Dtrue%26stealth.webrtc%3Dtrue%26stealth.x_client%3Dtrue%26system_version%3DMicrosoft%2BWindows%2BNT%2B10.0.19045.0%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fyandex.ru%252Fsearch%252F%253Ftext%253Dpython%252Bpathlib%252Bunlink%2526clid%253D2372572%2526banerid%253D6301000000%25253A5f08fc7f0496650022daad73%2526win%253D445%2526from%253Dntp%2526lr%253D13%26user_agent%3DMozilla%252F5.0%2B%2528Windows%2BNT%2B10.0%253B%2BWin64%253B%2Bx64%2529%2BAppleWebKit%252F537.36%2B%2528KHTML%252C%2Blike%2BGecko%2529%2BChrome%252F126.0.0.0%2BYaBrowser%252F24.7.0.0%2BSafari%252F537.36%26userscripts%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgreasyfork.org%252Fscripts%252F386590-jps-random-torrent-button%252Fcode%252FJPS%252520Random%252520Torrent%252520Button.user.js%252Chttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fadguard-extra%252F1.0%252Fadguard-extra.user.js%252Chttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fpopup-blocker%252F2.5%252Fpopupblocker.user.js%26utm_campaign%3Dreport%26utm_medium%3Dassistant%26utm_source%3Dwin%26win.wfp%3Dfalse)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185797/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-08T08:18:14Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Adguard полностью не работает на странице поиска яндекса. Не работают даже пользовательские правила, не связанные с рекламой - вообще никакие.

Adguard не совершает никакую блокировку\r\nUsername: `@ISkIN-AI`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Comment\r\n> Adguard полностью не работает на странице поиска яндекса. Не работают даже пользовательские правила, не связанные с рекламой - вообще никакие.

Adguard не совершает никакую блокировку\r\nUsername: `@ISkIN-AI`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Comment\r\n> Adguard полностью не работает на странице поиска яндекса. Не работают даже пользовательские правила, не связанные с рекламой - вообще никакие. Для теста попробовал заблокировать элемент по (статическому) классу - при предпросмотре он исчезает, но после после перезагрузки элемент с таким же классом снова появляется, т.е. Adguard не совершает никакую блокировку\r\nUsername: `@ISkIN-AI`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

ATTENTION\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.

Добрый день. AdGuard для iOS работает только в браузере Safari. В других приложениях AdGuard блокирует рекламу с помощью функции DNS (блокируя DNS-запросы). К сожалению, для многих сайтов этого недостаточно — помимо блокировки запросов, нужны правила, взаимодействующие с контентом страницы, чтобы полностью заблокировать рекламу. Так как в Telegram используется встроенный браузер, применить эти правила на данный момент невозможно.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2275846259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-08T13:33:05Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
