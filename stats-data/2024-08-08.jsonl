Comment\r\n> Adguard полностью не работает на странице поиска яндекса. Не работают даже пользовательские правила, не связанные с рекламой - вообще никакие.

Adguard не совершает никакую блокировку\r\nUsername: `@ISkIN-AI`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Comment\r\n> Adguard полностью не работает на странице поиска яндекса. Не работают даже пользовательские правила, не связанные с рекламой - вообще никакие. Для теста попробовал заблокировать элемент по (статическому) классу - при предпросмотре он исчезает, но после после перезагрузки элемент с таким же классом снова появляется, т.е. Adguard не совершает никакую блокировку\r\nUsername: `@ISkIN-AI`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2iiop83dpw6c0s488c8so00o8c8wwkkra0pxjxhwuo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hmtawcaab688ckkwwksoko00ggwsww4ncv6c4negy8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.18.1 (4778)\r\nSystem version: | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.19045.0\r\nBrowser: | Яндекс Браузер\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | TDI\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block trackers, <br>Disable WAP Push Message Routing Service, <br>Disable Windows Defender automatic samples submission, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://greasyfork.org/scripts/386590-jps-random-torrent-button/code/JPS Random Torrent Button.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\n\r\n### Import issue configuration (AdGuard for Windows)\r\n[Import](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=adguard%3Aimport_user_configuration%3Fbrowsing_security.enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.custom_bootstrap%3D%26dns.custom_fallback%3D%26dns.enabled%3Dfalse%26dns.fallback_mode%3DSystem%26dns.filters%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ffilters.adtidy.org%252Fwindows%252Ffilters%252F15.txt%252CUser%2Brules%26dns.filters_enabled%3Dtrue%26dns.servers%3Dquic%253A%252F%252Fdns.adguard-dns.com%26dns.timeout%3D0%26filters%3D111.216.238.1.2.3.5.6.7%26license_type%3Dpaid%26parental_control.enabled%3Dfalse%26product_type%3DWin%26product_version%3D7.18.1%2B%25284778%2529%26referrer%3D%26stealth.DNT%3Dtrue%26stealth.block_third_party_auth%3Dfalse%26stealth.block_trackers%3Dtrue%26stealth.disable_third_party_cache%3Dfalse%26stealth.disable_wap_push_message_routing_service%3Dtrue%26stealth.disable_windows_defender%3Dtrue%26stealth.disable_windows_telemetry%3Dtrue%26stealth.dpi%3Dtrue%26stealth.enabled%3Dtrue%26stealth.flash%3Dtrue%26stealth.hide_search_queries%3Dtrue%26stealth.java%3Dfalse%26stealth.location%3Dtrue%26stealth.push%3Dtrue%26stealth.strip_url%3Dfalse%26stealth.third_party_cookies%3D180%26stealth.turn_off_advertising_id%3Dtrue%26stealth.webrtc%3Dtrue%26stealth.x_client%3Dtrue%26system_version%3DMicrosoft%2BWindows%2BNT%2B10.0.19045.0%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fyandex.ru%252Fsearch%252F%253Ftext%253Dpython%252Bpathlib%252Bunlink%2526clid%253D2372572%2526banerid%253D6301000000%25253A5f08fc7f0496650022daad73%2526win%253D445%2526from%253Dntp%2526lr%253D13%26user_agent%3DMozilla%252F5.0%2B%2528Windows%2BNT%2B10.0%253B%2BWin64%253B%2Bx64%2529%2BAppleWebKit%252F537.36%2B%2528KHTML%252C%2Blike%2BGecko%2529%2BChrome%252F126.0.0.0%2BYaBrowser%252F24.7.0.0%2BSafari%252F537.36%26userscripts%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgreasyfork.org%252Fscripts%252F386590-jps-random-torrent-button%252Fcode%252FJPS%252520Random%252520Torrent%252520Button.user.js%252Chttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fadguard-extra%252F1.0%252Fadguard-extra.user.js%252Chttps%253A%252F%252Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%252Frelease%252Fpopup-blocker%252F2.5%252Fpopupblocker.user.js%26utm_campaign%3Dreport%26utm_medium%3Dassistant%26utm_source%3Dwin%26win.wfp%3Dfalse)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185797/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-08T08:18:14Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Adguard полностью не работает на странице поиска яндекса. Не работают даже пользовательские правила, не связанные с рекламой - вообще никакие.

Adguard не совершает никакую блокировку\r\nUsername: `@ISkIN-AI`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Comment\r\n> Adguard полностью не работает на странице поиска яндекса. Не работают даже пользовательские правила, не связанные с рекламой - вообще никакие.

Adguard не совершает никакую блокировку\r\nUsername: `@ISkIN-AI`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Comment\r\n> Adguard полностью не работает на странице поиска яндекса. Не работают даже пользовательские правила, не связанные с рекламой - вообще никакие. Для теста попробовал заблокировать элемент по (статическому) классу - при предпросмотре он исчезает, но после после перезагрузки элемент с таким же классом снова появляется, т.е. Adguard не совершает никакую блокировку\r\nUsername: `@ISkIN-AI`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Добрый день. AdGuard для iOS работает только в браузере Safari. В других приложениях AdGuard блокирует рекламу с помощью функции DNS (блокируя DNS-запросы). К сожалению, для многих сайтов этого недостаточно — помимо блокировки запросов, нужны правила, взаимодействующие с контентом страницы, чтобы полностью заблокировать рекламу. Так как в Telegram используется встроенный браузер, применить эти правила на данный момент невозможно.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2275846259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-08T13:33:05Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Prerequisites\n\n- [X] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [X] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [X] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nHi! As a user, i think the [BaseFilter](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/tree/master/BaseFilter/sections) is based on the English language. So, i think it is unnecessary for English-only users to have the [foreign](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/BaseFilter/sections/foreign.txt) filter listed in the [BaseFilter](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/tree/master/BaseFilter/sections).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n[foreign](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/BaseFilter/sections/foreign.txt) filter should be moved from [BaseFilter](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/tree/master/BaseFilter/sections) to [AdguardFilters](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters) with make a new section `ForeignFilter`. As end user i think it should be in the language specific list and according to the number of filter uses, it will be useful in terms of usage.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130772/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130772/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2276056939","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130772#issuecomment-2276056939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130772","id":2276056939,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86Hqd9r","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-08T15:05:05Z","updated_at":"2024-08-08T15:05:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"These filters I can enable, when I get an error.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Details</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d802cbef-6f93-4a78-b3cb-94663a2b175b)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2b53063-13ff-4433-93fc-c61beaff45ad)\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2276056939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-08T15:05:07Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Hello,\r\n> \r\n> I am experiencing an issue with the TTAutoRecord repository when my AdGuard software is enabled. I am using the stable version 7.18.1 (4778) with a lifetime license for three devices. When AdGuard is active, I receive the following errors:\r\n> \r\n>     ERROR - Error processing [username]: Message: Tried to run command without establishing a connection\r\n>     WebDriverException occurred: Message: Failed to decode response from marionette\r\n> \r\n> These errors seem to indicate a connection or communication problem, and I suspect this might be related to AdGuard. Could you please confirm if AdGuard could be causing these issues? If so, do you have any recommendations for resolving this conflict?\r\n> \r\n> Thank you in advance for your assistance.\r\nUsername: `@FabLeKebab`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/a6bmj1fmtq0wo048ckgc48kwwow440wr392rujhpao.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4wtvl6n8i0sgs4k0s00kgwcw0k88cowg11mpk3p014.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.18.1\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11, Version 23H2 \r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Google Public DNS`<br>filters: `https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/adguard-filters/`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Import issue configuration (AdGuard for Windows)\r\n[Import](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=adguard%3Aimport_user_configuration%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252FCoombaa%252FTTAutoRecord)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185352/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2276379566","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185352#issuecomment-2276379566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185352","id":2276379566,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86Hrsuu","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-08T18:03:11Z","updated_at":"2024-08-08T18:03:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think it is not enabled to used filters, DNS protection and Stealth mode.

Comment\r\n> Hello,\r\n> \r\n> I am experiencing an issue with the TTAutoRecord repository when my AdGuard software is enabled. I am using the stable version 7.18.1 (4778) with a lifetime license for three devices. When AdGuard is active, I receive the following errors:\r\n> \r\n>     ERROR - Error processing [username]: Message: Tried to run command without establishing a connection\r\n>     WebDriverException occurred: Message: Failed to decode response from marionette\r\n> \r\n> These errors seem to indicate a connection or communication problem, and I suspect this might be related to AdGuard. Could you please confirm if AdGuard could be causing these issues? If so, do you have any recommendations for resolving this conflict?\r\n> \r\n> Thank you in advance for your assistance.\r\nUsername: `@FabLeKebab`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/a6bmj1fmtq0wo048ckgc48kwwow440wr392rujhpao.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4wtvl6n8i0sgs4k0s00kgwcw0k88cowg11mpk3p014.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.18.1\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11, Version 23H2 \r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Google Public DNS`<br>filters: `https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/adguard-filters/`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Ukrainian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Import issue configuration (AdGuard for Windows)\r\n[Import](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=adguard%3Aimport_user_configuration%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252FCoombaa%252FTTAutoRecord)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185352/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2276618342","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185352#issuecomment-2276618342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/185352","id":2276618342,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86HsnBm","user":{"login":"FabLeKebab","id":109556581,"node_id":"U_kgDOBoezZQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109556581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab","html_url":"https://github.com/FabLeKebab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FabLeKebab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-08T20:42:02Z","updated_at":"2024-08-08T20:42:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @FabLeKebab\r\n> \r\n> > Pour répondre à la première question\r\n> \r\n> Je veux dire, vous pouvez tester sans ces modules pour trouver la raison du problème.\r\n> \r\n> > Faites-vous référence aux filtres que je mets à jour manuellement ?

When I disabled this module, an error occurred immediately after, displaying: _\"An unexpected exception occurred: Message: Failed to decode response from marionette.\"_ \r\n\r\nWhen I update the filters, it often happens that nothing occurs and no error is displayed.\r\n\r\nI just repeated the same operation with the DNS module, and the previously mentioned error occurred again, confirming the issue. I'll run a test tomorrow, or maybe even tonight, by leaving the device on all night. If no error appears while the DNS module is disabled, it will confirm that the problem is indeed related to the DNS module.\r\n\r\nI'll return here tomorrow morning to provide an update on the situation after letting it run all night.
