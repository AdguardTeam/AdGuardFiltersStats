A fix would be appreciated for devices unable to install extensions or the full Adguard application.\r\n> \r\n> When watching non-live programme/movie, a black screen shows for approximately 35 seconds before it begins. The same happens during the programme/movie when designated ad break slots are meant to appear.\r\n> \r\n> The page appears to be attempting to load the ads, however after approximately 35 gives up and plays the programme/film without them.\r\n> \r\n> This does not effect Live TV.\r\n> \r\n> This does NOT effect the My5 Android/iOS/tvOS apps - they block ads correctly without pause.
