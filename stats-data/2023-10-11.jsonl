I researched why it disappeared, and it's because the URL changed.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nPlease use the following text file to reintroduce this list:\r\n\r\nhttps://paulgb.github.io/BarbBlock/blacklists/adblock-plus.txt\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe domains in this list can detect where blocking is an issue for these companies. They then use these analytics to write cease & desist letters to the developers of the blocklists, forcing them to comply or end up in court. To avoid any issues down the road, please implement this list by default.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163578/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1756484463","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163578#issuecomment-1756484463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163578","id":1756484463,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85osdNv","user":{"login":"TheHadouJHyrule","id":67041781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDQxNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67041781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHadouJHyrule","html_url":"https://github.com/TheHadouJHyrule","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHadouJHyrule/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHadouJHyrule/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHadouJHyrule/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHadouJHyrule/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHadouJHyrule/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHadouJHyrule/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHadouJHyrule/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHadouJHyrule/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHadouJHyrule/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-11T00:04:00Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T00:04:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm not sure which category this belongs in.
