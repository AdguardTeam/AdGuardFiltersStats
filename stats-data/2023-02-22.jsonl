Comment\r\n> Cuando la extensión está deshabilitada,  ingreso la palabra en la casilla y no hace nada en absoluto. Pero cuando deshabilito la extensión y vuelvo a ingresar la palabra en la casilla de este diccionario, sale la definición y por supuesto emerge el anuncio en la parte derecha de la pantalla sin AdGuard. Además sale videos de hasta diez segundos de vez en cuando.  Hace un tiempo que ha dejado de funcionar, pero solía funcionar bien antes. No hay ningún resultado al ingresar palabras en la casilla y pulsar la tecla enter sin deshabilitar AdGuard. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/LGKHmka.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/3xKdQQT.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/143586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/143586/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-22T07:03:13Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
