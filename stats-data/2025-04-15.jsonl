movies, docomentries etc, where I left off because the Watch Progress is not syncing.\n\nSo for example : if I only watch 15 minutes of one specific show and then stop, if I return back to that specific show later, playback DOES NOT resume from the 15 minute mark, instead that specific show by default will restart from the very beginning.\n\nCan this bug be patched/fixed on the
