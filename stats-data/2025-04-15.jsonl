movies, docomentries etc, where I left off because the Watch Progress is not syncing.\n\nSo for example : if I only watch 15 minutes of one specific show and then stop, if I return back to that specific show later, playback DOES NOT resume from the 15 minute mark, instead that specific show by default will restart from the very beginning.\n\nCan this bug be patched/fixed on the

ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.

The mobile version of https://ozon.ru may occasionally display a blank white screen. In order to reproduce the issue, you may need to reload the page a couple of times. You must be logged in in order to reproduce the issue (If necessary, I can provide you with an account). Disabling the \"AdGuard – Mobile Ads\" filter list fixes the issue. Disabling cosmetic filters also fixes the issue. Reproducible on both Kiwi Browser and Fennec from F-Droid.\n\n2.
