Comment\r\n> The OpenWeb comment module on any Yahoo news page does not work correctly in FireFox browser when AdGuard is active.  \r\n> \r\n> There should be 2 control buttons at the top of the module but only one appears and when the mouse is moved over that button it vanishes.\r\n> \r\n> There should be a \"thumbs up\" button and a \"thumbs down\" button on each posted comment but only the \"thumbs down\" button appears.\r\n> \r\n> These problems do not exist when AdGuard is disabled.\r\n> \r\n> These problems do not occur when I use \r\n> Edge browser and have AdGuard activated.\r\nUsername: `@DeeV`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
