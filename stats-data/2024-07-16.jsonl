Comment\r\n> The OpenWeb comment module on any Yahoo news page does not work correctly in FireFox browser when AdGuard is active.  \r\n> \r\n> There should be 2 control buttons at the top of the module but only one appears and when the mouse is moved over that button it vanishes.\r\n> \r\n> There should be a \"thumbs up\" button and a \"thumbs down\" button on each posted comment but only the \"thumbs down\" button appears.\r\n> \r\n> These problems do not exist when AdGuard is disabled.\r\n> \r\n> These problems do not occur when I use \r\n> Edge browser and have AdGuard activated.\r\nUsername: `@DeeV`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://2gis.ru/moscow](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2F2gis.ru%2Fmoscow)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Если работать с сайтом 2ГИС со смартфона через браузер а не через их мобильное приложение, то если AdGuard включен то невозможно начать пользоваться сайтом поскольку вся страница сайта является затемнённой и не реагирует на касания пользователя. Когда выключил AdGuard то оказалось что AdGuard блокирует один элемент который изначально накладывается на сайт поверх и требует обязательного выбора со стороны пользователя (нужно выбрать и нажать остаться на сайте или перейти в мобильное приложение) (данный элемент скорее всего отображается сайтом не зависимо от того установлено или нет их мобильное приложение, у меня оно не установлено)... Т.е. когда я временно отключил защиту в AdGuard и обновил страницу в браузере то этот элемент появился поверх страницы сайта и после того как я нажал в нём нужную кнопку чтобы остаться на сайте то он пропал но и страница сайта стала не затемнённой и сайтом стало можно пользоватся... Если повторно заходить на сайт не очищая данные браузера то потом уже проблема не повторяется и сайт работает нормально даже с включенным AdGuard, но после очистки данных браузера и при последующем заходе на сайт проблема повторяется снова... Воспроизведение по этому сценарию всегда стабильное... Москва взята только как пример и город по умолчанию на сайте наверное... А так эта проблема воспроизводится для карты любого города... Нужно бы наверное подправить что-то в каком-то из фильтров AdGuard... Заранее спасибо.
