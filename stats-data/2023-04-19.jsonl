Не получаеться зайти на https://www.mos.ru/ при активном adguard\r\n> Если в настройках выключена «Расширенная защита от отслеживания», то все окей. Если включаешь, со всеми опциями, то какое-то время сайт работает, а потом перестает отвечать. Если выключаешь Антитрекинг, то все-равно не отрывается сайт. Только после полного выключения/включения adguard(с выключенным антитрекингом) снова его оживляют.\r\n> Пробовал включать опции, в антитрекинге, по очереди.

Не получаеться зайти на https://www.mos.ru/ при активном adguard\r\n> Если в настройках выключена «Расширенная защита от отслеживания», то все окей. Если включаешь, со всеми опциями, то какое-то время сайт работает, а потом перестает отвечать. Если выключаешь Антитрекинг, то все-равно не отрывается сайт. Только после полного выключения/включения adguard(с выключенным антитрекингом) снова его оживляют.\r\n> Пробовал включать опции, в антитрекинге, по очереди.

variety of third-party DNS providers, along with the regular AdGuard DNS, return the correct IP addresses for Etsy, but AdGuard Family returns 94.140.14.35 as the IP address for www.etsy.com;  that turns out to be the blocked-site page, which fails with a privacy error because the blocked-site page does not have a TLS certificate for etsy.com and that domain has HSTS (one of the bundled HSTS pins in recent browsers), so the TLS failure cannot be bypassed (I forgot to open the \"Advanced\" button when taking that screenshot, but that's basically what that message said).\r\n> \r\n> I fail
