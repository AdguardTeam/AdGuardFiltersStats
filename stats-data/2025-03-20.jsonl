It’s unclear precisely which filters are causing this, but after posting on Reddit, other users confirmed that AdGuard is causing similar issues for them as well.\r\n> \r\n> I have also posted a video demonstrating the problem on Reddit:\r\n> https://www.reddit.com/r/duckduckgo/comments/1jeup8z/whats_happened_to_duckduckgo_its_extremely_slow/\r\n> \r\n> This issue did not occur until March 17, 2025. It’s likely that a filter update performed automatically after this date caused this problem.\r\n> \r\n> I tested this issue with AdGuard for iOS and Safari, but the problem does not occur on those platforms. The filters are fully updated, and the following filters are active on my iOS device:\r\n> - AdGuard Base filter\r\n> - AdGuard Mobile Ads filter\r\n> - AdGuard Tracking Protection filter\r\n> - AdGuard Japanese filter\r\n> \r\n> Given the above, it seems likely that a filter enabled exclusively on the macOS version—outside the four filters listed above—is responsible for causing this issue.\r\n> \r\n> DNS settings and other browser extensions are unrelated. My environment has not changed at all, except for the automatic AdGuard filter updates.\r\n> \r\n> **Original Text (Japanese)**\r\n> DuckDuckGoで検索を行った際、AdGuardがオンになっていると検索結果の表示までに5秒以上10秒以下の遅延が起きてしまう問題\r\n> AdGuardのホワイトリストにduckduckgo.comを追加すると問題は発生しません。\r\n> 一時、AdGuard Tracking Protection filterをオフにしてみると問題が解決されたかのように見えましたが、その後再び確認してみるとまだ問題が発生しており、おそらく複数のフィルターで問題を引き起こしているようです。\r\n> DuckDuckGoの他のページでは問題が発生しておらず、DuckDuckGoの検索結果の表示のみが遅延します。正確にどのフィルターがこの問題を引き起こしているのかは不明で、Redditに投稿してみたところ、他のユーザもAdGuardが同じくこの問題を引き起こしているとの報告がありました。\r\n> 問題の検証動画もRedditに投稿しています。\r\n> https://www.reddit.com/r/duckduckgo/comments/1jeup8z/whats_happened_to_duckduckgo_its_extremely_slow/\r\n> \r\n> この問題は、2025年3月17日までは起きていませんでした。その後、自動で行われたフィルターアップデートがこの問題を引き起こしたと思われます。\r\n> iOS用AdGuardでも試してみましたが、iOS用AdGuardとSafariでは問題が再現されませんでした。フィルターは最新にアップデートしており、以下のフィルターがオンの状態です：AdGuardベースフィルタ,AdGuardモバイル広告フィルタ、AdGuard追跡防止フィルタ,AdGuard日本語フィルタ\r\n> なので、おそらく上記の4つ以外の、macOS版でのみ有効になっているフィルターがこの問題を引き起こしていると思われます。DNS設定やその他の拡張機能はこの問題とは関係ありません。他の環境は全く変わっておらず、変わっているのはAdGuardのフィルターアップデートのみです。\r\nUsername: `@lilyharuna`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/myae24xl7y804co0kkg4sc4wwksgg0kpt0oydc63eo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/o1wgd74aa4gwwo0k08g8cskgwc0swo83jlwvz9ctu0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.16.4.1870 release\r\nSystem version: | macOS Sequoia 15.3.2\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `1.1.1.1`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>List-KR, <br/>AdBlockID\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Grammarly for Safari, Kuar, Userscripts, Wayback Machine\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=1.1.1.1)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201258/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-20T01:22:21Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

However, upon further testing, the issue reappeared, suggesting multiple filters might be contributing to this problem.\r\n> \r\n> This issue doesn’t affect other DuckDuckGo pages; it occurs exclusively with displaying search results. It’s unclear precisely which filters are causing this, but after posting on Reddit, other users confirmed that AdGuard is causing similar issues for them as well.\r\n> \r\n> I have also posted a video demonstrating the problem on Reddit:\r\n> https://www.reddit.com/r/duckduckgo/comments/1jeup8z/whats_happened_to_duckduckgo_its_extremely_slow/\r\n> \r\n> This issue did not occur until March 17, 2025. It’s likely that a filter update performed automatically after this date caused this problem.\r\n> \r\n> I tested this issue with AdGuard for iOS and Safari, but the problem does not occur on those platforms. The filters are fully updated, and the following filters are active on my iOS device:\r\n> - AdGuard Base filter\r\n> - AdGuard Mobile Ads filter\r\n> - AdGuard Tracking Protection filter\r\n> - AdGuard Japanese filter\r\n> \r\n> Given the above, it seems likely that a filter enabled exclusively on the macOS version—outside the four filters listed above—is responsible for causing this issue.\r\n> \r\n> DNS settings and other browser extensions are unrelated. My environment has not changed at all, except for the automatic AdGuard filter updates.\r\n> \r\n> **Original Text (Japanese)**\r\n> DuckDuckGoで検索を行った際、AdGuardがオンになっていると検索結果の表示までに5秒以上10秒以下の遅延が起きてしまう問題\r\n> AdGuardのホワイトリストにduckduckgo.comを追加すると問題は発生しません。\r\n> 一時、AdGuard Tracking Protection filterをオフにしてみると問題が解決されたかのように見えましたが、その後再び確認してみるとまだ問題が発生しており、おそらく複数のフィルターで問題を引き起こしているようです。\r\n> DuckDuckGoの他のページでは問題が発生しておらず、DuckDuckGoの検索結果の表示のみが遅延します。正確にどのフィルターがこの問題を引き起こしているのかは不明で、Redditに投稿してみたところ、他のユーザもAdGuardが同じくこの問題を引き起こしているとの報告がありました。\r\n> 問題の検証動画もRedditに投稿しています。\r\n> https://www.reddit.com/r/duckduckgo/comments/1jeup8z/whats_happened_to_duckduckgo_its_extremely_slow/\r\n> \r\n> この問題は、2025年3月17日までは起きていませんでした。その後、自動で行われたフィルターアップデートがこの問題を引き起こしたと思われます。\r\n> iOS用AdGuardでも試してみましたが、iOS用AdGuardとSafariでは問題が再現されませんでした。フィルターは最新にアップデートしており、以下のフィルターがオンの状態です：AdGuardベースフィルタ,AdGuardモバイル広告フィルタ、AdGuard追跡防止フィルタ,AdGuard日本語フィルタ\r\n> なので、おそらく上記の4つ以外の、macOS版でのみ有効になっているフィルターがこの問題を引き起こしていると思われます。DNS設定やその他の拡張機能はこの問題とは関係ありません。他の環境は全く変わっておらず、変わっているのはAdGuardのフィルターアップデートのみです。\r\nUsername: `@lilyharuna`\r\n\r\n###

However, upon further testing, the issue reappeared, suggesting multiple filters might be contributing to this problem.\r\n> \r\n> This issue doesn’t affect other DuckDuckGo pages; it occurs exclusively with displaying search results. It’s unclear precisely which filters are causing this, but after posting on Reddit, other users confirmed that AdGuard is causing similar issues for them as well.\r\n> \r\n> I have also posted a video demonstrating the problem on Reddit:\r\n> https://www.reddit.com/r/duckduckgo/comments/1jeup8z/whats_happened_to_duckduckgo_its_extremely_slow/\r\n> \r\n> This issue did not occur until March 17, 2025. It’s likely that a filter update performed automatically after this date caused this problem.\r\n> \r\n> I tested this issue with AdGuard for iOS and Safari, but the problem does not occur on those platforms. The filters are fully updated, and the following filters are active on my iOS device:\r\n> - AdGuard Base filter\r\n> - AdGuard Mobile Ads filter\r\n> - AdGuard Tracking Protection filter\r\n> - AdGuard Japanese filter\r\n> \r\n> Given the above, it seems likely that a filter enabled exclusively on the macOS version—outside the four filters listed above—is responsible for causing this issue.\r\n> \r\n> DNS settings and other browser extensions are unrelated. My environment has not changed at all, except for the automatic AdGuard filter updates.\r\n> \r\n> **Original Text (Japanese)**\r\n> DuckDuckGoで検索を行った際、AdGuardがオンになっていると検索結果の表示までに5秒以上10秒以下の遅延が起きてしまう問題\r\n> AdGuardのホワイトリストにduckduckgo.comを追加すると問題は発生しません。\r\n> 一時、AdGuard Tracking Protection filterをオフにしてみると問題が解決されたかのように見えましたが、その後再び確認してみるとまだ問題が発生しており、おそらく複数のフィルターで問題を引き起こしているようです。\r\n> DuckDuckGoの他のページでは問題が発生しておらず、DuckDuckGoの検索結果の表示のみが遅延します。正確にどのフィルターがこの問題を引き起こしているのかは不明で、Redditに投稿してみたところ、他のユーザもAdGuardが同じくこの問題を引き起こしているとの報告がありました。\r\n> 問題の検証動画もRedditに投稿しています。\r\n> https://www.reddit.com/r/duckduckgo/comments/1jeup8z/whats_happened_to_duckduckgo_its_extremely_slow/\r\n> \r\n> この問題は、2025年3月17日までは起きていませんでした。その後、自動で行われたフィルターアップデートがこの問題を引き起こしたと思われます。\r\n> iOS用AdGuardでも試してみましたが、iOS用AdGuardとSafariでは問題が再現されませんでした。フィルターは最新にアップデートしており、以下のフィルターがオンの状態です：AdGuardベースフィルタ,AdGuardモバイル広告フィルタ、AdGuard追跡防止フィルタ,AdGuard日本語フィルタ\r\n> なので、おそらく上記の4つ以外の、macOS版でのみ有効になっているフィルターがこの問題を引き起こしていると思われます。DNS設定やその他の拡張機能はこの問題とは関係ありません。他の環境は全く変わっておらず、変わっているのはAdGuardのフィルターアップデートのみです。\r\nUsername: `@lilyharuna`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/myae24xl7y804co0kkg4sc4wwksgg0kpt0oydc63eo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/o1wgd74aa4gwwo0k08g8cskgwc0swo83jlwvz9ctu0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.16.4.1870 release\r\nSystem version: | macOS Sequoia 15.3.2\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `1.1.1.1`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>List-KR, <br/>AdBlockID\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Grammarly for Safari, Kuar, Userscripts, Wayback Machine\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=1.1.1.1)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201258/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2738866471","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201258#issuecomment-2738866471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201258","id":2738866471,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86jP8kn","user":{"login":"laanito","id":9811803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MTE4MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9811803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laanito","html_url":"https://github.com/laanito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laanito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laanito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laanito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laanito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laanito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laanito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laanito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laanito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laanito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-20T02:03:29Z","updated_at":"2025-03-20T02:03:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"duckduckgo makes a request to links.duckduckgo.com in order to retrieve organics, this request is being blocked.

The filters are fully updated, and the following filters are active on my iOS device:\r\n> - AdGuard Base filter\r\n> - AdGuard Mobile Ads filter\r\n> - AdGuard Tracking Protection filter\r\n> - AdGuard Japanese filter\r\n> \r\n> Given the above, it seems likely that a filter enabled exclusively on the macOS version—outside the four filters listed above—is responsible for causing this issue.\r\n> \r\n> DNS settings and other browser extensions are unrelated. My environment has not changed at all, except for the automatic AdGuard filter updates.\r\n> \r\n> **Original Text (Japanese)**\r\n> DuckDuckGoで検索を行った際、AdGuardがオンになっていると検索結果の表示までに5秒以上10秒以下の遅延が起きてしまう問題\r\n> AdGuardのホワイトリストにduckduckgo.comを追加すると問題は発生しません。\r\n> 一時、AdGuard Tracking Protection filterをオフにしてみると問題が解決されたかのように見えましたが、その後再び確認してみるとまだ問題が発生しており、おそらく複数のフィルターで問題を引き起こしているようです。\r\n> DuckDuckGoの他のページでは問題が発生しておらず、DuckDuckGoの検索結果の表示のみが遅延します。正確にどのフィルターがこの問題を引き起こしているのかは不明で、Redditに投稿してみたところ、他のユーザもAdGuardが同じくこの問題を引き起こしているとの報告がありました。\r\n> 問題の検証動画もRedditに投稿しています。\r\n> https://www.reddit.com/r/duckduckgo/comments/1jeup8z/whats_happened_to_duckduckgo_its_extremely_slow/\r\n> \r\n> この問題は、2025年3月17日までは起きていませんでした。その後、自動で行われたフィルターアップデートがこの問題を引き起こしたと思われます。\r\n> iOS用AdGuardでも試してみましたが、iOS用AdGuardとSafariでは問題が再現されませんでした。フィルターは最新にアップデートしており、以下のフィルターがオンの状態です：AdGuardベースフィルタ,AdGuardモバイル広告フィルタ、AdGuard追跡防止フィルタ,AdGuard日本語フィルタ\r\n> なので、おそらく上記の4つ以外の、macOS版でのみ有効になっているフィルターがこの問題を引き起こしていると思われます。DNS設定やその他の拡張機能はこの問題とは関係ありません。他の環境は全く変わっておらず、変わっているのはAdGuardのフィルターアップデートのみです。\r\nUsername: `@lilyharuna`\r\n\r\n###

However, upon further testing, the issue reappeared, suggesting multiple filters might be contributing to this problem.\r\n> \r\n> This issue doesn’t affect other DuckDuckGo pages; it occurs exclusively with displaying search results. It’s unclear precisely which filters are causing this, but after posting on Reddit, other users confirmed that AdGuard is causing similar issues for them as well.\r\n> \r\n> I have also posted a video demonstrating the problem on Reddit:\r\n> https://www.reddit.com/r/duckduckgo/comments/1jeup8z/whats_happened_to_duckduckgo_its_extremely_slow/\r\n> \r\n> This issue did not occur until March 17, 2025. It’s likely that a filter update performed automatically after this date caused this problem.\r\n> \r\n> I tested this issue with AdGuard for iOS and Safari, but the problem does not occur on those platforms. The filters are fully updated, and the following filters are active on my iOS device:\r\n> - AdGuard Base filter\r\n> - AdGuard Mobile Ads filter\r\n> - AdGuard Tracking Protection filter\r\n> - AdGuard Japanese filter\r\n> \r\n> Given the above, it seems likely that a filter enabled exclusively on the macOS version—outside the four filters listed above—is responsible for causing this issue.\r\n> \r\n> DNS settings and other browser extensions are unrelated. My environment has not changed at all, except for the automatic AdGuard filter updates.\r\n> \r\n> **Original Text (Japanese)**\r\n> DuckDuckGoで検索を行った際、AdGuardがオンになっていると検索結果の表示までに5秒以上10秒以下の遅延が起きてしまう問題\r\n> AdGuardのホワイトリストにduckduckgo.comを追加すると問題は発生しません。\r\n> 一時、AdGuard Tracking Protection filterをオフにしてみると問題が解決されたかのように見えましたが、その後再び確認してみるとまだ問題が発生しており、おそらく複数のフィルターで問題を引き起こしているようです。\r\n> DuckDuckGoの他のページでは問題が発生しておらず、DuckDuckGoの検索結果の表示のみが遅延します。正確にどのフィルターがこの問題を引き起こしているのかは不明で、Redditに投稿してみたところ、他のユーザもAdGuardが同じくこの問題を引き起こしているとの報告がありました。\r\n> 問題の検証動画もRedditに投稿しています。\r\n> https://www.reddit.com/r/duckduckgo/comments/1jeup8z/whats_happened_to_duckduckgo_its_extremely_slow/\r\n> \r\n> この問題は、2025年3月17日までは起きていませんでした。その後、自動で行われたフィルターアップデートがこの問題を引き起こしたと思われます。\r\n> iOS用AdGuardでも試してみましたが、iOS用AdGuardとSafariでは問題が再現されませんでした。フィルターは最新にアップデートしており、以下のフィルターがオンの状態です：AdGuardベースフィルタ,AdGuardモバイル広告フィルタ、AdGuard追跡防止フィルタ,AdGuard日本語フィルタ\r\n> なので、おそらく上記の4つ以外の、macOS版でのみ有効になっているフィルターがこの問題を引き起こしていると思われます。DNS設定やその他の拡張機能はこの問題とは関係ありません。他の環境は全く変わっておらず、変わっているのはAdGuardのフィルターアップデートのみです。\r\nUsername: `@lilyharuna`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/myae24xl7y804co0kkg4sc4wwksgg0kpt0oydc63eo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/o1wgd74aa4gwwo0k08g8cskgwc0swo83jlwvz9ctu0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.16.4.1870 release\r\nSystem version: | macOS Sequoia 15.3.2\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `1.1.1.1`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>List-KR, <br/>AdBlockID\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Grammarly for Safari, Kuar, Userscripts, Wayback Machine\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?dns.servers=1.1.1.1)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201258/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2738981043","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201258#issuecomment-2738981043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201258","id":2738981043,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86jQYiz","user":{"login":"jordansworld","id":180710643,"node_id":"U_kgDOCsVs8w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180710643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld","html_url":"https://github.com/jordansworld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansworld/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-20T02:46:56Z","updated_at":"2025-03-20T02:46:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> In https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersRegistry/master/filters/filter_2_Base/filter.txt Unchecking the line `||links.duckduckgo.com/d.js?q=` makes duckduckgo work again\n> \n> ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/053ed3bd-a954-4bbc-a82f-f5d1f95ff2fb)\n\nworks!

\r\n> \r\n> I've had Adguard installed on Android and Windows 11 Chrome browser (the AG browser extension, not the system AG app) for a while, but this glitch accessing Bleacherreport.com (\"something went wrong - try reloading\" message) wasn't noticed til the last couple of weeks...\r\n> \r\n> I reported it to the site's support department, and they mentioned that they couldn't reproduce it on their end and suggested it could be VPN-related - however I don't have a vpn running while trying to access the site on either platform. \r\n> \r\n> Disabling the extension and mobile app do seem to fix the error message. It should be noted that adding the site to the \"Allowlist\" in the browser extension does not work. \r\n> \r\n> Thanks for any guidance. \r\n> \r\nUsername: `@GitAlexToTheGreek`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/asg4dyn9frscg84gskcckwgk8k44gsklr2r1tj6huo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ryvogh013qs8c0gcgkgsk8gkkks40kcqf3mehl1k4g.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.0.210 MV3\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard French\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Bitdefender Antivirus Free Build 27.0.49.250, Extensions: AdGuard, Bitwarden, Dark Reader, Enhancer For YouTube, Extensity, Free Download Manager, Read Aloud, Scrolling Screenshot & Full Page Markup App, Selection Search ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2739367079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-20T06:45:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

move this filter rules:\r\n> https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/905f20a5d04e586b812f7e4ba9059591383ae484/TurkishFilter/sections/specific.txt#L4264-L4268\r\n> To above the following filter rule:\r\n> https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/052f94d777fb98ce8407821c5faefe2ad68e665b/TurkishFilter/sections/specific.txt#L3952\r\n> Due to this issue: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/201048\r\n> \r\n> ---------\r\n> \r\n> Secondly:\r\n> \r\n> Those filters are outdated:\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/052f94d777fb98ce8407821c5faefe2ad68e665b/TurkishFilter/sections/specific.txt#L3955-L3957\r\n>

issues like:\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersCompiler/issues/241\r\n> https://github.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersCompiler/issues/237\r\n> \r\n> But this filter works fine on the uBO (Better than nothing):\r\n> \r\n> Suggestion:\r\n> \r\n> ```adblock\r\n> ||video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/*/*.m3u8$domain=/^[a-zA-Z]{1,4}\\.[a-zA-Z0-9]{15,}.*\\d+.*\\.click$/\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> But also add this too (Sometimes there are alternative links):\r\n> \r\n> ```adblock\r\n> ||video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/*/*.m3u8$domain=/selcuksportshd\\d+\\.xyz/\r\n> ```\r\nUsername:
