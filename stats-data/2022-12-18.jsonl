AdGuard Filters and AdGuard Home) see pretty much no maintenance nor processing on weekends. If someone files an issue report on a Friday afternoon, they're pretty much never looked into before Mondays 10:00 CET at earliest.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nHire additional (or change the working days of some existing) AdGuard employees or contractors, for the primary purpose of making AdGuard products maintained 7 days a week instead of just 5.\n\n### Additional information\n\nI know uBlock Origin is pretty much a 7-days-a-week project that could be used as a de facto example to compare against, even if they are a non-profit group. On the other hand, I'm not 100% sure about Eyeo's workdays.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/137729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/137729/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-12-18T17:59:56Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
