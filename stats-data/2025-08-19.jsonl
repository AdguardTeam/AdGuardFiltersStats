I'm using Adguard Home with Adguard QUIC (other protocols untested) DNS upstream configured. It returns `127.0.0.1` as an answer for `www.themoviedb.org`. As I understand, this is commonly used for blocking. However, I couldn't find it in your filterlists, besides the [allow rule](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/bc4da839f3cbccbb786c94fe0dfa6b920fef3a2d/BaseFilter/sections/allowlist_stealth.txt#L364) for unbreaking.\n\n2.
