Comment\r\nUsername: @Batman2814\r\n> When Adguard for Windows is enabled. The 2-step verification process for RBC (Royal Bank Of Canada) will not work after I press trust on the trusted device so it can log me into my RBC account. When I disabled Adguard for Windows the 2-step verification that is set up with my RBC had no problem signing me in. I'm able to type my username and password but as soon as it gets to the 2-step verification that's when Adguard for Windows blocks me from signing in.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/8XNhwU2.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/0bkKS30.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.13+nightly+3\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash, <br>Block Java, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (www.rbcroyalbank.com), <br>Hide your User-Agent (), <br>Hide your IP address (208.54.104.184)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://1a9171ae.d.adguard-dns.com`<br>filters: `User+rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List, <br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | bitdefender Anti-tracker, duckduckgo, WOT Extension ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-20T11:42:57Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @quaybj\r\n> This food ordering site has the option to get weekly discounts.  The link to the promotion number and the discounted list does not work with adguard installed on my machines (MAC and PC). I have Chrome, Firefox, and Brave.  That particular URL is blocked for all of them.  I am using https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query in my router DNS setting.  Disabling adguard in the browsers does not work, maybe because it's the router DNS?  The picture where the box is seen is from a machine where adguard is not installed at all.  \r\n> \r\n> While making this query, I saw a lot of references to information on the settings for adguard, can you point me to the manual?

Comment\r\n> Суть ситуации: есть необходимость быстрого просмотра пабликов VK в браузере Яндекс без регистрации. При этом хочется убрать рекламу в пабликах, т.к. она не относится к нужному контенту и исключить назойливые плашки о регистрации. Сначала пробовал включить AdGuard в режим VPN, все работает замечательно - рекламы нет, раздражителей нет. Но при этом некоторые приложения на Android телефоне (Сбербанк, Wildberries), даже добавленные в исключения AdGuard, продолжают напоминать про VPN. Это тоже определенный раздражитель. В режиме локального HTTP прокси напоминаний про VPN нет, но \"отваливается\" DNS фильтр и AdGuard начинает пропускать рекламу и раздражители.

Comment\r\n> Суть ситуации: есть необходимость быстрого просмотра пабликов VK в браузере Яндекс без регистрации. При этом хочется убрать рекламу в пабликах, т.к. она не относится к нужному контенту и исключить назойливые плашки о регистрации. Сначала пробовал включить AdGuard в режим VPN, все работает замечательно - рекламы нет, раздражителей нет. Но при этом некоторые приложения на Android телефоне (Сбербанк, Wildberries), даже добавленные в исключения AdGuard, продолжают напоминать про VPN. Это тоже определенный раздражитель. В режиме локального HTTP прокси напоминаний про VPN нет, но \"отваливается\" DNS фильтр и AdGuard начинает пропускать рекламу и раздражители. Данная проблема присутствует и на других пабликах - \"Киномания\" просто приведена в качестве иллюстрации. В общем, добиться комфортной работы пока не удалось.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/dTAC2hx.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/DzZrRjB.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/VMWCDUS.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://reports-img.adguard.com/yJXDFhb.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://reports-img.adguard.com/gfMT43z.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.11\r\nBrowser: | Yandex\r\nAdGuard mode: | proxy\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Hide your User-Agent ()\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>RU AdList: Counters\r\nUserscripts: | Adguard Extra\r\nOther extensions used: | Не имеются","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145616/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1476394575","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145616#issuecomment-1476394575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145616","id":1476394575,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85X__5P","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-20T15:01:43Z","updated_at":"2023-03-20T15:01:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"При использовании режима локального VPN, некоторые приложения могут игнорировать эту настройку.
