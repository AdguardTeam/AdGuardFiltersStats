A contributor @SeriousHoax brought my attention to this in response to my [tweet](https://twitter.com/Yuki27183/status/1626935791778922497) explaining uBO blocks 99 % of Lucky visitor scam by the rule. I could easily find issues which could have been blocked as the example above, and can say Browsing Security rarely blocks them. The rule has been in uBO badware and DandelionSprout's Anti-Malware list for years now with occasional adjustment and there was only one false positive due to too rough regex in the very early version. I omitted URL as nowadays their life becomes shorter and shorter - the link in the tweet got blocked by GSB few hours later of the tweet but at the time was already dead. If you need a fresh URL to test, I'll PM so that you can check within hours.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are met\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/143363/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/143363/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1441972196","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pull/143363#issuecomment-1441972196","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/143363","id":1441972196,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85V8r_k","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-23T15:23:19Z","updated_at":"2023-02-23T15:23:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Did you mean the following issue?\r\n - https://github.com/List-KR/List-KR/issues/598\r\n - https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/141681\r\n - https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/16596","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1441972196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-23T15:23:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

A contributor @SeriousHoax brought my attention to this in response to my [tweet](https://twitter.com/Yuki27183/status/1626935791778922497) explaining uBO blocks 99 % of Lucky visitor scam by the rule. I could easily find issues which could have been blocked as the example above, and can say Browsing Security rarely blocks them. The rule has been in uBO badware and DandelionSprout's Anti-Malware list for years now with occasional adjustment and there was only one false positive due to too rough regex in the very early version. I omitted URL as nowadays their life becomes shorter and shorter - the link in the tweet got blocked by GSB few hours later of the tweet but at the time was already dead. If you need a fresh URL to test, I'll PM so that you can check within hours.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are met\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/143363/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/143363/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1441947318","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pull/143363#issuecomment-1441947318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/143363","id":1441947318,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85V8l62","user":{"login":"Yuki2718","id":58900598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTAwNTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58900598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718","html_url":"https://github.com/Yuki2718","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuki2718/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-23T15:06:54Z","updated_at":"2023-02-23T15:06:54Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Found List-KR already has a similar rule: `/^https:\\/\\/[A-z0-9\\.]*[A-z0-9]+\\.[A-z]+\\/\\?u=[A-z0-9]{7}&o=[A-z0-9]{7}/$document` @piquark6046 \r\n\r\nHere when you searched for `adguard` in Japanese:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Screenshot</summary>\r\n\r\n![visitor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58900598/220946011-ff357149-5863-4906-863e-3f5d012d8815.png)\r\n\r\n</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1441947318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-23T15:06:55Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I could easily find issues which could have been blocked as the example above, and can say Browsing Security rarely blocks them. The rule has been in uBO badware and DandelionSprout's Anti-Malware list for years now with occasional adjustment and there was only one false positive due to too rough regex in the very early version. I omitted URL as nowadays their life becomes shorter and shorter - the link in the tweet got blocked by GSB few hours later of the tweet but at the time was already dead.
