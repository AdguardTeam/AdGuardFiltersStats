Just add <code>export HUSKY=0</code> to <code>.config/husky/init.sh</code>.</p>\n<p>I've seen some confusion about this on X, so just a heads-up!</p>\n<h1>Sponsoring</h1>\n<p>Husky is downloaded over 45M times per month and used by ~1.5M projects.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://2gis.ru/moscow](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2F2gis.ru%2Fmoscow)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Если работать с сайтом 2ГИС со смартфона через браузер а не через их мобильное приложение, то если AdGuard включен то невозможно начать пользоваться сайтом поскольку вся страница сайта является затемнённой и не реагирует на касания пользователя. Когда выключил AdGuard то оказалось что AdGuard блокирует один элемент который изначально накладывается на сайт поверх и требует обязательного выбора со стороны пользователя (нужно выбрать и нажать остаться на сайте или перейти в мобильное приложение) (данный элемент скорее всего отображается сайтом не зависимо от того установлено или нет их мобильное приложение, у меня оно не установлено)... Т.е. когда я временно отключил защиту в AdGuard и обновил страницу в браузере то этот элемент появился поверх страницы сайта и после того как я нажал в нём нужную кнопку чтобы остаться на сайте то он пропал но и страница сайта стала не затемнённой и сайтом стало можно пользоватся... Если повторно заходить на сайт не очищая данные браузера то потом уже проблема не повторяется и сайт работает нормально даже с включенным AdGuard, но после очистки данных браузера и при последующем заходе на сайт проблема повторяется снова... Воспроизведение по этому сценарию всегда стабильное... Москва взята только как пример и город по умолчанию на сайте наверное... А так эта проблема воспроизводится для карты любого города... Нужно бы наверное подправить что-то в каком-то из фильтров AdGuard... Заранее спасибо.

The AdGuard - Ads filter list in uBlock Origin prevents xhamster.com from loading, getting it stuck in a refresh loop. If have found that the following filter is causing the issue:\r\n`xhamster.com##+js(set-cookie-reload, ts_popunder, 1)`\r\nI have reset UBO to default settings (disabling the AdGuard list) and confirmed it works. I can also confirm that the issue does still exist with other extensions and my browser's built-in adblocker disabled. Using uBlock's logger, I was able find the above rule by individually bypassing each filtered element that was logged.\r\nInitially during testing, I was able to resolve the issue by bypassing this filter, which is from uBlock's default ad list: `xhamster.*##+js(set-cookie, ts_popunder, true, , reload, 1)`, however I ruled this one out since the site works OK when uBlock is only running on defaults. This is what led me to then find the rule I mentioned at the top of this comment, as it is the only other one that references cookie `ts_popunder`\r\nI have also confirmed that the issue persists when uBlock is running defaults with the AdGuard - Ads list enabled, and that the issue does not exist when other non-default lists and custom filters are enabled without the AdGuard list.\r\n\r\n2.

The AdGuard - Ads filter list in uBlock Origin prevents xhamster.com from loading, getting it stuck in a refresh loop. If have found that the following filter is causing the issue:\r\n`xhamster.com##+js(set-cookie-reload, ts_popunder, 1)`\r\nI have reset UBO to default settings (disabling the AdGuard list) and confirmed it works. I can also confirm that the issue does still exist with other extensions and my browser's built-in adblocker disabled. Using uBlock's logger, I was able find the above rule by individually bypassing each filtered element that was logged.\r\nInitially during testing, I was able to resolve the issue by bypassing this filter, which is from uBlock's default ad list: `xhamster.*##+js(set-cookie, ts_popunder, true, , reload, 1)`, however I ruled this one out since the site works OK when uBlock is only running on defaults. This is what led me to then find the rule I mentioned at the top of this comment, as it is the only other one that references cookie `ts_popunder`\r\nI have also confirmed that the issue persists when uBlock is running defaults with the AdGuard - Ads list enabled, and that the issue does not exist when other non-default lists and custom filters are enabled without the AdGuard list.\r\n\r\n2.

The AdGuard - Ads filter list in uBlock Origin prevents xhamster.com from loading, getting it stuck in a refresh loop. If have found that the following filter is causing the issue:\r\n`xhamster.com##+js(set-cookie-reload, ts_popunder, 1)`\r\nI have reset UBO to default settings (disabling the AdGuard list) and confirmed it works. I can also confirm that the issue does still exist with other extensions and my browser's built-in adblocker disabled. Using uBlock's logger, I was able find the above rule by individually bypassing each filtered element that was logged.\r\nInitially during testing, I was able to resolve the issue by bypassing this filter, which is from uBlock's default ad list: `xhamster.*##+js(set-cookie, ts_popunder, true, , reload, 1)`, however I ruled this one out since the site works OK when uBlock is only running on defaults. This is what led me to then find the rule I mentioned at the top of this comment, as it is the only other one that references cookie `ts_popunder`\r\nI have also confirmed that the issue persists when uBlock is running defaults with the AdGuard - Ads list enabled, and that the issue does not exist when other non-default lists and custom filters are enabled without the AdGuard list.\r\n\r\n2.
