ATTENTION\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\r\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \r\n\r\n> [!CAUTION] \r\n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n\r\n> [!CAUTION] \r\n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\r\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript.
