ATTENTION\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\r\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \r\n\r\n> [!CAUTION] \r\n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n\r\n> [!CAUTION] \r\n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\r\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript.

Comment\r\n> Problem is, that the LID mentioned above gets stripped from the URL, although geocaching.com is on AdGuard's Allow List.  Disabling AdGuard via the icon menu in the header does not make a difference neither. \r\n> \r\n> Only way to make the link work is to either disable the extension in Firefox' Extension Manager page, or disable the ``Legitimate URL Shortener`` in ``Filters`` => ``Privacy`` - which obviously gets applied although AdGuard is set to ``Off`` (via the Header icon) and although the site is on the Allow List - don't think that this is to be expected? But if, how can I get around this?\r\nUsername: `@MagpieFortyTwo`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/dyz5bxn0fy80g4gk848kcs8sw40gk48khbh8lszz9c.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bnow8ri8npc00wwg8gc4s4o884s0og4nzwx3rayfa8.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.48 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10 Pro\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Keine - der Test wurde in frischem Firefox-Profil mit nichts anderem als AdGuard AdBlocker ausgeführt.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/195907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/195907/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2577489239","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/195907#issuecomment-2577489239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/195907","id":2577489239,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86ZoV1X","user":{"login":"DandelionSprout","id":22780683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzgwNjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22780683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout","html_url":"https://github.com/DandelionSprout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-08T11:53:46Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T11:53:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'll add the proposed fix later today.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2577489239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-01-08T11:53:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I would like to clarify because the issue has been opened many times before about dizipal...\r\nDizipal is a platform that hosts movies and series from many online streaming platforms in Turkey. However, since the domain is constantly blocked by the country administration, they continue by moving to the next domain with adding next count.\r\n\r\nSo the system works like this;\r\n1) dizipal team buys dizipal1.com and starts live.\r\n2) The Republic of Turkey is blocking dizipal1.com via local DNS.\r\n3) dizipal team buys dizipal2.com and starts live.\r\n4) the republic of turkey...\r\n\r\nthis process is continued by increasing the number forever and ever.... So dizipal has been banned 840 times and continued with its next domain.
