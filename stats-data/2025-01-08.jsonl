ATTENTION\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\r\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \r\n\r\n> [!CAUTION] \r\n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\r\n\r\n> [!CAUTION] \r\n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\r\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript. ( [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing#264](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing/issues/264) )\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n> Please check that there no another web browser extension that has adblocking feature is enabled on your web browser.

Force to update the filters by clicking the reload button in AdGuard Browser Extension/AdGuard mobile or update tray menu in your system tray. [^2]\r\n2.
