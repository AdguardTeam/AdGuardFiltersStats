Plus, there are large white boxes left in the feed where the ads have been removed.\r\n> \r\n> I realize the empty white spaces might be hard to remove, but the text under the boxes of the pins would be nice to have back without the ads please as it describes the images. \r\n> \r\n> Cheers\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/0Akeyzs.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/kZ8ML3C.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.55\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149990/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1532918837","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149990#issuecomment-1532918837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149990","id":1532918837,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85bXnw1","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-03T12:12:55Z","updated_at":"2023-05-03T12:12:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">now the text under non-ad pins is being blocked\r\n\r\nThis text is hidden even with AdGuard disabled, so it looks like a website issue, at least on my end.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1532918837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-03T12:12:55Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Plus, there are large white boxes left in the feed where the ads have been removed.\r\n> \r\n> I realize the empty white spaces might be hard to remove, but the text under the boxes of the pins would be nice to have back without the ads please as it describes the images. \r\n> \r\n> Cheers\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/0Akeyzs.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/kZ8ML3C.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.55\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>EasyList Thailand, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149990/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1532914712","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149990#issuecomment-1532914712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/149990","id":1532914712,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85bXmwY","user":{"login":"jellizaveta","id":91964807,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXtFhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91964807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta","html_url":"https://github.com/jellizaveta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-03T12:09:21Z","updated_at":"2023-05-03T12:09:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think the issue may be caused by this rule:\r\n`pinterest.*#?#div > div[style] > div[data-grid-item=\"true\"]:has(> div div[data-test-pin-id] span:contains(/Promoted by|Promowane przez|Sponsorisée par|Рекламный пин|Рекламодатель|Gesponsord door|広告/))`\r\nBut I cannot reproduce such behavior of the page.  @AdamWr @Alex-302 @Sergey-Lyapin could you please take a look?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1532914712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-03T12:09:21Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
