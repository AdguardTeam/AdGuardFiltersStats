Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://online.sberbank.ru/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fonline.sberbank.ru%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Официальное мобильное приложение СберБанка для Сбербанк Online для Android.  Версия актуальная текущая 15.12.0. Приложение скачано и установлено и обновляется не из какого-то магазина приложений а в виде apk-файла непосредственно с сайта банка. Если AdGuard включен то в настройках в приложении банка в разделе настроек Оформление->Заставки на входе полностью или частично не загружается графика, невозможно выбрать и установить другой набор заставок отличный от того что уже до этого был установлен по умолчанию или выбран пользователем. Наглядно на скриншотах. А если зайти ещё чуть глубже в настройки, т.е. попытаться выбрать конкретный набор заставок чтобы его установить, то там вообще белый экран будет, т.е. не будет показана графика этого набора заставок и не будет кнопки для его загрузки и установки. Если AdGuard временно выключить то всё в этом плане в приложении Сбербанка загружается и работает нормально.\r\nUsername: `@NUser2018`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2rm5ucnk9omcoosc48ksgk0w88w8ww47afuvkoauq0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/gon2kglnbfkgw0cgo0sc44o8k4o4k4on8i4568epz4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.6.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Официальное мобильное приложение СберБанка\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.google/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2328415151","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186217#issuecomment-2328415151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/186217","id":2328415151,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86KyMuv","user":{"login":"NUser2018","id":43743908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQzOTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43743908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018","html_url":"https://github.com/NUser2018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NUser2018/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-04T09:51:58Z","updated_at":"2024-09-04T09:51:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Sergey-Lyapin и @zloyden Проверил.

Т.е. убрать новое правило и вернуть и оставить только старое.\r\n\r\nК сожалению насколько я вижу в AdGuard для Android в отличии от Adguard для Windows не возможности открыть продвинутый редактор фильтров где при необходимости можно в том числе найти и отключить точечно только конкретное правило в нужном фильтре (это кстати можно рассматривать как один из недостатков Adguard для Android и как замечание и пожелание по улучшению функционала Adguard VPN для Android здесь в этом плане до уровня Adguard для Windows)...\r\n\r\nМожет быть тогда можно добавить что-то ещё временно для теста для проверки в пользовательские правила чтобы новое правило из русского фильтра игнорировалось и действовало соответственно только старое правило добавленное вручную в пользовательские правила?\r\n\r\nПишите, обязательно помогу проверить на своей стороне и напишу здесь результат.\r\n\r\nВообщем я решительно склоняюсь к тому что нужно попробовать вернуть только старое правило убрав новое правило.\r\nТогда ведь недавно везде появилось пустое место но хотя бы полезный функционал сайта при этом нигде не был сломан.\r\nА Вам виднее можно ли это как-то сделать точечно предварительно вручную для проверки до внесения новых изменений непосредственно в обновления фильтров штатно для всех или нет. Подскажите.\r\nИзвините что так как-то странно и сложно получается в этот раз что даже по разному на разных аккаунтах. MAIL.RU совсем всё усложнили со своей рекламой получается, раз по разному на разных аккаунтах теперь. :(\r\n\r\n**На данный момент актуальная ситуация такова:**\r\n_Аккаунт-1:_\r\nБез второго старого правила: не отображается блок для очистки Корзины, на месте него белое пустое место. Письма не срезаются.\r\n\r\nВместе со вторым старым правилом: есть лишние пустые места, блок для очистки корзины не отображается.\r\n\r\n_Аккаунт-2:_\r\nБез второго старого правила: срезается одно верхнее письмо. Блок для очистки корзины виден только чуть-чуть частично.\r\n\r\nВместе со вторым старым правилом: и список писем и Корзина отображаются и работают нормально, лишних пустых мест нет.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2328384385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-09-04T09:37:09Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Hello.\r\n> \r\n> First of all, I would like to inform you that in order to send this application, I had to switch from the alpha version of the Adguard application for Windows to the stable version, because in the alpha version the application form does not detect any settings of my program.\r\n> \r\n> The above report concerns Disney+, namely the VOD platform, when Adguard is active it takes a very long time to load even though according to the browser the page is already loaded.\r\n> \r\n> This makes it quite difficult to use the VOD service on your computer\r\n> \r\n> Additionally, I will add that I checked whether this is caused by one of the blocking lists I use and I can confirm with full confidence that this is not the case, and the website only starts working properly when the entire Windows application is suspended. disabling filtering from the assistant plugin has no effect.\r\nUsername: `@grzenio22`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n

Comment\r\n> Hello.\r\n> \r\n> First of all, I would like to inform you that in order to send this application, I had to switch from the alpha version of the Adguard application for Windows to the stable version, because in the alpha version the application form does not detect any settings of my program.\r\n> \r\n> The above report concerns Disney+, namely the VOD platform, when Adguard is active it takes a very long time to load even though according to the browser the page is already loaded.\r\n> \r\n> This makes it quite difficult to use the VOD service on your computer\r\n> \r\n> Additionally, I will add that I checked whether this is caused by one of the blocking lists I use and I can confirm with full confidence that this is not the case, and the website only starts working properly when the entire Windows application is suspended. disabling filtering from the assistant plugin has no effect.\r\nUsername: `@grzenio22`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n
