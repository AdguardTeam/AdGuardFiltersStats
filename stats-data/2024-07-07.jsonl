Esto es algo que no me gusta y que me molesta!\r\n> \r\n> El otro no es tanto el del cuadro, pero aparece.

Проблема с данным сайтом, при включении любой серии с включенным Adguard произведение дорожки идёт с микро-фризами (ощущение что реклама пытается пролезть, периодически экран чернеет, потом картинка идет 1-2 секунды, далее опять останавливается и т.п.) Стоит поставить Adguard на паузу , обновить страницу, просмотреть рекламу - и загрузка видео идёт адекватно без лагов. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/iho1jwrqrhkogo040osgkkog84048gwh0y0fjrgojk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2swi7ax4elmogc0oo0kcoskwkow8kw4nh7jiebxpio.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.4\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Яндекс Браузер\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | Adguard Extra\r\nOther extensions used: | Не установлены","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/183109/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-07T15:18:54Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
