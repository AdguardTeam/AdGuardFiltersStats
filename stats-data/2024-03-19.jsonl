They're also used for other tracking purposes (such as the one in the example URL of this pull request).\r\n\r\nI don't know if `source_ve_path` could be considered as tracking. But, given that it is not necessary for the video to play in the user's browser, it might be worth adding too.\r\n\r\n2.

Your comment\r\n\r\nThis pull requests adds more filters for the YouTube site.\r\nSpecifically, the goal is to remove tracking parameters from URLs.\r\nI've also extended the current filters to include the other YouTube sites.\r\n\r\n`embeds_widget_referrer` is an extension to the current one (`embeds_referring_euri`).\r\n`feature` and `si` are used when sharing YouTube links to track which person sent it. They're also used for other tracking purposes (such as the one in the example URL of this pull request).\r\n\r\nI don't know if `source_ve_path` could be considered as tracking. But, given that it is not necessary for the video to play in the user's browser, it might be worth adding too.\r\n\r\n2.

comment and screenshots\r\n\r\n1. Your comment\r\n\r\nThis pull requests adds more filters for the YouTube site.\r\nSpecifically, the goal is to remove tracking parameters from URLs.\r\nI've also extended the current filters to include the other YouTube sites.\r\n\r\n`embeds_widget_referrer` is an extension to the current one (`embeds_referring_euri`).\r\n`feature` and `si` are used when sharing YouTube links to track which person sent it. They're also used for other tracking purposes (such as the one in the example URL of this pull request).\r\n\r\nI don't know if `source_ve_path` could be considered as tracking. But, given that it is not necessary for the video to play in the user's browser, it might be worth adding too.\r\n\r\n2.

They're also used for other tracking purposes (such as the one in the example URL of this pull request).\r\n\r\nI don't know if `source_ve_path` could be considered as tracking. But, given that it is not necessary for the video to play in the user's browser, it might be worth adding too.\r\n\r\n2.

changing as +1, if it does not open, try 201 or 202. The site contains banner ads and pre-roll ads. It is simple to block them, but what I want to ask is that when I block the pre-roll ad video with the `inattvhd200.xyz###video-before` filter, when I click on it to open another match broadcast from the right side, the warning to wait for the ad to end appears. What kind of filter can be used to prevent this?\r\nUsername: `@punisher018`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pb7gtfo3m8gckkwgk8cw0ogg00c00go4fx6p15ez9y.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.13\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880)\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdBlockID","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175056/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-19T16:53:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

changing as +1, if it does not open, try 201 or 202. The site contains banner ads and pre-roll ads. It is simple to block them, but what I want to ask is that when I block the pre-roll ad video with the `inattvhd200.xyz###video-before` filter, when I click on it to open another match broadcast from the right side, the warning to wait for the ad to end appears. What kind of filter can be used to prevent this?\r\nUsername: `@punisher018`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pb7gtfo3m8gckkwgk8cw0ogg00c00go4fx6p15ez9y.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.13\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880)\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdBlockID","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175056/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2008118257","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175056#issuecomment-2008118257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175056","id":2008118257,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM853sXPx","user":{"login":"punisher018","id":51531027,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNTMxMDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51531027?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/punisher018","html_url":"https://github.com/punisher018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punisher018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punisher018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punisher018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punisher018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punisher018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punisher018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punisher018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punisher018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punisher018/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-19T20:55:26Z","updated_at":"2024-03-19T20:55:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The problem still exists.
