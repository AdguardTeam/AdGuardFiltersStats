\"ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS\". Ссылки без трекинга (без мусора после \".html\"). В хроме \"напрямую\" открываются без проблем. В хром-интеграции в ТГ идёт редирект-петля. Модуль антитрекинга пробовал отключать, но это не помогает. \r\n\r\nПохоже, дело действительно в AdGuard, но не в антитрекинге. По крайней мере не в самой функции. В режиме интеграции браузера adguard'ом срезаются куки и вероятно из-за наличия реферера телеграма (а мб и ещё почему) антиспам система озона и али считает, что ссылку открывает бот и постоянно редиректит на страницу для выдачи кук а т.к. куки срезаются всё уходит в петлю. Если отключить для озона антитрекинг через правило\r\n\r\n>@@||ozon.ru^$stealth\r\n\r\nто во \"встроенном браузере\" телеграма озон открывается без заморочек. Походу дело всё-таки в антитрекинге, но не в том, что включается отдельной функцией, а в том, что работает через фильтры. Или это один и тот же механизм ? Но почему тогда отключение функции не даёт эффекта ? Какое будет более корректное правило, что позволит минимизировать утечки ? Пробовал перебирать стелс-опции вплоть до использования\r\n\r\n>@@||ozon.ru^$stealth=searchqueries|donottrack|3p-cookie|1p-cookie|3p-cache|3p-auth|webrtc|push|location|flash|java|referrer|useragent|ip|xclientdata|dpi\r\n\r\nно петлевой редирект остаётся.\r\n\r\n3.

AdGuard стало блокироватся содержимое раздела каталога услуг, список категорий услуг доступных для подключения, в Личном кабинете Мегафон (ссылка на Личный кабинет https://lk.megafon.ru/) (ссылка на конкретный раздел Личного кабинета ( https://lk.megafon.ru/options/categories ) Как в мобильном приложении (версия мобильного приложения актуальная последняя 4.56.0, скачано с официального сайта Мегафон (со страницы https://moscow.megafon.ru/help/lk/ ) в виде apk-файла, но это приложение есть также в разных магазинах приложений, но в Google Play его давно уже нет по понятным причинам) так и в веб-версии Личного кабинета Мегафон через браузер. Причем проблема воспроизводится и при переключении браузера в режим принудительного просмотра страниц в режиме для ПК, так что хотя непосредственно с ПК на Windows я не проверял пока, но скорее всего соответственно проблема затрагивает и ПК, поэтому и фикс нужен не только для Adguard для Android но и общий с Adguard для Windows. Проблему обнаружил вчера вечером перед сном, до недавнего времени такого точно не было, хотя и не факт что появилось вчера а не на днях. Проблема очень критичная и наверняка затрагивает очень много пользователей AdGuard, поскольку и пользователей у AdGuard и клиентов у Мегафона очень много, и требует фикса как можно скорее.\r\nUsername: `@NUser2018`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/h5d5yililigogg4gs4kw4w44gsw8ckc15u6vp4z5ph.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/afybe4o2ahkck4s8880408g4scwwkooqvx1hdrca6o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/sm9hhe1h9msksog0s44ww84k48gsgs8tu6w5fpjmxw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jpo8iqwt81csc800sowog8gsow0w8wws79t17erxqs.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.6.2\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.google/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/187988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/187988/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2337652276","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/187988#issuecomment-2337652276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/187988","id":2337652276,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86LVb40","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-09T09:49:23Z","updated_at":"2024-09-09T09:49:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"С ДНС выборочно не разблокировать.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2337652276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-09-09T09:49:25Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
