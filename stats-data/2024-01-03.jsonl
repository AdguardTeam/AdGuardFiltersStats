They usually embed Youtube videos.\r\n> -  The news (main) page doesn't load. Keep getting the \"Couldn't fetch news. Please try again\" error (screenshot). If I click on \"Try Again\" link 3-7 times, it eventually load even with AdGuard enabled.\r\n> -  This app also has an embedded browser shows news articles from news sources.

This app used to work properly.

They usually embed Youtube videos.\r\n> -  The news (main) page doesn't load. Keep getting the \"Couldn't fetch news. Please try again\" error (screenshot). If I click on \"Try Again\" link 3-7 times, it eventually load even with AdGuard enabled.\r\n> -  This app also has an embedded browser shows news articles from news sources. That also doesn't load properly.\r\nUsername: `@shriganesh`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/r4imwuw9xes4wscs4koowosks4coowex6o0f4yi40s.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/gqysc4balgggs8s80wo08csgg8gs8scg7e7eze1z08.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.3.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 13, Android 14\r\nBrowser: | It's an app, not a browser.\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Cloudflare`, `DoH`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | No other adblockers or antivirus were installed in the phones","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169405/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1874896234","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169405#issuecomment-1874896234","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169405","id":1874896234,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85vwKVq","user":{"login":"BlazDT","id":34266271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjY2Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34266271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT","html_url":"https://github.com/BlazDT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-03T06:18:59Z","updated_at":"2024-01-03T06:18:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"On apps you can only block/unblock requests and if the website's API is only trusting a specific certificate (or issuer) there is nothing which can be done\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1874896234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-03T06:19:01Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

However each time the reference number is different.  I rely on Sainsburys for my grocery delivery as I am unable to get out much and do not drive.  Any idea how to fix this problem.  Which I hadn't downloaded the latest Adguard version, but have no idea how to go back to the one I had before. \r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/1a0n44s1k4v4oww0ggck80owwos4soc8ascqo6liqg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/h3dnav9s4z4soocww8o0gsocss04ssk478vlsv0ct8.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.13.0.1558 release\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js)\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/gb/groceries?src=ppc&utm_campaign=11152510788&utm_medium=cpc&utm_custom2=127-581-3848&storeId=10151&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIksOCrsaygwMVA5pQBh32uQjMEAAYASAAEgImm_D_BwE&utm_custom1=107686196805&langId=44&utm_source=Google&utm_content=text&krypto=CoQDPgX3fsdDOxOh%2BKggpZ6L%2FihleBox%2B4NNCdhUZ1BpwjhdRdczZNpBpu0uxuaqgrnWHtEJgN%2BjIZQ0c4Yg1KOt7CEAhvh9qgnWZewtwlhOXsm%2BXF516VwOF%2FDiMLIHrUzZWBahePk0XqGY9OX5FhBSv7gMTjyadMFc%2FaLQrV3jH5yF5nz8rFhL2oQ3coHLBPaHJN%2BzR%2B8ewlTscTVz08koofLIvfURw2K%2FRs%2F47Im7O2BgJqMX65Qbq2ADfSHq&ddkey=https%3Agb%2Fgroceries](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sainsburys.co.uk%2Fwebapp%2Fwcs%2Fstores%2Fservlet%2Fgb%2Fgroceries%3Fsrc%3Dppc%26utm_campaign%3D11152510788%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_custom2%3D127-581-3848%26storeId%3D10151%26gclid%3DEAIaIQobChMIksOCrsaygwMVA5pQBh32uQjMEAAYASAAEgImm_D_BwE%26utm_custom1%3D107686196805%26langId%3D44%26utm_source%3DGoogle%26utm_content%3Dtext%26krypto%3DCoQDPgX3fsdDOxOh%252BKggpZ6L%252FihleBox%252B4NNCdhUZ1BpwjhdRdczZNpBpu0uxuaqgrnWHtEJgN%252BjIZQ0c4Yg1KOt7CEAhvh9qgnWZewtwlhOXsm%252BXF516VwOF%252FDiMLIHrUzZWBahePk0XqGY9OX5FhBSv7gMTjyadMFc%252FaLQrV3jH5yF5nz8rFhL2oQ3coHLBPaHJN%252BzR%252B8ewlTscTVz08koofLIvfURw2K%252FRs%252F47Im7O2BgJqMX65Qbq2ADfSHq%26ddkey%3Dhttps%253Agb%252Fgroceries)\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169595/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1875112605","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169595#issuecomment-1875112605","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169595","id":1875112605,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85vw_Kd","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-03T10:02:29Z","updated_at":"2024-01-03T10:02:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has been open for 4 days with no activity.\nUnfortunately, our resources are limited and we can not always take the time to respond to requests about websites that are not popular enough.

However each time the reference number is different.  I rely on Sainsburys for my grocery delivery as I am unable to get out much and do not drive.  Any idea how to fix this problem.

Comment\r\n> I updated Adguard to the latest version two days ago - 2.13.0.1558.  Since then I cannot access Sainsbury's online grocery shop web page at all unless I disable Adguard.  The message I keep getting is Access Denied\r\n> \r\n> You don't have permission to access \"http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/favourites-as-list\" on this server.\r\n> Reference #18.9d421202.1703928832.4a2b5c2b.  However each time the reference number is different.  I rely on Sainsburys for my grocery delivery as I am unable to get out much and do not drive.  Any idea how to fix this problem.  Which I hadn't downloaded the latest Adguard version, but have no idea how to go back to the one I had before. \r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/1a0n44s1k4v4oww0ggck80owwos4soc8ascqo6liqg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/h3dnav9s4z4soocww8o0gsocss04ssk478vlsv0ct8.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.13.0.1558 release\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js)\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/gb/groceries?src=ppc&utm_campaign=11152510788&utm_medium=cpc&utm_custom2=127-581-3848&storeId=10151&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIksOCrsaygwMVA5pQBh32uQjMEAAYASAAEgImm_D_BwE&utm_custom1=107686196805&langId=44&utm_source=Google&utm_content=text&krypto=CoQDPgX3fsdDOxOh%2BKggpZ6L%2FihleBox%2B4NNCdhUZ1BpwjhdRdczZNpBpu0uxuaqgrnWHtEJgN%2BjIZQ0c4Yg1KOt7CEAhvh9qgnWZewtwlhOXsm%2BXF516VwOF%2FDiMLIHrUzZWBahePk0XqGY9OX5FhBSv7gMTjyadMFc%2FaLQrV3jH5yF5nz8rFhL2oQ3coHLBPaHJN%2BzR%2B8ewlTscTVz08koofLIvfURw2K%2FRs%2F47Im7O2BgJqMX65Qbq2ADfSHq&ddkey=https%3Agb%2Fgroceries](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sainsburys.co.uk%2Fwebapp%2Fwcs%2Fstores%2Fservlet%2Fgb%2Fgroceries%3Fsrc%3Dppc%26utm_campaign%3D11152510788%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_custom2%3D127-581-3848%26storeId%3D10151%26gclid%3DEAIaIQobChMIksOCrsaygwMVA5pQBh32uQjMEAAYASAAEgImm_D_BwE%26utm_custom1%3D107686196805%26langId%3D44%26utm_source%3DGoogle%26utm_content%3Dtext%26krypto%3DCoQDPgX3fsdDOxOh%252BKggpZ6L%252FihleBox%252B4NNCdhUZ1BpwjhdRdczZNpBpu0uxuaqgrnWHtEJgN%252BjIZQ0c4Yg1KOt7CEAhvh9qgnWZewtwlhOXsm%252BXF516VwOF%252FDiMLIHrUzZWBahePk0XqGY9OX5FhBSv7gMTjyadMFc%252FaLQrV3jH5yF5nz8rFhL2oQ3coHLBPaHJN%252BzR%252B8ewlTscTVz08koofLIvfURw2K%252FRs%252F47Im7O2BgJqMX65Qbq2ADfSHq%26ddkey%3Dhttps%253Agb%252Fgroceries)\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169595/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-03T10:28:29Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
