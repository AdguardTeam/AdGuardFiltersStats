They usually embed Youtube videos.\r\n> -  The news (main) page doesn't load. Keep getting the \"Couldn't fetch news. Please try again\" error (screenshot). If I click on \"Try Again\" link 3-7 times, it eventually load even with AdGuard enabled.\r\n> -  This app also has an embedded browser shows news articles from news sources.

This app used to work properly.

They usually embed Youtube videos.\r\n> -  The news (main) page doesn't load. Keep getting the \"Couldn't fetch news. Please try again\" error (screenshot). If I click on \"Try Again\" link 3-7 times, it eventually load even with AdGuard enabled.\r\n> -  This app also has an embedded browser shows news articles from news sources. That also doesn't load properly.\r\nUsername: `@shriganesh`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/r4imwuw9xes4wscs4koowosks4coowex6o0f4yi40s.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/gqysc4balgggs8s80wo08csgg8gs8scg7e7eze1z08.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.3.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 13, Android 14\r\nBrowser: | It's an app, not a browser.\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Cloudflare`, `DoH`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | No other adblockers or antivirus were installed in the phones","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169405/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1874896234","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169405#issuecomment-1874896234","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169405","id":1874896234,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85vwKVq","user":{"login":"BlazDT","id":34266271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjY2Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34266271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT","html_url":"https://github.com/BlazDT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-03T06:18:59Z","updated_at":"2024-01-03T06:18:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"On apps you can only block/unblock requests and if the website's API is only trusting a specific certificate (or issuer) there is nothing which can be done\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1874896234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-03T06:19:01Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
