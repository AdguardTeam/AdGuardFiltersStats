They usually embed Youtube videos.\r\n> -  The news (main) page doesn't load. Keep getting the \"Couldn't fetch news. Please try again\" error (screenshot). If I click on \"Try Again\" link 3-7 times, it eventually load even with AdGuard enabled.\r\n> -  This app also has an embedded browser shows news articles from news sources.

This app used to work properly.

They usually embed Youtube videos.\r\n> -  The news (main) page doesn't load. Keep getting the \"Couldn't fetch news. Please try again\" error (screenshot). If I click on \"Try Again\" link 3-7 times, it eventually load even with AdGuard enabled.\r\n> -  This app also has an embedded browser shows news articles from news sources. That also doesn't load properly.\r\nUsername: `@shriganesh`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/r4imwuw9xes4wscs4koowosks4coowex6o0f4yi40s.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/gqysc4balgggs8s80wo08csgg8gs8scg7e7eze1z08.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.3.1\r\nSystem version: | Android 13, Android 14\r\nBrowser: | It's an app, not a browser.\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Cloudflare`, `DoH`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | No other adblockers or antivirus were installed in the phones","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169405/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1874896234","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169405#issuecomment-1874896234","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169405","id":1874896234,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85vwKVq","user":{"login":"BlazDT","id":34266271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjY2Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34266271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT","html_url":"https://github.com/BlazDT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-03T06:18:59Z","updated_at":"2024-01-03T06:18:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"On apps you can only block/unblock requests and if the website's API is only trusting a specific certificate (or issuer) there is nothing which can be done\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1874896234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-03T06:19:01Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

However each time the reference number is different.  I rely on Sainsburys for my grocery delivery as I am unable to get out much and do not drive.  Any idea how to fix this problem.  Which I hadn't downloaded the latest Adguard version, but have no idea how to go back to the one I had before. \r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/1a0n44s1k4v4oww0ggck80owwos4soc8ascqo6liqg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/h3dnav9s4z4soocww8o0gsocss04ssk478vlsv0ct8.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.13.0.1558 release\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js)\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/gb/groceries?src=ppc&utm_campaign=11152510788&utm_medium=cpc&utm_custom2=127-581-3848&storeId=10151&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIksOCrsaygwMVA5pQBh32uQjMEAAYASAAEgImm_D_BwE&utm_custom1=107686196805&langId=44&utm_source=Google&utm_content=text&krypto=CoQDPgX3fsdDOxOh%2BKggpZ6L%2FihleBox%2B4NNCdhUZ1BpwjhdRdczZNpBpu0uxuaqgrnWHtEJgN%2BjIZQ0c4Yg1KOt7CEAhvh9qgnWZewtwlhOXsm%2BXF516VwOF%2FDiMLIHrUzZWBahePk0XqGY9OX5FhBSv7gMTjyadMFc%2FaLQrV3jH5yF5nz8rFhL2oQ3coHLBPaHJN%2BzR%2B8ewlTscTVz08koofLIvfURw2K%2FRs%2F47Im7O2BgJqMX65Qbq2ADfSHq&ddkey=https%3Agb%2Fgroceries](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sainsburys.co.uk%2Fwebapp%2Fwcs%2Fstores%2Fservlet%2Fgb%2Fgroceries%3Fsrc%3Dppc%26utm_campaign%3D11152510788%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_custom2%3D127-581-3848%26storeId%3D10151%26gclid%3DEAIaIQobChMIksOCrsaygwMVA5pQBh32uQjMEAAYASAAEgImm_D_BwE%26utm_custom1%3D107686196805%26langId%3D44%26utm_source%3DGoogle%26utm_content%3Dtext%26krypto%3DCoQDPgX3fsdDOxOh%252BKggpZ6L%252FihleBox%252B4NNCdhUZ1BpwjhdRdczZNpBpu0uxuaqgrnWHtEJgN%252BjIZQ0c4Yg1KOt7CEAhvh9qgnWZewtwlhOXsm%252BXF516VwOF%252FDiMLIHrUzZWBahePk0XqGY9OX5FhBSv7gMTjyadMFc%252FaLQrV3jH5yF5nz8rFhL2oQ3coHLBPaHJN%252BzR%252B8ewlTscTVz08koofLIvfURw2K%252FRs%252F47Im7O2BgJqMX65Qbq2ADfSHq%26ddkey%3Dhttps%253Agb%252Fgroceries)\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169595/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1875112605","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169595#issuecomment-1875112605","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169595","id":1875112605,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85vw_Kd","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-03T10:02:29Z","updated_at":"2024-01-03T10:02:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has been open for 4 days with no activity.\nUnfortunately, our resources are limited and we can not always take the time to respond to requests about websites that are not popular enough.
