Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://wogaa.sg/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwogaa.sg%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> WOGAA.sg is Singapore's government website to host some of Singapore's government services. I was having trouble making payment for a government related service because fetching a Javascript from the domain came with an error. On browser webpage inspection, the GET function threw a ERR_ADDRESS_INVALID error, and I double checked the main site domain with all my browsers it also came with the same error. On troubleshooting with a proxy server, the website showed up again. I believe AdGuard either has wrongly blocked this domain and should be marked as safe or the domain is not found on its domain name server list.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bixem6cs8wococwwco0wwc4sswkocgsg7te8ycz2rs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tvnvcwsy4gg8wg8g0wwkg40kg0o4og4h8k75qsbre8.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | AdGuard DNS\r\nBrowser: | All browsers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163255/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1750388500","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163255#issuecomment-1750388500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/163255","id":1750388500,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85oVM8U","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-06T10:40:53Z","updated_at":"2023-10-06T10:40:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ryanbr Please take a look.
