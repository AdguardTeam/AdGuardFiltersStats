However, a new version of GoatRAT functions as a Banking Trojan, specifically aimed at Brazilian banks.\r\n\r\nLike other types of Banking Trojans, GoatRAT utilizes the Accessibility service to implement an Automatic Transfer System (ATS) framework, which enables the transfer of money from the victim’s account using the PIX key. The PIX key is used to perform the instant payment. This malware currently targets three Brazilian banks: NUBank, Banco Inter, and PagBank.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40774281/226697704-8d3874d2-43e6-4dbb-a8bb-5796352dccbf.png)\r\n\r\nURL source: https://blog.cyble.com/2023/03/14/goatrat-android-banking-trojan-variant-targeting-brazilian-banks/\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nBlock URL's:\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n<!--StartFragment-->\r\n\r\nURL | Description\r\n-- | -- \r\nhxxps://bit[.]ly/nubankmodulo | Shortened malware distribution URL\r\nhxxps://goatrat[.]com/apks/apk20.apk | Malware distribution URL\r\nhxxp://api.goatrat[.]com:3008 | C&C server to receive PIX key\r\n\r\n<!--EndFragment-->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1479041573","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175#issuecomment-1479041573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175","id":1479041573,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85YKGIl","user":{"login":"DandelionSprout","id":22780683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzgwNjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22780683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout","html_url":"https://github.com/DandelionSprout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-22T07:36:14Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T07:36:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I propose:\r\n```\r\n||goatrat.com^$all\r\n||bit.ly/nubankmodulo^$all\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1479041573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-22T07:36:15Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @misc-activities\r\n> In the Walmart login page (see 0.png), I entered my email address and clicked on the Continue button. It opened a message box trying to show me a \"Press and Hold\" type CAPTCHA but the CAPTCHA didn't load. This can be seen in 1.png. So, I clicked on \"Try a different method\" in the message box. When I did that, it showed me a picture identification type CAPTCHA (see 2.png). When I completed the CAPTCHA verification, instead of asking me for the password, it went back to the page where it was asking for my email address and showed a message saying, \"Something went wrong, please try again.\" This can be seen in 3.png.\r\n> \r\n> I closed the AdGuard app and tried and I was able to login successfully. I also tried with Stealth Mode disabled but that didn't work.\r\n> \r\n> I'm having this issue in Safari as well.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/EevidNP.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/HE5788c.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/qwCTkAZ.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://reports-img.adguard.com/fyb5z94.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.9.2.1234+release\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (), <br>Hide your User-Agent (), <br>Hide your IP address ()\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant and AdGuard Extra","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1479488977","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063#issuecomment-1479488977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063","id":1479488977,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85YLzXR","user":{"login":"misc-activities","id":51946231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTQ2MjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51946231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities","html_url":"https://github.com/misc-activities","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misc-activities/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-22T12:29:26Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T12:29:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've emailed you the credentials.

However, a new version of GoatRAT functions as a Banking Trojan, specifically aimed at Brazilian banks.\r\n\r\nLike other types of Banking Trojans, GoatRAT utilizes the Accessibility service to implement an Automatic Transfer System (ATS) framework, which enables the transfer of money from the victim’s account using the PIX key. The PIX key is used to perform the instant payment. This malware currently targets three Brazilian banks: NUBank, Banco Inter, and PagBank.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40774281/226697704-8d3874d2-43e6-4dbb-a8bb-5796352dccbf.png)\r\n\r\nURL source: https://blog.cyble.com/2023/03/14/goatrat-android-banking-trojan-variant-targeting-brazilian-banks/\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nBlock URL's:\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n<!--StartFragment-->\r\n\r\nURL | Description\r\n-- | -- \r\nhxxps://bit[.]ly/nubankmodulo | Shortened malware distribution URL\r\nhxxps://goatrat[.]com/apks/apk20.apk | Malware distribution URL\r\nhxxp://api.goatrat[.]com:3008 | C&C server to receive PIX key\r\n\r\n<!--EndFragment-->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1479471460","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175#issuecomment-1479471460","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175","id":1479471460,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85YLvFk","user":{"login":"krystian3w","id":35370833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzcwODMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35370833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w","html_url":"https://github.com/krystian3w","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krystian3w/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-22T12:15:15Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T12:15:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"But same for  Goot loader and Cobalt?\r\n\r\nSome may disable the malware protection function like disabling Google Badware Risk or Microsoft SmartScreen.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1479471460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-22T12:15:15Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

However, a new version of GoatRAT functions as a Banking Trojan, specifically aimed at Brazilian banks.\r\n\r\nLike other types of Banking Trojans, GoatRAT utilizes the Accessibility service to implement an Automatic Transfer System (ATS) framework, which enables the transfer of money from the victim’s account using the PIX key. The PIX key is used to perform the instant payment. This malware currently targets three Brazilian banks: NUBank, Banco Inter, and PagBank.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40774281/226697704-8d3874d2-43e6-4dbb-a8bb-5796352dccbf.png)\r\n\r\nURL source: https://blog.cyble.com/2023/03/14/goatrat-android-banking-trojan-variant-targeting-brazilian-banks/\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nBlock URL's:\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n<!--StartFragment-->\r\n\r\nURL | Description\r\n-- | -- \r\nhxxps://bit[.]ly/nubankmodulo | Shortened malware distribution URL\r\nhxxps://goatrat[.]com/apks/apk20.apk | Malware distribution URL\r\nhxxp://api.goatrat[.]com:3008 | C&C server to receive PIX key\r\n\r\n<!--EndFragment-->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1479465338","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175#issuecomment-1479465338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175","id":1479465338,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85YLtl6","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-22T12:10:15Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T12:10:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It is blocked by AdGuard browsing security module.\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersRegistry/issues/763#issuecomment-1479460865","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1479465338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-22T12:10:16Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @misc-activities\r\n> In the Walmart login page (see 0.png), I entered my email address and clicked on the Continue button. It opened a message box trying to show me a \"Press and Hold\" type CAPTCHA but the CAPTCHA didn't load. This can be seen in 1.png. So, I clicked on \"Try a different method\" in the message box. When I did that, it showed me a picture identification type CAPTCHA (see 2.png). When I completed the CAPTCHA verification, instead of asking me for the password, it went back to the page where it was asking for my email address and showed a message saying, \"Something went wrong, please try again.\" This can be seen in 3.png.\r\n> \r\n> I closed the AdGuard app and tried and I was able to login successfully. I also tried with Stealth Mode disabled but that didn't work.\r\n> \r\n> I'm having this issue in Safari as well.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/EevidNP.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/HE5788c.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/qwCTkAZ.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://reports-img.adguard.com/fyb5z94.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.9.2.1234+release\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (), <br>Hide your User-Agent (), <br>Hide your IP address ()\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant and AdGuard Extra","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1479583586","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063#issuecomment-1479583586","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146063","id":1479583586,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85YMKdi","user":{"login":"jellizaveta","id":91964807,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXtFhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91964807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta","html_url":"https://github.com/jellizaveta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-22T13:38:45Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T13:38:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Unfortunately, I didn't get it, checked in spam too.

However, a new version of GoatRAT functions as a Banking Trojan, specifically aimed at Brazilian banks.\r\n\r\nLike other types of Banking Trojans, GoatRAT utilizes the Accessibility service to implement an Automatic Transfer System (ATS) framework, which enables the transfer of money from the victim’s account using the PIX key.

However, a new version of GoatRAT functions as a Banking Trojan, specifically aimed at Brazilian banks.\r\n\r\nLike other types of Banking Trojans, GoatRAT utilizes the Accessibility service to implement an Automatic Transfer System (ATS) framework, which enables the transfer of money from the victim’s account using the PIX key. The PIX key is used to perform the instant payment. This malware currently targets three Brazilian banks: NUBank, Banco Inter, and PagBank.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40774281/226697704-8d3874d2-43e6-4dbb-a8bb-5796352dccbf.png)\r\n\r\nURL source: https://blog.cyble.com/2023/03/14/goatrat-android-banking-trojan-variant-targeting-brazilian-banks/\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nBlock URL's:\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n<!--StartFragment-->\r\n\r\nURL | Description\r\n-- | -- \r\nhxxps://bit[.]ly/nubankmodulo | Shortened malware distribution URL\r\nhxxps://goatrat[.]com/apks/apk20.apk | Malware distribution URL\r\nhxxp://api.goatrat[.]com:3008 | C&C server to receive PIX key\r\n\r\n<!--EndFragment-->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1479663379","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175#issuecomment-1479663379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175","id":1479663379,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85YMd8T","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-22T14:26:51Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T14:26:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As I said [here](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersRegistry/issues/763#issuecomment-1479460865), it's already blocked by [our browsing security](https://reports.adguard.com/en/goatrat.com/report.html).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1479663379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-22T14:26:51Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

READ THIS CAREFULLY**\r\n\r\nI found a link cutting service that collects too much personal information.\r\n\r\n[Here is a screenshot with

Comment\r\nUsername: @misc-activities\r\n> In the Walmart login page (see 0.png), I entered my email address and clicked on the Continue button. It opened a message box trying to show me a \"Press and Hold\" type CAPTCHA but the CAPTCHA didn't load. This can be seen in 1.png. So, I clicked on \"Try a different method\" in the message box. When I did that, it showed me a picture identification type CAPTCHA (see 2.png). When I completed the CAPTCHA verification, instead of asking me for the password, it went back to the page where it was asking for my email address and showed a message saying, \"Something went wrong, please try again.\" This can be seen in 3.png.\r\n> \r\n> I closed the AdGuard app and tried and I was able to login successfully.

Comment\r\nUsername: @misc-activities\r\n> In the Walmart login page (see 0.png), I entered my email address and clicked on the Continue button. It opened a message box trying to show me a \"Press and Hold\" type CAPTCHA but the CAPTCHA didn't load. This can be seen in 1.png. So, I clicked on \"Try a different method\" in the message box.

Comment\r\nUsername: @quaybj\r\n> This food ordering site has the option to get weekly discounts.  The link to the promotion number and the discounted list does not work with adguard installed on my machines (MAC and PC). I have Chrome, Firefox, and Brave.  That particular URL is blocked for all of them.  I am using https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query in my router DNS setting.  Disabling adguard in the browsers does not work, maybe because it's the router DNS?  The picture where the box is seen is from a machine where adguard is not installed at all.  \r\n> \r\n> While making this query, I saw a lot of references to information on the settings for adguard, can you point me to the manual?  I don't even know if I am using some of the settings or not, so I could not really answer the questions.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/X9bzzF4.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/yimObJ0.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/54ilnKm.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11.3\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://unfiltered.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.freshdirect.com/login/login.jsp?successPage=/your_account/chef_table.jsp](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freshdirect.com%2Flogin%2Flogin.jsp%3FsuccessPage%3D%2Fyour_account%2Fchef_table.jsp)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145214/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1480100224","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145214#issuecomment-1480100224","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/145214","id":1480100224,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85YOImA","user":{"login":"quaybj","id":49235715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjM1NzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49235715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quaybj","html_url":"https://github.com/quaybj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quaybj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quaybj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quaybj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quaybj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quaybj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quaybj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quaybj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quaybj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quaybj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-22T18:54:56Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T18:54:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, looks like you have to be a customer and logged in to get to the banner URL.
