However, a new version of GoatRAT functions as a Banking Trojan, specifically aimed at Brazilian banks.\r\n\r\nLike other types of Banking Trojans, GoatRAT utilizes the Accessibility service to implement an Automatic Transfer System (ATS) framework, which enables the transfer of money from the victim’s account using the PIX key. The PIX key is used to perform the instant payment. This malware currently targets three Brazilian banks: NUBank, Banco Inter, and PagBank.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40774281/226697704-8d3874d2-43e6-4dbb-a8bb-5796352dccbf.png)\r\n\r\nURL source: https://blog.cyble.com/2023/03/14/goatrat-android-banking-trojan-variant-targeting-brazilian-banks/\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nBlock URL's:\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n<!--StartFragment-->\r\n\r\nURL | Description\r\n-- | -- \r\nhxxps://bit[.]ly/nubankmodulo | Shortened malware distribution URL\r\nhxxps://goatrat[.]com/apks/apk20.apk | Malware distribution URL\r\nhxxp://api.goatrat[.]com:3008 | C&C server to receive PIX key\r\n\r\n<!--EndFragment-->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1479041573","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175#issuecomment-1479041573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/146175","id":1479041573,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85YKGIl","user":{"login":"DandelionSprout","id":22780683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzgwNjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22780683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout","html_url":"https://github.com/DandelionSprout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-22T07:36:14Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T07:36:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I propose:\r\n```\r\n||goatrat.com^$all\r\n||bit.ly/nubankmodulo^$all\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1479041573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-22T07:36:15Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
