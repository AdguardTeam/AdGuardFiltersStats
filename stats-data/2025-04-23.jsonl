Comment\r\n>  Lately I have noticed that in Google Chrome that my location is shown as West Yorkshire (from my API) at the bottom of the search page, when in fact I am in Hertfordshire. The only way I can get it to show my actual location (from my device) is by disabling Ad Blocking in Adguard, but this obviously defeats the object of Adguard. I have Block Location API disabled in Tracking Protection. Please could you tell me what setting to change to get my location shown correctly in Chrome, without having to disable Ad Blocking. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1

https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/203781#issuecomment-2821341330, on the second screenshot AdGuard is disabled and issue still occurs, so it's probably caused by something else and not related to AdGuard.\n\nBy the way, there are 2 different issues reported (https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/203781#issue-3010580508 and

Comment\r\n>  Lately I have noticed that in Google Chrome that my location is shown as West Yorkshire (from my API) at the bottom of the search page, when in fact I am in Hertfordshire. The only way I can get it to show my actual location (from my device) is by disabling Ad Blocking in Adguard, but this obviously defeats the object of Adguard. I have Block Location API disabled in Tracking Protection. Please could you tell me what setting to change to get my location shown correctly in Chrome, without having to disable Ad Blocking. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1

Comment\r\n>  Lately I have noticed that in Google Chrome that my location is shown as West Yorkshire (from my API) at the bottom of the search page, when in fact I am in Hertfordshire. The only way I can get it to show my actual location (from my device) is by disabling Ad Blocking in Adguard, but this obviously defeats the object of Adguard. I have Block Location API disabled in Tracking Protection. Please could you tell me what setting to change to get my location shown correctly in Chrome, without having to disable Ad Blocking. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1

Comment\r\n> I am using AdGuard 4.9 on a Pixel 4a with Android 13.  My Hotmail account has been added to the Gmail app.  I am unable to retrieve new mail from my Hotmail account when AdGuard is enabled and I am connected to Wi-Fi (any Wi-Fi, not just at home).  There are a few ways I can successfully retrieve new messages from Hotmail:\r\n> \r\n>      If I use cellular data and AdGuard is enabled, I am able to successfully retrieve new messages.\r\n>      If I use Wi-Fi and disable AdGuard, I am able to successfully retrieve new messages.\r\n>      If I use Wi-Fi and AdGuard is enabled, I can use a web browser to access Hotmail.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> So, to summarize, I am unable to retrieve new Hotmail messages in the following scenario:  connected to Wi-Fi, using the Gmail app, AdGuard enabled\r\n> \r\n> I believe I have been seeing this issue for quite a while, but just recently realized it was related to AdGuard.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/87cdw8sf1l4400k0owg4408sc8gkg8cj95xelu9u4o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/76wbpdlpas8wo0wc48kskkg8oggg00w4wln06mw6k2.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.9\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Brave\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `DNS server for other cases`, ` 75.75.75.75`, ` 75.75.76.76`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS filter (Optimized)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/202397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/202397/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2823701661","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/202397#issuecomment-2823701661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/202397","id":2823701661,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86oTkSd","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-23T09:40:09Z","updated_at":"2025-04-23T09:40:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@csquaredin Please contact support@adguard.com I don't know what causes this problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2823701661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-23T09:40:10Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> I am using AdGuard 4.9 on a Pixel 4a with Android 13.  My Hotmail account has been added to the Gmail app.  I am unable to retrieve new mail from my Hotmail account when AdGuard is enabled and I am connected to Wi-Fi (any Wi-Fi, not just at home).  There are a few ways I can successfully retrieve new messages from Hotmail:\r\n> \r\n>      If I use cellular data and AdGuard is enabled, I am able to successfully retrieve new messages.\r\n>      If I use Wi-Fi and disable AdGuard, I am able to successfully retrieve new messages.\r\n>      If I use Wi-Fi and AdGuard is enabled, I can use a web browser to access Hotmail.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> So, to summarize, I am unable to retrieve new Hotmail messages in the following scenario:  connected to Wi-Fi, using the Gmail app, AdGuard enabled\r\n> \r\n> I believe I have been seeing this issue for quite a while, but just recently realized it was related to AdGuard.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/87cdw8sf1l4400k0owg4408sc8gkg8cj95xelu9u4o.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/76wbpdlpas8wo0wc48kskkg8oggg00w4wln06mw6k2.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.9\r\nSystem version: | Android 13\r\nBrowser: | Brave\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nTracking protection options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `DNS server for other cases`, ` 75.75.75.75`, ` 75.75.76.76`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS filter (Optimized)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/202397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/202397/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-04-23T09:40:09Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n>  Lately I have noticed that in Google Chrome that my location is shown as West Yorkshire (from my API) at the bottom of the search page, when in fact I am in Hertfordshire. The only way I can get it to show my actual location (from my device) is by disabling Ad Blocking in Adguard, but this obviously defeats the object of Adguard. I have Block Location API disabled in Tracking Protection. Please could you tell me what setting to change to get my location shown correctly in Chrome, without having to disable Ad Blocking. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1

movies, docomentries etc, where I left off because the Watch Progress is not syncing.\n\nSo for example : if I only watch 15 minutes of one specific show and then stop, if I return back to that specific show later, playback DOES NOT resume from the 15 minute mark, instead that specific show by default will restart from the very beginning.\n\nCan this bug be patched/fixed on the

Comment\r\n>  Lately I have noticed that in Google Chrome that my location is shown as West Yorkshire (from my API) at the bottom of the search page, when in fact I am in Hertfordshire. The only way I can get it to show my actual location (from my device) is by disabling Ad Blocking in Adguard, but this obviously defeats the object of Adguard. I have Block Location API disabled in Tracking Protection. Please could you tell me what setting to change to get my location shown correctly in Chrome, without having to disable Ad Blocking. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1

Comment\r\n>  Lately I have noticed that in Google Chrome that my location is shown as West Yorkshire (from my API) at the bottom of the search page, when in fact I am in Hertfordshire. The only way I can get it to show my actual location (from my device) is by disabling Ad Blocking in Adguard, but this obviously defeats the object of Adguard. I have Block Location API disabled in Tracking Protection. Please could you tell me what setting to change to get my location shown correctly in Chrome, without having to disable Ad Blocking. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1

Comment\r\n>  Lately I have noticed that in Google Chrome that my location is shown as West Yorkshire (from my API) at the bottom of the search page, when in fact I am in Hertfordshire. The only way I can get it to show my actual location (from my device) is by disabling Ad Blocking in Adguard, but this obviously defeats the object of Adguard. I have Block Location API disabled in Tracking Protection. Please could you tell me what setting to change to get my location shown correctly in Chrome, without having to disable Ad Blocking. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1
