Проблемма масовая и касается всех видов устройств т операционных систем. Когда Adguard включен, то на сайте https://diamant.ua/ru/catalog/ при использовании фильтров мы получаем страницу без результатов и только при повторной перезагрузке страницы результаты фильтрации видны и мы видим товары. Когда Adguard выключен, все работает исправно, то есть мы выбрали любые фильтра, применили их и видим товары результатов фильтрации. Такой проблемы ранее не было.
