Проблемма масовая и касается всех видов устройств т операционных систем.

Comment\r\n> I use the app “Downie” https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/ to download audio, video, and images from various websites.   One such was of starting a download is to paste the URL of a page that contains the item you want to download.   \r\n> \r\n> This works 100% of the time for everything EXCEPT Twitter.   Excuse me, X.com.   \r\n> \r\n> So say I want to download this gif of a tornado that I just tweeted.  The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.   Disable it and you can now use either x.com or twitter.com URLs.\r\n> \r\n> A while back I THOUGHT i had nailed this down as being related to DNS Protection, which i had  been using at the time.  Seems like when I changed it or disabled it the problem went away, however that is not the case as of now.   So the only workaround is to change the URL manually.\r\nUsername: `@petekjohnson`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

the Pandectes GDPR compliance app for Shopify.\r\n> We are currently the most popular app for Consent Management on the Shopify app store, and I am contacting you for an issue that our customers are facing on their stores. We have over 30.000 active stores and there is a large portion of store owners that use the \"overlay\"  position for their cookie banner and are affected by this block. The overlay position by design hides the page content by adding an opaque div and blocking scrolling. When the banner div is removed by your app from the DOM, a user cannot interact with the store, and cannot scroll at all, providing a poor experience for our mutual customers.\r\nUsername: `@ZagrebaAlex`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hwsk2ox6heogw88wo0gw0oc0osk8ssg79uug9o4dlk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/cykwv5gh8pc8osk04os4coco40gwcowrfpj2cx4640.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.17\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances\r\nOther extensions used: | None, only adGuard for testing","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-17T13:00:32Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> I use the app “Downie” https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/ to download audio, video, and images from various websites.   One such was of starting a download is to paste the URL of a page that contains the item you want to download.   \r\n> \r\n> This works 100% of the time for everything EXCEPT Twitter.   Excuse me, X.com.   \r\n> \r\n> So say I want to download this gif of a tornado that I just tweeted.  The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.   Disable it and you can now use either x.com or twitter.com URLs.\r\n> \r\n> A while back I THOUGHT i had nailed this down as being related to DNS Protection, which i had  been using at the time.  Seems like when I changed it or disabled it the problem went away, however that is not the case as of now.   So the only workaround is to change the URL manually.\r\nUsername: `@petekjohnson`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2hn926dr1ym8ssscccswg0osw4g4ccge5e4zuoc6nw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3avlpgf7gpmookk8wwok00go80g0k0or8jv4569tsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4inmkqoses6cwck00k0g4kggk084w4scuu435qluj4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/k5j80az0yyo00ggogs4gs0c0ccgs8kkplp9qmb41k0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/olobxet5y68wskgs4cgks00wc0cg04gtbazl40rees.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/dy5dcp60nvkgg4c0so84gws4sk4soocl2sdssp4tf4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.14.0.1599 nightly\r\nSystem version: | macOS 14.5 Beta (23F5074a)\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode options: | Block Java, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your IP address (208.54.104.184), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Downie Safari Extension, AdGuard Assistant","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2117486162","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862#issuecomment-2117486162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862","id":2117486162,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85-NkZS","user":{"login":"BlazDT","id":34266271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjY2Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34266271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT","html_url":"https://github.com/BlazDT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-17T12:25:37Z","updated_at":"2024-05-17T12:25:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Got the twitter to X redirect today.

the Pandectes GDPR compliance app for Shopify.\r\n> We are currently the most popular app for Consent Management on the Shopify app store, and I am contacting you for an issue that our customers are facing on their stores. We have over 30.000 active stores and there is a large portion of store owners that use the \"overlay\"  position for their cookie banner and are affected by this block. The overlay position by design hides the page content by adding an opaque div and blocking scrolling. When the banner div is removed by your app from the DOM, a user cannot interact with the store, and cannot scroll at all, providing a poor experience for our mutual customers.\r\nUsername: `@ZagrebaAlex`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hwsk2ox6heogw88wo0gw0oc0osk8ssg79uug9o4dlk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/cykwv5gh8pc8osk04os4coco40gwcowrfpj2cx4640.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.17\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances\r\nOther extensions used: | None, only adGuard for testing","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2117626536","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360#issuecomment-2117626536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360","id":2117626536,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85-OGqo","user":{"login":"ZagrebaAlex","id":81929847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxOTI5ODQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81929847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex","html_url":"https://github.com/ZagrebaAlex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZagrebaAlex/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-17T13:36:35Z","updated_at":"2024-05-17T13:36:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks Guys, I ran some tests and see that now it's working, both on Safari and on Chrome :)\r\nIs everything from your side ready now?\r\n\r\nThanks for your swift response, and to the point support.\r\nWhere can I leave a review of your app, you have been amazing 👍  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2117626536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-17T13:36:37Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> I use the app “Downie” https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/ to download audio, video, and images from various websites.   One such was of starting a download is to paste the URL of a page that contains the item you want to download.   \r\n> \r\n> This works 100% of the time for everything EXCEPT Twitter.   Excuse me, X.com.   \r\n> \r\n> So say I want to download this gif of a tornado that I just tweeted.  The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.

the Pandectes GDPR compliance app for Shopify.\r\n> We are currently the most popular app for Consent Management on the Shopify app store, and I am contacting you for an issue that our customers are facing on their stores. We have over 30.000 active stores and there is a large portion of store owners that use the \"overlay\"  position for their cookie banner and are affected by this block. The overlay position by design hides the page content by adding an opaque div and blocking scrolling. When the banner div is removed by your app from the DOM, a user cannot interact with the store, and cannot scroll at all, providing a poor experience for our mutual customers.\r\nUsername: `@ZagrebaAlex`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hwsk2ox6heogw88wo0gw0oc0osk8ssg79uug9o4dlk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/cykwv5gh8pc8osk04os4coco40gwcowrfpj2cx4640.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.17\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances\r\nOther extensions used: | None, only adGuard for testing","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2117583318","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360#issuecomment-2117583318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/179360","id":2117583318,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85-N8HW","user":{"login":"xglossyntx","id":149155649,"node_id":"U_kgDOCOPvQQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149155649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xglossyntx","html_url":"https://github.com/xglossyntx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xglossyntx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xglossyntx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xglossyntx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xglossyntx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xglossyntx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xglossyntx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xglossyntx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xglossyntx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xglossyntx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-17T13:15:34Z","updated_at":"2024-05-17T13:15:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@AdamWr Is there any reason for keeping this allow rule now?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/commit/5c54466baea70a3bf871bd381bcc4f327b569e27","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2117583318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-17T13:15:36Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> I use the app “Downie” https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/ to download audio, video, and images from various websites.   One such was of starting a download is to paste the URL of a page that contains the item you want to download.   \r\n> \r\n> This works 100% of the time for everything EXCEPT Twitter.   Excuse me, X.com.   \r\n> \r\n> So say I want to download this gif of a tornado that I just tweeted.  The URL is https://x.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 and pasting this directly into Downie will cause an error \"Error: Cannot find configuration URL.”\r\n> \r\n> If the URL is simply changed to https://twitter.com/PETEandrepete_/status/1788379241815445981 then it downloads perfectly.   \r\n> \r\n> This ONLY happens when AdGuard is running.   Disable it and you can now use either x.com or twitter.com URLs.\r\n> \r\n> A while back I THOUGHT i had nailed this down as being related to DNS Protection, which i had  been using at the time.  Seems like when I changed it or disabled it the problem went away, however that is not the case as of now.   So the only workaround is to change the URL manually.\r\nUsername: `@petekjohnson`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2hn926dr1ym8ssscccswg0osw4g4ccge5e4zuoc6nw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3avlpgf7gpmookk8wwok00go80g0k0or8jv4569tsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4inmkqoses6cwck00k0g4kggk084w4scuu435qluj4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/k5j80az0yyo00ggogs4gs0c0ccgs8kkplp9qmb41k0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/olobxet5y68wskgs4cgks00wc0cg04gtbazl40rees.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/dy5dcp60nvkgg4c0so84gws4sk4soocl2sdssp4tf4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.14.0.1599 nightly\r\nSystem version: | macOS 14.5 Beta (23F5074a)\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nStealth mode options: | Block Java, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your IP address (208.54.104.184), <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Block trackers\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Downie Safari Extension, AdGuard Assistant","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2117759463","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862#issuecomment-2117759463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/178862","id":2117759463,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85-OnHn","user":{"login":"BlazDT","id":34266271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjY2Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34266271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT","html_url":"https://github.com/BlazDT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-17T14:41:22Z","updated_at":"2024-05-17T14:41:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No ad shown, existing ext-CSS rules hide them for me.\r\n@AdguardTeam/filters-maintainers please check.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2117759463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-17T14:41:23Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
