Even though everything appears to be working i can no longer watch anything without intrusive ads.\r\nUsername: `03_daubs.avenues@icloud.com`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/l4zr68dibpwoksgoo0oko8ckgk040kcdhcbjp6wl2o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/75n2jduyuokcwc440kwwgk0kg480c0o9miz4tpuyrs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.16.3.1867 release\r\nSystem version: | MacOS 15.3.1 (Build 24D70)\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js)<br>AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | AdGuard Assistant (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js)<br>\r\nReferrer: | [https://un.undealtteety.top/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fun.undealtteety.top%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | adguard assistant\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=true&channel=release&clid=SCOTuJ&custom_filters=&dns.bootstraps=&dns.custom_filters=DnsUserRules&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_enabled=false&dns.fallbacks=&dns.filters=1&dns.servers=https%3A%2F%2Fdns.adguard-dns.com%2Fdns-query&dns.timeout=2000&extensions=AdGuard+Assistant+%28script%3B+url%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fassistant%2F4.3%2Fassistant.user.js%29%2CAdGuard+Extra+%28script%3B+url%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29%2CAdGuard+Popup+Blocker+%28script%3B+url%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fpopup-blocker%2F2.5%2Fpopupblocker.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=2.3.4&product_type=Mac&product_version=2.16.3.1867+release&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fun.undealtteety.top%2F&scheme_version=3&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_third_party_auth=false&stealth.block_trackers=true&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=false&stealth.dpi=false&stealth.enabled=false&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.java=true&stealth.location=true&stealth.push=true&stealth.strip_url=false&stealth.third_party_cookies=180&stealth.webrtc=false&stealth.x_client=true&system_version=MacOS+15.3.1+%28Build+24D70%29&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Macintosh%3B+Intel+Mac+OS+X+10_15_7%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F133.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&utm_campaign=report&utm_medium=assistant&utm_source=mac)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-07T07:30:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\n- [x] This is not an ad/bug report.\n\n### Problem description\n\nSome sites (such as dealabs.com, to quote one I know) track by passing each clicks through advertising agencies.\nWith the new version of the $urltransform tool, you can finally “clean up” the links.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nhttps://dealabs.digidip.net/visit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lycamobile.fr%2Ffr%2Fbundle%2Fforfait-lyca-s-plus-200gb%2F&ppref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dealabs.com%2F&ref=ppr-fr-1714412352\n\nto gives

solution\n\n```\n/^https?:\\/\\/(?:[a-z0-9-]+\\.)*?dealabs\\.digidip\\.net\\/visit\\?url=/$urltransform=/%3A/:/\n/^https?:\\/\\/(?:[a-z0-9-]+\\.)*?dealabs\\.digidip\\.net\\/visit\\?url=/$urltransform=/%2F/\\//\n/^https?:\\/\\/(?:[a-z0-9-]+\\.)*?dealabs\\.digidip\\.net\\/visit\\?url=/$urltransform=/%3F/?/\n/^https?:\\/\\/(?:[a-z0-9-]+\\.)*?dealabs\\.digidip\\.net\\/visit\\?url=/$urltransform=/%3D/=/\n/^https?:\\/\\/(?:[a-z0-9-]+\\.)*?dealabs\\.digidip\\.net\\/visit\\?url=/$urltransform=/^https?:\\/\\/(?:[a-z0-9-]+\\.)*?dealabs\\.digidip\\.net.*url=([^&]*).*/\\$1/\n```\n\nThe first 4 rules are only for decoding special characters, as the $urltransform tool unfortunately can't do this ([yet](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1915)).
