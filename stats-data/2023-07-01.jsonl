Since then websites have been acting weird. So I undid every rule I had, but the issue persists where some pages don't load properly even if I turn AdBlock off. I do not know what else it can be unless its a chrome bug? Safari still works well even with adblock on. Could it be a chrome x adblock combo problem?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/k2vntr83deogwg4so80ocg8kgsc0owkfy6usksbabk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/8i1d6hlc1b8kg8wwcgks4ow4c0k00ggrovnj1b3d5w.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.56\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>List-KR\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1615932497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-01T14:04:25Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
