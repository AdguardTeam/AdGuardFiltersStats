I don't have a screenshot or picture of it. But this behavior is across the board on all of my devices. I also have an Nvidia Shield and the Peacock app on my android phone. They all were blocking ads, and yesterday we noticed they are no longer blocking ads. \r\n2. I have updated all of my filters and the adguard version. This is currently running on a Raspberry Pi. No changes have been made to my network or devices. So not sure what would have caused the ads all of a sudden. \r\n\r\n3.

I don't have a screenshot or picture of it. But this behavior is across the board on all of my devices. I also have an Nvidia Shield and the Peacock app on my android phone. They all were blocking ads, and yesterday we noticed they are no longer blocking ads. \r\n2. I have updated all of my filters and the adguard version. This is currently running on a Raspberry Pi. No changes have been made to my network or devices. So not sure what would have caused the ads all of a sudden. \r\n\r\n3.

I don't have a screenshot or picture of it. But this behavior is across the board on all of my devices. I also have an Nvidia Shield and the Peacock app on my android phone. They all were blocking ads, and yesterday we noticed they are no longer blocking ads. \r\n2. I have updated all of my filters and the adguard version. This is currently running on a Raspberry Pi. No changes have been made to my network or devices. So not sure what would have caused the ads all of a sudden. \r\n\r\n3.

I don't have a screenshot or picture of it. But this behavior is across the board on all of my devices. I also have an Nvidia Shield and the Peacock app on my android phone. They all were blocking ads, and yesterday we noticed they are no longer blocking ads. \r\n2. I have updated all of my filters and the adguard version. This is currently running on a Raspberry Pi. No changes have been made to my network or devices. So not sure what would have caused the ads all of a sudden. \r\n\r\n3.
