It automatically launches YouTube app on iOS iPhone and plays ads without showing option to share. I’ve tried this haphazardly and it’s unstable, sometimes showing the share options buy options do not include share with Adguard or the edit options when edited won’t include the option to add share with Adguard. That is not until the preroll ads are played or skipped when allowed and then the share button for actual video can be utilized to show the share with Adguard appears and can be used to properly show the anticipated share with Adguard which will only then successfully work as intended.\r\n> \r\n> It’s like the link is written to refuse the option to share with Adguard or it intentionally disallows editing all options to include share with Adguard to refuse the user intent until the ads are played within YouTube app on iPhone iOS 18.2\r\n> \r\n> After all the mucking around, I simply pressed the link itself and it played in the Fora app without ads. I suppose the app is simply a browser instance with ads blocked through Adguard license. This is better but it is a case of not being aware of the best method or did Google find a way to bypass the share with Adguard methodology with link initiated within YouTube app and bypass Safari and iOS share methods?\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> I’ll try to remember the shorter as preferred next time. But thought Adguard support should be aware of this.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/rwjrhjtwybkw44wo4wwc8gwc48ksooks5yeysis0cg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.7\r\nSystem version: | iOS 18.2\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>Phishing URL Blocklist, <br/>Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin, <br/>uBlock Origin – Badware risks<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/195357/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/195357/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-12-28T15:20:51Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
