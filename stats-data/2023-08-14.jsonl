browser)\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/6276915/e1cd4bf8-b470-451a-b5ec-6d3381b77b37)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis option is also for autoclicking Cookie Banners provided by Mozilla, but also in a safe way to not break the page.\r\nThe question here is now, in which way it interfere with AdGuard.\r\n\r\nThe cookiebanners.service.mode is also useful for some pages, for example https://www.n-tv.de/\r\nCompared with AdGuard solution, it only shows the Cookie Pop-up one time shortly, while AdGuard needs to extra seconds to autoclick.\r\n\r\nMaybe Mozillas solution might be not perfect.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can check again the page with that

The ticket #781518 was raised. It seems as a bad communication between the app and the Safari assistant. On example 1, we see that the add is blocked, but my user role using the \"Element blocking\" > globo.com##section.ad-container to block the grey panel is not being blocked. On the second screenshot, not even the ads are being blocked inside Google. Both cases are not happening on Edge using the web browser extension (same laptop).\r\n\r\n2.

my personal laptop to my work laptop is not working. The ticket #781518 was raised. It seems as a bad communication between the app and the Safari assistant. On example 1, we see that the add is blocked, but my user role using the \"Element blocking\" > globo.com##section.ad-container to block the grey panel is not being blocked. On the second screenshot, not even the ads are being blocked inside Google. Both cases are not happening on Edge using the web browser extension (same laptop).\r\n\r\n2.

my personal laptop to my work laptop is not working. The ticket #781518 was raised. It seems as a bad communication between the app and the Safari assistant. On example 1, we see that the add is blocked, but my user role using the \"Element blocking\" > globo.com##section.ad-container to block the grey panel is not being blocked. On the second screenshot, not even the ads are being blocked inside Google. Both cases are not happening on Edge using the web browser extension (same laptop).\r\n\r\n2.

my personal laptop to my work laptop is not working. The ticket #781518 was raised. It seems as a bad communication between the app and the Safari assistant. On example 1, we see that the add is blocked, but my user role using the \"Element blocking\" > globo.com##section.ad-container to block the grey panel is not being blocked. On the second screenshot, not even the ads are being blocked inside Google. Both cases are not happening on Edge using the web browser extension (same laptop).\r\n\r\n2.

On the second screenshot, not even the ads are being blocked inside Google. Both cases are not happening on Edge using the web browser extension (same laptop).\r\n\r\n2.
