In the past week, Arkadium games has changed their set up, now offer a Premium subcription for ad free playing.  Thus on the basic free games the ads now run.  Can AdGuard be updated to stop them?

In the past week, Arkadium games has changed their set up, now offer a Premium subcription for ad free playing.  Thus on the basic free games the ads now run.  Can AdGuard be updated to stop them?
