Comment\r\n> The AdGuard Social Media filter started blocking the WSJ share button about two weeks ago.  I only today troubleshooted which filter was causing the issue.  \r\n> \r\n> I share a lot of \"unlocked\" links from the WSJ to other people and Twitter, etc.  \r\n> \r\n> Fanboy's social blocking list does not make the WSJ share button disappear.  \r\n> \r\n> If this was a heavily scripted third party \"share to social media sites\" widget, I would probably want it blocked, too, but this is just the native WSJ menu and the only way to obtain a paywall free link for other people to access.  \r\n> \r\n> Also one of the few US News sites that offer a direct share to Telegram option, which is nice for those who don't use their native share to other app buttons lol. \r\n> \r\n> If you need anything else please let me know. \r\nUsername: `@vonDubenshire`\r\n\r\n###
