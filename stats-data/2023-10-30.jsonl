Hi @thommesborg - I'm an engineer at DuckDuckGo and investigating this issue that multiple users have reported to us. If you are able to share a bit more information about your setup that might help us reproduce and fix the issue. e.g. What device are you using (e.g. intel or M1 mac), what other extensions/privacy protections do you have installed? Thanks!\r\n\r\nHi @sammacbeth,\r\n\r\nI’m using a MacBook Air M2 with macOS 14.1\r\nThere are no other extensions in use. \r\nAs of now I’ve realized that on an unresponsive results page the search-bar is still in focus. If you do nothing else than press enter again, the search term will be re-searched and than the results page is responsive.

Если включить из блока фильтров Блокировка раздражителей даже только этот один фильтр Фильтр всплывающих окон а другие фильтры из раздела Блокировка раздражителей не включать то эта проблема всё-равно сразу же воспользводится.

Если включить из блока фильтров Блокировка раздражителей даже только этот один фильтр Фильтр всплывающих окон а другие фильтры из раздела Блокировка раздражителей не включать то эта проблема всё-равно сразу же воспользводится.

Теперь же войдя под своим аккаунтом сюда на Github уже после создания этой задачи здесь на Github в результате заполнения мною формы репорта из приложения AdGuard я обнаружил что я не был автоматически подписан на эту задачу здесь на Github и мне пришлось включать эту подписку автоматически хотя при создании репорта через форму репорта от AdGuard я заранее как обычно указал свой ник здесь на Github но не нашёл в новой форме репорта от AdGuard (а её дизайн и содержимое немного обновились по сравнению с тем что было ранее недавно!) возможность сразу же включить галочку для автоматической подписки на создаваемую в результате репорта задачу здесь на Github. Это очень плохо и неудобно, раньше было удобно. Очень хотелось бы комментариев и по этому вопросу и исправления и этой попутной проблемы как можно скорее.\r\n\r\nЗаранее спасибо.
