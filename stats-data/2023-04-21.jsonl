variety of third-party DNS providers, along with the regular AdGuard DNS, return the correct IP addresses for Etsy, but AdGuard Family returns 94.140.14.35 as the IP address for www.etsy.com;  that turns out to be the blocked-site page, which fails with a privacy error because the blocked-site page does not have a TLS certificate for etsy.com and that domain has HSTS (one of the bundled HSTS pins in recent browsers), so the TLS failure cannot be bypassed (I forgot to open the \"Advanced\" button when taking that screenshot, but that's basically what that message said).\r\n> \r\n> I fail to see how Etsy qualifies as \"adult content\" worthy of blocking via the family filter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

URL Tracking filter lists strips the `smid` parameter from Amazon URLs. The `smid` parameter on Amazon sites represents the seller ID. Removing this parameter subtly breaks navigation on product pages with multiple sellers, automatically redirecting the user to the \"default\" seller/buy box rather than to the specific one the user had clicked on. \r\n\r\nThis breaks the functionality of some external sites (e.g. price tracking tools) that direct the user to a product page with a specific seller ID because they've found that product to be in stock at a certain price by that specific seller.\r\n\r\nThis is most easily reproduced by browsing to a product page, visiting the \"Other sellers\" section, adding another seller's product to the cart, navigating to the cart and then clicking on the line item of that product (remember the seller name and price).\r\n\r\nNormally the site would take you back to the product page, with the `smid` parameter matching the product in your cart, which would present you with the buy box and seller information of the product that you clicked on, but since AdGuard filters remove this parameter, the user ends up on the default product page.\r\n\r\nExample URLs:\r\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J4HJ98L (default/preferred seller)\r\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J4HJ98L?smid=A26EKWRR8KY4BH (same product, different seller)\r\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J4HJ98L?smid=AIIAYKZQOBT02\r\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J4HJ98L?smid=A14EEANAI4EN1Q\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148958/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1517658614","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148958#issuecomment-1517658614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/148958","id":1517658614,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85adaH2","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-21T11:05:01Z","updated_at":"2023-04-21T11:05:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks, removed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1517658614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-04-21T11:05:01Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
