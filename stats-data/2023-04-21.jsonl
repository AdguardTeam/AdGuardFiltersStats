variety of third-party DNS providers, along with the regular AdGuard DNS, return the correct IP addresses for Etsy, but AdGuard Family returns 94.140.14.35 as the IP address for www.etsy.com;  that turns out to be the blocked-site page, which fails with a privacy error because the blocked-site page does not have a TLS certificate for etsy.com and that domain has HSTS (one of the bundled HSTS pins in recent browsers), so the TLS failure cannot be bypassed (I forgot to open the \"Advanced\" button when taking that screenshot, but that's basically what that message said).\r\n> \r\n> I fail to see how Etsy qualifies as \"adult content\" worthy of blocking via the family filter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
