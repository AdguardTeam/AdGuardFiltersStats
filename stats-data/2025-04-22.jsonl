The mobile version of https://ozon.ru may occasionally display a blank white screen. In order to reproduce the issue, you may need to reload the page a couple of times. You must be logged in in order to reproduce the issue (If necessary, I can provide you with an account). Disabling the \"AdGuard – Mobile Ads\" filter list fixes the issue. Disabling cosmetic filters also fixes the issue. Reproducible on both Kiwi Browser and Fennec from F-Droid.\n\n2.

Comment\r\n>  Lately I have noticed that in Google Chrome that my location is shown as West Yorkshire (from my API) at the bottom of the search page, when in fact I am in Hertfordshire. The only way I can get it to show my actual location (from my device) is by disabling Ad Blocking in Adguard, but this obviously defeats the object of Adguard. I have Block Location API disabled in Tracking Protection. Please could you tell me what setting to change to get my location shown correctly in Chrome, without having to disable Ad Blocking. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1
