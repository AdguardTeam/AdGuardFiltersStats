But when i disable ad base filter then Brave Shields working without any issue. But i do not want to disable ag base filter for this one issue.\r\n> \r\n> Step to reproduce the issue :- Go to brave shields > set it to Aggressive > then go to custom filter > import ag base filter from this link https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/ublock/filters/2_without_easylist.txt then open the inbox of mail.com. you will see the blank frame.
