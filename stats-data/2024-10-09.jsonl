ATTENTION\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.

@FeST1VaL Странно.

Тестовая страница без ВПН почему то вообще не открывается. Но результат с ВПН показал на видео.\r\n2. Почему то вообще пустой сегодня журнал и не обновляется... даже после перезапуска программы...\r\n3. 24.7.6.974 (64-bit) Яндекс браузер.\r\n\r\nP.S после написания обращения выше я не мог вообще попасть на следующий день на сайт yummyanime.tv (писало типо сайт разорвал соединение или что то такое), сайт смог открыться когда я добавил в исключения (правила фильтрации) разрешил всякие beacon или же разрешил метрику яндекса... Сегодня открывается без правил вроде как, ну как минимум я удалил (не помню попало ли на видео). \r\nТак же на видео показал что и в ВК есть реклама, т.е реклама условно на всех сайтах есть.
