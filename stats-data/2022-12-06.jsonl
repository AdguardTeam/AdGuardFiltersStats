issue.\r\n\r\n### What product do you use?\r\n\r\nAdGuard for Android, AdGuard for Windows\r\n\r\n### AdGuard version\r\n\r\nAndroid 3.6.10 (51)\r\n\r\n### What type of problem have you encountered?\r\n\r\nWebsite or app doesn't work properly\r\n\r\n### Which browser(s) do you use?\r\n\r\nFirefox\r\n\r\n### Which device do you use?\r\n\r\nMobile\r\n\r\n### Where is the problem encountered?\r\n\r\nhttps://m.cafe.naver.com, https://cafe.naver.com, https://arca.live\r\n\r\n### What filters do you have enabled?\r\n\r\nAdGuard Base filter, AdGuard Mobile Ads filter, List-KR\r\n\r\n### What Stealth Mode options do you have enabled?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\nAdguard for Windows and android are all the same issues.\r\nThis problem continues with changes to mobile and PC devices.\r\n\r\nNot all times.\r\nImage loading failures often occur, and sometimes both PC and Android fail to load CSS, causing web pages to become unrecognizable.\r\n\r\nAt this time, everything worked fine when the Adguard filtering was turned off.\r\n\r\nMost of them load correctly, but sometimes they don't and it doesn't seem to be a problem with the filter list.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot

So I'm having this issue where I can't use ClickUp with AdGuard enabled. This started happening around 1 month ago. I created a rule for AdGuard to ignore ClickUp, but it's useless. As long as AdGuard is enabled, ClickUp does not work. I also noticed that sometimes, if I disable the DNS protection, ClickUp works. But it's not consistent.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/QV5trTh.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/vAlqji0.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.9.1.1217\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (), <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS (DNS-Over-QUIC)`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter, The Block List Project - Abuse List (adguard), The Block List Project - Ads List (adguard), The Block List Project - Facebook List (adguard), The Block List Project - Malware List (adguard), The Block List Project - Phishing List (adguard), The Block List Project - Ramsonware List (adguard), The Block List Project - Redirect List (adguard), The Block List Project - Scam List (adguard), The Block List Project - Tracking List (adguard).`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Assistant, AdGuard Extra.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/136811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/136811/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-12-06T18:13:21Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
