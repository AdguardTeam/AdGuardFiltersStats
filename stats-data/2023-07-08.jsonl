Comment\r\n> Здравствуйте! Прошу помочь, когда AdGuard включён приложение Dasher работает некорректно, а я работаю через него. Само приложение ставится на паузу в течении пары минут после запуска, если продолжить работу то снова ставится на паузу через пару минут. Если выключить AdGuard проблема проходит. На приложение Uber не влияет и работает корректно. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/becnoz7pinsww4kg4040cwcsw4o8ggsftaoxsdj868.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/gaa1b3oaea88cgokkgss4koo0osog8ojzbwpl7hrn4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/fgbop0zc6e0c8w40s48wc8k440sowo4638t2bc1tu0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/iwurttib7i0woo08g4s4kcog8c4kw40sywobub3k74.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/9x7myff2hvs4kko048wsk8g484cow84pi0s9a8a1us.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.6\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS `<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155490/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1626405422","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155490#issuecomment-1626405422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155490","id":1626405422,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85g8Pou","user":{"login":"Persik001","id":89926736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTI2NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89926736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001","html_url":"https://github.com/Persik001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-08T01:20:18Z","updated_at":"2023-07-08T01:20:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![IMG_3387](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/89926736/6215fbb0-8ce9-4425-85d7-b71a7b93a46a)\r\n![IMG_3389](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/89926736/5100977e-d1b4-4611-8f45-f12db50c5a8f)\r\n![IMG_3391](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/89926736/ec7af63d-1595-47c8-b22e-a38329067b1c)\r\n![IMG_3393](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/89926736/f20fde73-89b9-4187-85b4-4a08f8de24f8)\r\n![IMG_3395](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/89926736/27666c55-7520-4b2a-ab25-44bdef06b564)\r\n![IMG_3397](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/89926736/a61a7197-383b-44b0-abfc-facd72704ff5)\r\n![IMG_3399](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/89926736/7f3280b8-4326-4870-9030-a5ab5356d301)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1626405422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-08T01:20:21Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

just a warning if i happen to visit the site so I created a personal filter like this: `||reddit.com^$document` and it works great on the front page of reddit but if I end up on a comment page I still connect and it turns out that your generic ad list has a allowlist filter that's this: `@@||reddit.com/r/*/comments/`\r\n> \r\n> Maybe I'm wrong but that seems overly broad? I'm not sure what issue that fixes but maybe there are better ways to do it than allow all links to comment pages no matter what filters are blocking it? I mean you could just allow every page on reddit or every page on every popular website but you don't right?\r\n> Seems it was added with #10950 in 2018 but that filter was more specific, i'm not sure when it changed.\r\n> \r\n> I know I could add `,important` to my filter but I just wanted to report this cause it seems like a weird whitelist filter.\r\n> \r\n> If you think it's fine and personal filters like this are out of scope for your list then I'll accept that and work around it, I just wanted to highlight this weird filter.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/lyr00h2i8lwscgo8co40448cgo0sgoc2ydl6dknj5k.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | ublock origin\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1626393650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-08T00:43:12Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Здравствуйте! Прошу помочь, когда AdGuard включён приложение Dasher работает некорректно, а я работаю через него. Само приложение ставится на паузу в течении пары минут после запуска, если продолжить работу то снова ставится на паузу через пару минут. Если выключить AdGuard проблема проходит. На приложение Uber не влияет и работает корректно. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/becnoz7pinsww4kg4040cwcsw4o8ggsftaoxsdj868.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/gaa1b3oaea88cgokkgss4koo0osog8ojzbwpl7hrn4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/fgbop0zc6e0c8w40s48wc8k440sowo4638t2bc1tu0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/iwurttib7i0woo08g4s4kcog8c4kw40sywobub3k74.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/9x7myff2hvs4kko048wsk8g484cow84pi0s9a8a1us.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.6\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS `<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155490/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1626456311","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155490#issuecomment-1626456311","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/155490","id":1626456311,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85g8cD3","user":{"login":"Persik001","id":89926736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTI2NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89926736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001","html_url":"https://github.com/Persik001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persik001/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-08T02:03:24Z","updated_at":"2023-07-08T02:03:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![IMG_3401](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/89926736/93586da6-819d-437c-b9ea-566f683e4ee7)\r\n![IMG_3402](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/89926736/49c069b7-2baf-4833-8a75-e9737fa4d25c)\r\n![IMG_3403](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/89926736/f092cc4e-b177-4c82-b9e6-4c5f06d9b79f)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1626456311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-08T02:03:26Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
