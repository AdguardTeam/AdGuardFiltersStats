When the MetaMask extension is installed and active in Chrome, the coveryourtracks.eff.org test does not provide values for ‘Blocking tracking ads?’ and ‘Blocking invisible trackers?’. This problem does not occur when the MetaMask extension is disabled. It seems that issue 249, sent in 2015 (https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/249), is not working correctly today.\r\n> \r\n> To fix the issue, I disabled the following rules in “AdGuard Tracking Protection”:\r\n> ||eviltracker.net^$third-party\r\n> ||trackersimulator.org^$third-party\r\n> ||eviltracker.net^\r\n> ||trackersimulator.org^\r\n> \r\n> Then I added the following rules to “User rules” so that it works with my configuration:\r\n> ||trackersimulator.org^$stealth=referrer\r\n> ||eviltracker.net^$stealth=referrer\r\n> \r\n> Can you adjust AdGuard’s rules? Thank you.\r\nUsername: `@WakoKnight`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/2s59y0lvqnggwkwgsow0gkg44cw0wwwi5e6ljz30wo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/dwexsr2pbfkg8ggs88k4kg4owwssg4c7p7zmm11w68.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.15.1 (4386)\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11, version 22H2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash, <br>Block Java, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (coveryourtracks.eff.org), <br>Hide your IP address, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Disable WAP Push Message Routing Service, <br>Disable Windows Defender automatic samples submission, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://doh.opendns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard French\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://firstpartysimulator.org/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffirstpartysimulator.org%2F)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/165132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/165132/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-04T18:33:39Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
