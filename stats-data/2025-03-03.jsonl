( [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing#264](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing/issues/264) )\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Please check that there no another web browser extension that has adblocking feature is enabled on your web browser. It can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> Saving memory feature of your web browser or sleep feature of your operating system can interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n> In this case, please re-enable AdGuard's filtering by toggling the protection toggle.\n> Following the instructions can be needed.\n\n### The instructions\n1. Force to update the filters by clicking the reload button in AdGuard Browser Extension/AdGuard mobile or update tray menu in your system tray. [^2]\n2. Reload the YouTube webpage without cache by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> [^3].\n3. Clear cache, cookies and site data of your web browser.\n4. Re-open your web browser completely (checking your system monitor[^4] will be better).\n\n[^1]: https://gitlab.com/adblockinc/ext/adblockplus/adblockplusui/-/issues/1576\n[^2]: [AdGuard for Windows](https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-windows/overview/#tray-menu); [AdGuard for Mac](https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-mac/overview/#updates-check); \n[^3]: On macOS, <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>\n[^4]: Task Manager on Windows, System Monitor on GNOME Shell, KDE System Guard on KDE Plasma or Activity Monitor on macOS. \n\n\nPrevious issue https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/194856","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198973/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2693153719","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198973#issuecomment-2693153719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/198973","id":2693153719,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86ghkO3","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-03T02:48:08Z","updated_at":"2025-03-03T02:48:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf4Uap1lf94](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dsf4Uap1lf94)\r\n### Comment\r\n> No se puede ver videos de YouTube\r\nUsername: `@KKMM`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/yj4umdsfslwsg88o08k4cs0ksg8kc0idbd9iditrsw.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/im464yrkuwgs00kowgo8cgckogookgk9a7p6ut0a68.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.0.201 MV3\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | Seguridad de windows","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2693153719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-03T02:48:09Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

This blocking is causing functionality issues on websites like kpkuang.one and kpkuang.org.\r\n> \r\n> When users visit these websites, many AJAX-related features fail to work properly, including the search bar and comment data retrieval. This is because these websites use “kpdata.flixfiend.top” as their backend domain for AJAX requests.\r\n> \r\n> I’d like to point out that flixfiend.top does not contain any advertising content. I suspect the domain was reported and blocked because “mystats.flixfiend.top” uses Matomo for analytics tracking. However, blocking the entire flixfiend.top domain and all its subdomains seems excessive.\r\n> \r\n> If the concern is specifically about Matomo tracking, I suggest implementing a more targeted filtering rule rather than blocking the entire domain, which is currently breaking essential website functionality.\r\n> \r\n> Could you please review this rule and consider a more specific approach that doesn’t affect legitimate website functionality?\r\nUsername: `@gotokpkuang`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/456b9g7qrsg0ocskogwgscgs4csc8k0thimitdawhw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qb10pezaeu8gck48gk0kk80sk04skw485e1nh9n2yo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.49 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199896/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-03T07:56:09Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Ответ, что воспроизвести проблему не удалось, не принимается! Нужно очищать данные браузера, перед тем, как воспроизводить! \r\n> Также информация о том, что нужно включить фильтр раздражителей, также не принимается! его можно включить только при использовании браузерного помощника. Если используется связка помощник + платная версия adguard на ПК, то никакие настройки помощника недоступны! А версии для ПК данный фильтр отсутствует. \r\n> Очевидно, чьто Яндекс платит Adguard за показ своей рекламы. Только вот, я заплатил adguard за линцензию.

experiencing a problem with the AdGuard filter rule that blocks the domain “flixfiend.top” (rule: ||flixfiend.top^). This blocking is causing functionality issues on websites like kpkuang.one and kpkuang.org.\r\n> \r\n> When users visit these websites, many AJAX-related features fail to work properly, including the search bar and comment data retrieval. This is because these websites use “kpdata.flixfiend.top” as their backend domain for AJAX requests.\r\n> \r\n> I’d like to point out that flixfiend.top does not contain any advertising content. I suspect the domain was reported and blocked because “mystats.flixfiend.top” uses Matomo for analytics tracking. However, blocking the entire flixfiend.top domain and all its subdomains seems excessive.\r\n> \r\n> If the concern is specifically about Matomo tracking, I suggest implementing a more targeted filtering rule rather than blocking the entire domain, which is currently breaking essential website functionality.\r\n> \r\n> Could you please review this rule and consider a more specific approach that doesn’t affect legitimate website functionality?\r\nUsername: `@gotokpkuang`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/456b9g7qrsg0ocskogwgscgs4csc8k0thimitdawhw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qb10pezaeu8gck48gk0kk80sk04skw485e1nh9n2yo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.49 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199896/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2693811141","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199896#issuecomment-2693811141","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199896","id":2693811141,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86gkEvF","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-03T09:49:34Z","updated_at":"2025-03-03T09:49:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As I see, it also has an ad server and a tracker domain that I've blocked.

Its been weeks i am reporting it to adguard and they have been no help at all which is really frustrating. \r\nUsername: `@Sakciit`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/aj9oevp8rdsg4sgsck0kkwccw00go0g14cun3c8hri.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ocen7n1xrsgswcggk8wgsgck0sk084cmk99gtx9yis.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/6vtlcst5fi0wwcwwk8888owc0okkws82v22k5pdu9c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.8\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets\r\nOther extensions used: | Non","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2693937026","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236#issuecomment-2693937026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/197236","id":2693937026,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86gkjeC","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-03T10:36:19Z","updated_at":"2025-03-03T10:36:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Now web tests are ok.\n\nThis - not ok.

the new rule doesn't work for the old issue, but if I use like this (without `:not([class]):not([id]):not([role])`)\n\nPerhaps related to the one of the `:not()` issues in https://github.com/AdguardTeam/ExtendedCss/issues\n\nRegarding a rule with `div[id^=\"markdown-content\"]`, it works fine on the main page but unfortunately after searching/asking something it causes that log in button doesn't work (at least on my end).\nI have added a different rule which fixes popup like on the screenshot in https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/194078#issue-2718626327, but sometimes there is also another \"fullscreen\" popup which looks the same as when log in button is clicked.

experiencing a problem with the AdGuard filter rule that blocks the domain “flixfiend.top” (rule: ||flixfiend.top^). This blocking is causing functionality issues on websites like kpkuang.one and kpkuang.org.\r\n> \r\n> When users visit these websites, many AJAX-related features fail to work properly, including the search bar and comment data retrieval. This is because these websites use “kpdata.flixfiend.top” as their backend domain for AJAX requests.\r\n> \r\n> I’d like to point out that flixfiend.top does not contain any advertising content. I suspect the domain was reported and blocked because “mystats.flixfiend.top” uses Matomo for analytics tracking. However, blocking the entire flixfiend.top domain and all its subdomains seems excessive.\r\n> \r\n> If the concern is specifically about Matomo tracking, I suggest implementing a more targeted filtering rule rather than blocking the entire domain, which is currently breaking essential website functionality.\r\n> \r\n> Could you please review this rule and consider a more specific approach that doesn’t affect legitimate website functionality?\r\nUsername: `@gotokpkuang`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/456b9g7qrsg0ocskogwgscgs4csc8k0thimitdawhw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qb10pezaeu8gck48gk0kk80sk04skw485e1nh9n2yo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.49 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199896/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2694039962","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199896#issuecomment-2694039962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199896","id":2694039962,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86gk8ma","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-03T11:17:31Z","updated_at":"2025-03-03T11:17:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's fixed by `EasyList China`'s author.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://www.kpkuang.one/voddetail/799743/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kpkuang.one%2Fvoddetail%2F799743%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> I’m experiencing a problem with the AdGuard filter rule that blocks the domain “flixfiend.top” (rule: ||flixfiend.top^). This blocking is causing functionality issues on websites like kpkuang.one and kpkuang.org.\r\n> \r\n> When users visit these websites, many AJAX-related features fail to work properly, including the search bar and comment data retrieval. This is because these websites use “kpdata.flixfiend.top” as their backend domain for AJAX requests.\r\n> \r\n> I’d like to point out that flixfiend.top does not contain any advertising content. I suspect the domain was reported and blocked because “mystats.flixfiend.top” uses Matomo for analytics tracking. However, blocking the entire flixfiend.top domain and all its subdomains seems excessive.\r\n> \r\n> If the concern is specifically about Matomo tracking, I suggest implementing a more targeted filtering rule rather than blocking the entire domain, which is currently breaking essential website functionality.\r\n> \r\n> Could you please review this rule and consider a more specific approach that doesn’t affect legitimate website functionality?\r\nUsername: `@gotokpkuang`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/456b9g7qrsg0ocskogwgscgs4csc8k0thimitdawhw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qb10pezaeu8gck48gk0kk80sk04skw485e1nh9n2yo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.49 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199896/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-03T11:16:14Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n

experiencing a problem with the AdGuard filter rule that blocks the domain “flixfiend.top” (rule: ||flixfiend.top^). This blocking is causing functionality issues on websites like kpkuang.one and kpkuang.org.\r\n> \r\n> When users visit these websites, many AJAX-related features fail to work properly, including the search bar and comment data retrieval. This is because these websites use “kpdata.flixfiend.top” as their backend domain for AJAX requests.\r\n> \r\n> I’d like to point out that flixfiend.top does not contain any advertising content. I suspect the domain was reported and blocked because “mystats.flixfiend.top” uses Matomo for analytics tracking. However, blocking the entire flixfiend.top domain and all its subdomains seems excessive.\r\n> \r\n> If the concern is specifically about Matomo tracking, I suggest implementing a more targeted filtering rule rather than blocking the entire domain, which is currently breaking essential website functionality.\r\n> \r\n> Could you please review this rule and consider a more specific approach that doesn’t affect legitimate website functionality?\r\nUsername: `@gotokpkuang`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/456b9g7qrsg0ocskogwgscgs4csc8k0thimitdawhw.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/qb10pezaeu8gck48gk0kk80sk04skw485e1nh9n2yo.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.4.49 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199896/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2693978729","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199896#issuecomment-2693978729","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/199896","id":2693978729,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86gktpp","user":{"login":"cjx82630","id":9707241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDcyNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9707241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjx82630","html_url":"https://github.com/cjx82630","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjx82630/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjx82630/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjx82630/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjx82630/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjx82630/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjx82630/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjx82630/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjx82630/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjx82630/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-03T10:52:38Z","updated_at":"2025-03-03T10:52:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"https://github.com/easylist/easylistchina/commit/5626b641bce32594e236dbc382b7865ce49353f6","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2693978729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-03T10:52:39Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
