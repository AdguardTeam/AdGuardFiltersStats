Через системный днс и адгуард днс не грузятся обложки исполнителей, в том числе видеообложки. Можно сказать что вообще никакие изображения не загружаются. Но при этом все грузится при использовании comss dns или next dns. Как бы заставить работать на адгуард днс? Пытался через пользовательские правила и rewritedns, но че то не особо вышло.\r\n> \r\n> Я так понимаю что все, что не загружается хранится по адресам *scdn.co, пытался через пользовательские правила направить запросы на эти адреса через comss dns, но не получилось, все равно ничего не загружается\r\n> \r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/tlcmw24flq84gcwcko4kksgs8sk4wkoab6h341iy5c.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/2sps8mqrnqck0skosko4g04488ogc0kfuim980xt7s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | Private AdGuard DNS server\r\nSystem version: | `Любое устройство `\r\nBrowser: | Приложение spotify\r\nBlocklists: | <b>General:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/211112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/211112/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-08-11T06:31:16Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Через системный днс и адгуард днс не грузятся обложки исполнителей, в том числе видеообложки. Можно сказать что вообще никакие изображения не загружаются. Но при этом все грузится при использовании comss dns или next dns. Как бы заставить работать на адгуард днс? Пытался через пользовательские правила и rewritedns, но че то не особо вышло.\r\n> \r\n> Я так понимаю что все, что не загружается хранится по адресам *scdn.co, пытался через пользовательские правила направить запросы на эти адреса через comss dns, но не получилось, все равно ничего не загружается\r\n> \r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/tlcmw24flq84gcwcko4kksgs8sk4wkoab6h341iy5c.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adtidy.org/sitereports/2sps8mqrnqck0skosko4g04488ogc0kfuim980xt7s.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | Private AdGuard DNS server\r\nSystem version: | `Любое устройство `\r\nBrowser: | Приложение spotify\r\nBlocklists: | <b>General:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/211112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/211112/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3173931266","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/211112#issuecomment-3173931266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/211112","id":3173931266,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM869LlkC","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-11T09:27:40Z","updated_at":"2025-08-11T09:27:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Через системный днс и адгуард днс не грузятся обложки исполнителей, в том числе видеообложки.\n\nС нашим ДНС такой проблемы не заметил.\n\n> по адресам *scdn.co\n\nЭти домены не блокируем.

ATTENTION\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. That means that sometime you can face the detection message.\n> If all the following instructions do not work, please **email filters@adguard.com** or wait until any update is available. \n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use another adblocker in the same time because using another adblocker can delay/lags the YouTube loading (e.g., AdBlock Plus and AdBlock)[^1] OR interfere AdGuard's filtering functionality.\n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> Please do not use an userscript related to the bypassing YouTube detection message like [TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing).\n> Recently, YouTube anti-adblock script added infinite dummy advertisements to try to neutralize the userscript.
