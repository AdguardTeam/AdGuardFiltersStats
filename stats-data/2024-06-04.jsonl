Unfortunately, I can't check this page because when registering, the site asks for data that I don't have. Please switch off all third party extensions and leave only AdGuard, try to disable stealth mode filters/features one by one and when you find which one is causing the problem leave it alone. Open the filter log, refresh the page with the problematic filter and send a screenshot of the filter log in the comments of this issue on github.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2147044018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-04T09:25:50Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
