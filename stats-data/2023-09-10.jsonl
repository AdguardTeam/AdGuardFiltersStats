Hello. Could you please clear the filtering log in the AdGuard app, repeat the ads in the app and send screenshots of the filtering log while the app is running?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is what you're looking for,but I found something similar in the code,so I took screenshots of them.\r\nFurthermore, I encountered a situation in the app where, due to accidentally tapping on a location near the center of the screen,\r\nit redirected me to download an APK file within the advertised content. The advertisements in question are from different websites each time, \r\nincluding the likes of JD.com,pinduoduo.com, and various other types of ads.\r\n![12660_0](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/108153456/d80be060-e68b-4b10-89e3-91bc04a55907)\r\n![12669_0](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/108153456/a724ab4b-fbe2-4c0f-816b-c36b73bf1bec)\r\n![12661_0](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/108153456/c14df240-24f2-4452-9228-e89842c40ec9)\r\n![12662_0](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/108153456/01dee4be-d731-41f4-a233-3b5fffdba53b)\r\n![12663_0](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/108153456/02200e61-adf3-4569-905d-6d03eac1bc1f)\r\n![12664_0](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/108153456/8ef42f9d-a714-4a7b-94d3-f870ddef64cc)\r\n![12665_0](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/108153456/db0b3f30-1921-4464-b522-9ca3b9131d29)\r\n![12666_0](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/108153456/f07e9e66-f47b-4efc-911c-b3abe3f5be72)\r\n![12667_0](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/108153456/473bad2b-010c-412c-a009-38b194f861f6)\r\n![12668_0](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/108153456/92c61e2b-e67d-419e-af93-a885a0e7594e)\r\n![12670_0](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/108153456/16a2deb3-f51d-4cba-8e3d-8ff2921cfe35)\r\n![12671_0](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/108153456/40035778-cd8c-4e13-9c4b-656002f4b150)\r\n![12672_0](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/108153456/e99bfd55-dbf5-47e6-a3cb-31ce19793c2f)\r\n![12673_0](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/108153456/6ec28991-246d-447c-b5af-a030a55a9e2a)\r\n![12674_0](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/108153456/915f75e0-621d-40d9-836d-ba294880eb77)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1712775028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-10T10:21:25Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
