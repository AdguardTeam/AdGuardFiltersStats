@votexxd\r\n> Hi.\r\n> Es gibt verschiedene Tabs bei Aternos. Bei dem einen kann man zb. den server starten, bei anderen den server einstellen, bei anderen mods installieren usw.\r\n> Wenn man von tab zu tab wechselt kommt immer wieder die selbe meldung das man doch den AdBlocker aus machen soll. Dazu kommt noch das wenn ich die Meldung per browser assistant manuell entfernen möchte manche buttons auf der website dann nicht mehr funktionieren wie zb. der button um den server zu starten.\r\n> \r\n> Abseits des Problems das die Meldung überhaupt erscheint habe ich ebenfalls das problem das selbst wenn AdGuard ausgeschaltet ist mir die Website immer noch diese Meldung anzeigt. Auch wenn ich dazu noch mein Antivirus ausschalte oder Aternos auf die whitelist setzte wird die Meldung immer noch angezeigt.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ciqnxoduasgg048g4o08gcw4ck04k4csqyw2bsz02o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.14\r\nBrowser: | OperaGX\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Standart: Systemvoreinstellung (Verwenden sie die Systemstandard-DNS-Server ihres ISP (Internet Service Provider) )`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdBlockID\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra\r\nAdGuard Pop-up-Blocker\r\nOther extensions used: | Avas Premium Security, AdGuard Browser-Assistent","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1684208212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-18T17:15:36Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
