Conent Blocker is making websites unscrollable. The problem is caused by removing the policy popup thus it's impossible to click 'Accept'. To be more specific, AdGuard doesn't remove it at all but lefts the invisible layer that covers document body, causing the problem.

2 (AdGuard off): I press \"Attachment\", choose the image I want to upload to the card and get the success message. The image appears in the card.\r\n> \r\n> Every once in a while an image goes through when AdGuard is on (because I forget to turn it off), but it's mostly the first one, then nothing else goes through until I turn AdGuard off. \r\n> Oftentimes I also get an error (from Trello on their website) that I am not connected to the server. Everything (creating cards, changing text etc) continues to work except for the image upload, and once AdGuard is off there are no more server error messages on the Trello site either. \r\n> Note that all my Trello pages are affected by this issue, not just the \"Rezepte\" one from the screenshots.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/27u9kQt.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9IRBpWq.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Germany\r\nOther extensions used: | Extensions: 1Password Beta, AdGuard AdBlocker, Download Manager (S3), Evernote Web Clipper, Nervenschoner (Adblocker, but I disabled that and the issue persists), Perfect Home, Save to Pocket (mini), The Camelizer // Anti-virus: Bitdefender Antivirus Free","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/139468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/139468/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-02T13:48:55Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Помимо этого, я включил ECH, так как советовали авторы ваших статей на вашем сайте.
