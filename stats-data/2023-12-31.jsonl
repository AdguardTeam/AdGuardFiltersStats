They usually embed Youtube videos.\r\n> -  The news (main) page doesn't load. Keep getting the \"Couldn't fetch news. Please try again\" error (screenshot). If I click on \"Try Again\" link 3-7 times, it eventually load even with AdGuard enabled.\r\n> -  This app also has an embedded browser shows news articles from news sources.
