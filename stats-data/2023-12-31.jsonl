They usually embed Youtube videos.\r\n> -  The news (main) page doesn't load. Keep getting the \"Couldn't fetch news. Please try again\" error (screenshot). If I click on \"Try Again\" link 3-7 times, it eventually load even with AdGuard enabled.\r\n> -  This app also has an embedded browser shows news articles from news sources.

When I use a Chromium based brwoser, the page loads fine. When I use the AdGuard Extension, the page also loads fine. So the issue is only with AdGuard for Windows+Firefox.

I have to disable AdGuard entirely to get page access.\r\n> 3: Sharing leftover\r\n> 4: Ad placeholder in mobile\r\n> 5: Ad placeholder on iPhone\r\nUsername: `@Morku`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/moz3funz4tcgsoc4ssocco4sg8wgk04jur5n2xny6o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/55y42ideookcs84o88gscksws0gosko26zcv5ew35u.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/75zgho4900sgkw0sc04gko0kgs00gkofiokprv0h7c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/owczhgytkn4wc4o8skk8kg0kws0gc44cys8nciqtdc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/mlicvrywgjkwwk8wkwco4s88wok0okc2ezbel55qdc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.16.0 (4542)\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI, <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Disable WAP Push Message Routing Service, <br>Disable Windows Defender automatic samples submission, <br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard`, `DNS`, `Non-filtering`<br>filters: `AdGuard Home with AdGuard DNS filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/169653/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-31T09:39:43Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
