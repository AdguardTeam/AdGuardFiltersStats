Comment\r\n> If I go to this site with AdGuard enable I have to go through the \"Press and Hold\" to prove you're a human process every time.  With AdGuard disabled I don't have to do this.  This only started recently, in the past 2 weeks.  I want to be able to have AdGuard enabled to block ads on the site.  This has also been happening lately with www.walmart.com.
