This issue occurs consistently when the setting is turned on.\r\n> \r\n> #### Steps to Reproduce\r\n> 1. Open **AdGuard** and go to **Settings**.\r\n> 2. Navigate to the **Network** section.\r\n> 3. Enable the **\"Filter HTTPS\"** option.\r\n> 4. Observe that the **Sora and Project folders** disappear.\r\n> \r\n> #### Expected Behavior\r\n> The Sora and Project folders should remain visible and accessible even when **\"Filter HTTPS\"** is enabled.\r\n> \r\n> #### Actual Behavior\r\n> As soon as **\"Filter HTTPS\"** is enabled, the folders disappear.\r\n> \r\n> #### Additional Information\r\n> - **OS Version**: Win 11 pro Build 26100.3476\r\n> - **AdGuard Version**:  7.20.2 (4988)\r\n> \r\n> #### Workaround\r\n> Disabling **\"Filter HTTPS\"** restores the Sora and Project folders, but this is not an ideal solution as HTTPS filtering is needed.  \r\n> Additionally, adding **chatgpt.com** to the **User Filter** does not resolve the issue.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\nUsername: `@AbhishekBasnet`\r\n\r\n###

This issue occurs consistently when the setting is turned on.\r\n> \r\n> #### Steps to Reproduce\r\n> 1. Open **AdGuard** and go to **Settings**.\r\n> 2. Navigate to the **Network** section.\r\n> 3. Enable the **\"Filter HTTPS\"** option.\r\n> 4. Observe that the **Sora and Project folders** disappear.\r\n> \r\n> #### Expected Behavior\r\n> The Sora and Project folders should remain visible and accessible even when **\"Filter HTTPS\"** is enabled.\r\n> \r\n> #### Actual Behavior\r\n> As soon as **\"Filter HTTPS\"** is enabled, the folders disappear.\r\n> \r\n> #### Additional Information\r\n> - **OS Version**: Win 11 pro Build 26100.3476\r\n> - **AdGuard Version**:  7.20.2 (4988)\r\n> \r\n> #### Workaround\r\n> Disabling **\"Filter HTTPS\"** restores the Sora and Project folders, but this is not an ideal solution as HTTPS filtering is needed.  \r\n> Additionally, adding **chatgpt.com** to the **User Filter** does not resolve the issue.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\nUsername: `@AbhishekBasnet`\r\n\r\n###

This issue occurs consistently when the setting is turned on.\r\n> \r\n> #### Steps to Reproduce\r\n> 1. Open **AdGuard** and go to **Settings**.\r\n> 2. Navigate to the **Network** section.\r\n> 3. Enable the **\"Filter HTTPS\"** option.\r\n> 4. Observe that the **Sora and Project folders** disappear.\r\n> \r\n> #### Expected Behavior\r\n> The Sora and Project folders should remain visible and accessible even when **\"Filter HTTPS\"** is enabled.\r\n> \r\n> #### Actual Behavior\r\n> As soon as **\"Filter HTTPS\"** is enabled, the folders disappear.\r\n> \r\n> #### Additional Information\r\n> - **OS Version**: Win 11 pro Build 26100.3476\r\n> - **AdGuard Version**:  7.20.2 (4988)\r\n> \r\n> #### Workaround\r\n> Disabling **\"Filter HTTPS\"** restores the Sora and Project folders, but this is not an ideal solution as HTTPS filtering is needed.  \r\n> Additionally, adding **chatgpt.com** to the **User Filter** does not resolve the issue.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\nUsername: `@AbhishekBasnet`\r\n\r\n###

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://chatgpt.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchatgpt.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> ### Bug Report: Sora and Project Folders Disappear When Enabling \"Filter HTTPS\" in AdGuard\r\n> \r\n> #### Description\r\n> When enabling the **\"Filter HTTPS\"** option in **Network settings** of AdGuard, the **Sora and Project folders** disappear. This issue occurs consistently when the setting is turned on.\r\n> \r\n> #### Steps to Reproduce\r\n> 1. Open **AdGuard** and go to **Settings**.\r\n> 2. Navigate to the **Network** section.\r\n> 3. Enable the **\"Filter HTTPS\"** option.\r\n> 4. Observe that the **Sora and Project folders** disappear.\r\n> \r\n> #### Expected Behavior\r\n> The Sora and Project folders should remain visible and accessible even when **\"Filter HTTPS\"** is enabled.\r\n> \r\n> #### Actual Behavior\r\n> As soon as **\"Filter HTTPS\"** is enabled, the folders disappear.\r\n> \r\n> #### Additional Information\r\n> - **OS Version**: Win 11 pro Build 26100.3476\r\n> - **AdGuard Version**:  7.20.2 (4988)\r\n> \r\n> #### Workaround\r\n> Disabling **\"Filter HTTPS\"** restores the Sora and Project folders, but this is not an ideal solution as HTTPS filtering is needed.  \r\n> Additionally, adding **chatgpt.com** to the **User Filter** does not resolve the issue.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\nUsername: `@AbhishekBasnet`\r\n\r\n###

our URL shortening service domain, s.ee, has been blocked by AdGuard DNS. We take the safety and security of our service very seriously and have implemented comprehensive measures to ensure it is not used for phishing or malicious purposes. Specifically:\r\n> \r\n> We actively monitor all URLs generated by our users daily. If we identify any phishing or illegal content, the associated user accounts are immediately banned, and the malicious URLs removed.\r\n> \r\n> We synchronize daily with well-known phishing databases to proactively block malicious URLs and domains, minimizing any possibility of abuse.\r\n> \r\n> We handle and investigate user and third-party reports of misuse promptly. Verified malicious links and responsible accounts are blocked swiftly upon confirmation.\r\n> \r\n> Given our proactive and diligent approach, we kindly request a review of our domain (s.ee) and guidance on the necessary steps to have it removed from AdGuard DNS's blocked list.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for your prompt attention and assistance.\r\nUsername: `@showfom`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/m5n9r4etghsw40cgg84c4k4kw840gc88zwz1lvrlv4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | Windows 11\r\nBrowser: | Firefox","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/200954/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-03-17T12:11:48Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
