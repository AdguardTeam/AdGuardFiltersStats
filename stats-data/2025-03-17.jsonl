This issue occurs consistently when the setting is turned on.\r\n> \r\n> #### Steps to Reproduce\r\n> 1. Open **AdGuard** and go to **Settings**.\r\n> 2. Navigate to the **Network** section.\r\n> 3. Enable the **\"Filter HTTPS\"** option.\r\n> 4. Observe that the **Sora and Project folders** disappear.\r\n> \r\n> #### Expected Behavior\r\n> The Sora and Project folders should remain visible and accessible even when **\"Filter HTTPS\"** is enabled.\r\n> \r\n> #### Actual Behavior\r\n> As soon as **\"Filter HTTPS\"** is enabled, the folders disappear.\r\n> \r\n> #### Additional Information\r\n> - **OS Version**: Win 11 pro Build 26100.3476\r\n> - **AdGuard Version**:  7.20.2 (4988)\r\n> \r\n> #### Workaround\r\n> Disabling **\"Filter HTTPS\"** restores the Sora and Project folders, but this is not an ideal solution as HTTPS filtering is needed.  \r\n> Additionally, adding **chatgpt.com** to the **User Filter** does not resolve the issue.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\nUsername: `@AbhishekBasnet`\r\n\r\n###

This issue occurs consistently when the setting is turned on.\r\n> \r\n> #### Steps to Reproduce\r\n> 1. Open **AdGuard** and go to **Settings**.\r\n> 2. Navigate to the **Network** section.\r\n> 3. Enable the **\"Filter HTTPS\"** option.\r\n> 4. Observe that the **Sora and Project folders** disappear.\r\n> \r\n> #### Expected Behavior\r\n> The Sora and Project folders should remain visible and accessible even when **\"Filter HTTPS\"** is enabled.\r\n> \r\n> #### Actual Behavior\r\n> As soon as **\"Filter HTTPS\"** is enabled, the folders disappear.\r\n> \r\n> #### Additional Information\r\n> - **OS Version**: Win 11 pro Build 26100.3476\r\n> - **AdGuard Version**:  7.20.2 (4988)\r\n> \r\n> #### Workaround\r\n> Disabling **\"Filter HTTPS\"** restores the Sora and Project folders, but this is not an ideal solution as HTTPS filtering is needed.  \r\n> Additionally, adding **chatgpt.com** to the **User Filter** does not resolve the issue.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\nUsername: `@AbhishekBasnet`\r\n\r\n###
