Comment\r\n> Auf vielen Seiten reicht es nicht aus, den Adblocker für 30 Sekunden zu deaktivieren. Man muss den ADGUARD-Client komplett deaktivieren und dann den Browser neu starten.

Upon further investigation, it appears that most (all?) newspapers that run on the Gannet platform are affected. This includes large newspapers like USA Today and AZ Central as well as many many others. Here's a partial list of the ones I tested that were affected. \r\n> - free.com\r\n> - usatoday.com\r\n> - palmbeachdailynews.com\r\n> - indystar.com\r\n> - azcentral.com\r\n> \r\n> For a full list, see this wikipedia article that lists all of the newspaper assets owned and operated by Gannet. \r\n> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_Gannett\r\n> \r\n> I tested this using my normal setup (Safari on Mac 15.5 with other extension running) as well as in Safari mode with no other extensions running. When I disabled Adguard for the site via the extension, the sites started working again as normal. \r\nUsername: `@mattcolf`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/8yj2vnqw190cs0ocockgk0cs40kw0s8b9zpvmrd0uo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.22\r\nSystem version: | Mac OS 15.5\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection\r\nOther extensions used: | Privacy.com, 1Password, Rakuten, and Kagi extensions.

However, it seems that one employee, who appears to be Korean, is deliberately delaying issues related to Korean websites. Some of my reports have not been processed for a long time, so I checked, and it was clear that he was intentionally skipping Korean site issues that were assigned or about to be assigned to him, and only handling other tasks. I heard that he is Korean, so why is he causing trouble for fellow Koreans? I am curious as to why this is happening.\r\nUsername: `@kaizo`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/1phk0vch95og0kwc8gc0owcgkw88k006bdu73jt9tc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.79 mv2 \r\nSystem version: | windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>List-KR\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-27T15:57:46Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> I heard that there are Korean employees at AdGuard. However, it seems that one employee, who appears to be Korean, is deliberately delaying issues related to Korean websites. Some of my reports have not been processed for a long time, so I checked, and it was clear that he was intentionally skipping Korean site issues that were assigned or about to be assigned to him, and only handling other tasks. I heard that he is Korean, so why is he causing trouble for fellow Koreans? I am curious as to why this is happening.\r\nUsername: `@kaizo`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/1phk0vch95og0kwc8gc0owcgkw88k006bdu73jt9tc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.79 mv2 \r\nSystem version: | windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>List-KR\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/206346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-27T19:21:52Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
