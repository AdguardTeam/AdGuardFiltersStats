Сначала я отключил dns-фильтры, которые идут по умолчанию в DNS вроде заработало, но до следующей перезагрузки пк, потом я отключил DNS в AdGuard вообще и это помогло, но нельзя же сидеть без защиты... На андроид 14 такая же ситуация и после отключения DNS, тоже работает нормально.\r\n>  \r\n> Настройки AdGuard получает от AdGuard Home и адрес AdGuard Home настроен еще на нескольких устройствах включающих роутер, когда я отключаю простой AdGuard, тогда все работает нормально, через роутер. Т.К. через роутер все работает, я подозреваю, что это все-таки простой AdGuard.\r\n>  \r\n> Все исключения добавлены и в Home и в AdGuard и все равно не работает.\r\nUsername: `@filisdiez`\r\n\r\n###
