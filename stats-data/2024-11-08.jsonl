Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://open.spotify.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> AdGuard has some issues with blocking ads on Spotify's web client. It just freezes the ad and doesn't skip. It's stuck on an indefinite hold and you aren't able to play other songs/playlists either unless you reload the whole page. But that beats the purpose of skipping through advertisements and playing the next song seamlessly. I've been noticing this issue since last month.

I am not using Adguard, I am using Adguard's filter lists with uBlock Origin. The problem comes with the \"AdGuard ‚Äì Ads\" list. It has a cosmetic filter for _##img[width=\"240\"][height=\"400\"]_ which blocs few images on the website. One example can be seen at https://vndb.org/v21289/cv#cv with the main page's cover being hidden and two in the tab as seen in my uploaded screenshot.\r\nI don't see how this is relevant to ads as there are no ads on the website.\r\n\r\n2.

Maybe with a debugger over USB, but I was hoping you may know how to find it.\n\n### Additional information\n\nI have attempted blocking the banner using the uBO element picker, but unfortunately the resulting selector was too broad, and was blocking other elements too, like the menus that appear when the \"3 dot\" or the share menu is opened for a post.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192278/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2465645170","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192278#issuecomment-2465645170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/192278","id":2465645170,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86S9sJy","user":{"login":"mpeter50","id":83356418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMzU2NDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83356418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpeter50","html_url":"https://github.com/mpeter50","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpeter50/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpeter50/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpeter50/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpeter50/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpeter50/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpeter50/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpeter50/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpeter50/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpeter50/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-08T19:54:07Z","updated_at":"2024-11-08T19:54:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The hiding the banner seems to be possible with the following uBO cosmetic filter:\r\n```\r\n:not(div.dialog-screen) > .bottom.fixed-container.m\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like this as an uBO custom filter rule:\r\n```\r\nm.facebook.com##:not(div.dialog-screen) > .bottom.fixed-container.m\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2465645170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-11-08T19:54:09Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
