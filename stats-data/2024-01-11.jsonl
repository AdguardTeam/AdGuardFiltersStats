Though this happens at least once when you are not using the your device for hours and the issue will not reappear until tomorrow, but the fact that upon tapping the in-site button will open and send you to another site is very annoying.\r\n> \r\n> Is there any AdGuard filter that I should have enabled or is this a AdGuard filter that needs updating?\r\n> \r\n> Let me know when there is an update.\r\nUsername: `@Ian Chen`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/r1mqmi5j73ko8gw4gscsgosw08sow88eghmpfyzzbs.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.1\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`, `Default`, `(Regular)`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170096/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1886095140","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170096#issuecomment-1886095140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170096","id":1886095140,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85wa4ck","user":{"login":"IC3295","id":142564994,"node_id":"U_kgDOCH9egg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142564994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295","html_url":"https://github.com/IC3295","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-11T02:21:46Z","updated_at":"2024-01-11T02:21:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![IMG_1635](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/142564994/d7d09983-4a32-473a-b35a-3e3d872e2bea)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1886095140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-11T02:21:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Though this happens at least once when you are not using the your device for hours and the issue will not reappear until tomorrow, but the fact that upon tapping the in-site button will open and send you to another site is very annoying.\r\n> \r\n> Is there any AdGuard filter that I should have enabled or is this a AdGuard filter that needs updating?\r\n> \r\n> Let me know when there is an update.\r\nUsername: `@Ian Chen`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/r1mqmi5j73ko8gw4gscsgosw08sow88eghmpfyzzbs.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.1\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`, `Default`, `(Regular)`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170096/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1887119318","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170096#issuecomment-1887119318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170096","id":1887119318,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85weyfW","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-11T13:01:30Z","updated_at":"2024-01-11T13:01:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hm.

Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\r\n- [X] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\r\n- [X] This is not an ad/bug report.\r\n\r\n## Problem description\r\n\r\n* Be a URL with a few rather classic junk query params (`at_medium`, `at_campaign`, etc) — **_but preceded by a `#`_**:\r\n```\r\nhttps://www.france.tv/films/5606040-une-affaire-privee.html#at_medium=5&at_campaign_group=2&at_campaign=integrale&at_offre=1&at_send_date=20240106&at_recipient_id=459386-1664366309-2d5f2440\r\n```\r\n* Be a custom filter rule (which works all right as long as the query params are preceded by a `?` or an `&`):\r\n```\r\n||*$removeparam=/^(at|ul|utm)_/\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWith the aforementioned rule being set, the URL should be rendered as\r\n```\r\nhttps://www.france.tv/films/5606040-une-affaire-privee.html\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe URL remains unchanged. On the other hand, the filter works all right as long as the query params are preceded by a `?` or an `&`.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nNot sure, but probably the `^` set of separator characters (separator marks) should also include the hash (`#`).\r\n\r\nExcerpt from the KB:\r\n\r\n> ### [Special characters](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#basic-rules-special-characters)\r\n> (...)\r\n> - **`^`** — a separator character mark. Separator character is any character, but a letter, a digit, or one of the following: `_` `-` `.` `%`. In this example separator characters are shown in bold: `http:`**`//`**`example.com`**`/?`**`t=1`**`&`**`t2=t3`.

Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] I checked the documentation and found no answer;\r\n- [X] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed;\r\n- [X] This is not an ad/bug report.\r\n\r\n## Problem description\r\n\r\n* Be a URL with a few rather classic junk query params (`at_medium`, `at_campaign`, etc) — **_but preceded by a `#`_**:\r\n```\r\nhttps://www.france.tv/films/5606040-une-affaire-privee.html#at_medium=5&at_campaign_group=2&at_campaign=integrale&at_offre=1&at_send_date=20240106&at_recipient_id=459386-1664366309-2d5f2440\r\n```\r\n* Be a custom filter rule (which works all right as long as the query params are preceded by a `?` or an `&`):\r\n```\r\n||*$removeparam=/^(at|ul|utm)_/\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWith the aforementioned rule being set, the URL should be rendered as\r\n```\r\nhttps://www.france.tv/films/5606040-une-affaire-privee.html\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe URL remains unchanged. On the other hand, the filter works all right as long as the query params are preceded by a `?` or an `&`.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nNot sure, but probably the `^` set of separator characters (separator marks) should also include the hash (`#`).\r\n\r\nExcerpt from the KB:\r\n\r\n> ### [Special characters](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#basic-rules-special-characters)\r\n> (...)\r\n> - **`^`** — a separator character mark. Separator character is any character, but a letter, a digit, or one of the following: `_` `-` `.` `%`. In this example separator characters are shown in bold: `http:`**`//`**`example.com`**`/?`**`t=1`**`&`**`t2=t3`. The end of the address is also accepted as separator.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170146/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1887035984","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170146#issuecomment-1887035984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170146","id":1887035984,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85weeJQ","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-11T12:14:49Z","updated_at":"2024-01-11T12:14:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Parameters after `#` are not send.\r\n![image](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/8361299/61a91091-f7b2-48b0-a9ec-609b267f91ea)\r\n\r\nWhere did you get this link?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1887035984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-11T12:14:51Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
