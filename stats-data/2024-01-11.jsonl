Issue URL (Annoyance)\r\n [http://aniwave.to](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Faniwave.to)\r\n### Comment\r\n> This happens when upon entering the site and tapping the ‘Go to Homepage’ button, it will open another site that is similar to the site itself. Though this happens at least once when you are not using the your device for hours and the issue will not reappear until tomorrow, but the fact that upon tapping the in-site button will open and send you to another site is very annoying.\r\n> \r\n> Is there any AdGuard filter that I should have enabled or is this a AdGuard filter that needs updating?\r\n> \r\n> Let me know when there is an update.\r\nUsername: `@Ian Chen`\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/r1mqmi5j73ko8gw4gscsgosw08sow88eghmpfyzzbs.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.1\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`, `Default`, `(Regular)`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/dns/filter_1_ios.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170096/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1886095140","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170096#issuecomment-1886095140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/170096","id":1886095140,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85wa4ck","user":{"login":"IC3295","id":142564994,"node_id":"U_kgDOCH9egg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142564994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295","html_url":"https://github.com/IC3295","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IC3295/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-11T02:21:46Z","updated_at":"2024-01-11T02:21:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![IMG_1635](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/assets/142564994/d7d09983-4a32-473a-b35a-3e3d872e2bea)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1886095140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-11T02:21:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
