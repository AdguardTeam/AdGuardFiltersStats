The list strips it out on specific domains only (see for example specific.txt at [L22](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/TrackParamFilter/sections/specific.txt#L22), [L47](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/TrackParamFilter/sections/specific.txt#L47), etc.)\n\nIs this intended? Have you noticed that stripping out `ref` by default breaks too many websites?
