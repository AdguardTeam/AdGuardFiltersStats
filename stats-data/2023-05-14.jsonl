@mariankubacka\r\n> Hello guys, I use Mac OS X & I’ve tried to use AdGuard only for Safari, because I work in marketing and I use my Chrome browser for Google Ads, which doesn’t work correctly with launched Ads blocker. \r\n> \r\n> So I adjusted AdGuard, in Preferences Settings - Network -> Applications -> Uncheck Google Chrome, I've also tried to delete applications from the list. Then I've tried use Chrome Extension only & use whitelist for URL ads.google.com. \r\n> \r\n> But it doesn’t work correctly, I have broken images f.e. on the Google Ads dashboard and so. Can you help me with settings or advanced settings?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/xp6CC1H.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/lxiHW2m.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.55\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150300/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1546987164","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150300#issuecomment-1546987164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150300","id":1546987164,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85cNSac","user":{"login":"mariankubacka","id":132758834,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-m9Mg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132758834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka","html_url":"https://github.com/mariankubacka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-14T19:48:27Z","updated_at":"2023-05-14T19:48:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @mariankubacka Hi.

@mariankubacka\r\n> Hello guys, I use Mac OS X & I’ve tried to use AdGuard only for Safari, because I work in marketing and I use my Chrome browser for Google Ads, which doesn’t work correctly with launched Ads blocker. \r\n> \r\n> So I adjusted AdGuard, in Preferences Settings - Network -> Applications -> Uncheck Google Chrome, I've also tried to delete applications from the list. Then I've tried use Chrome Extension only & use whitelist for URL ads.google.com. \r\n> \r\n> But it doesn’t work correctly, I have broken images f.e. on the Google Ads dashboard and so. Can you help me with settings or advanced settings?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/xp6CC1H.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/lxiHW2m.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.55\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150300/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1546990631","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150300#issuecomment-1546990631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/150300","id":1546990631,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85cNTQn","user":{"login":"mariankubacka","id":132758834,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-m9Mg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132758834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka","html_url":"https://github.com/mariankubacka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariankubacka/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-14T20:08:51Z","updated_at":"2023-05-14T20:08:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> So can works only:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> ||tpc.googlesyncdication.com^$badfilter\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> or\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> @@||tpc.googlesyncdication.com^$important\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> due in source column I don't `ads.google.com` or `Safari`/`Chrome` as process.\r\n\r\nThanks, I've found another DNS rules yet, but after unblocking it works fine now :) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1546990631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-14T20:08:52Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
