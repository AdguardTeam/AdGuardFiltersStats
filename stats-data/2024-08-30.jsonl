ATTENTION\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly.

maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/commit/6f2058b21f0363d91bb0bab7e52378d2632f4fe6\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\n#### If possible, a screenshot of a page or application should not be cropped too much. Otherwise, it is not always clear where the element is located\r\n\r\n0. **DO NOT** upload screenshots with sexually explicit material on GitHub directly.\\\r\n Instead, upload it to a third-party image hosting and post the link to it without preview (!) here.\\\r\n Also, mention if the link leads to NSFW content;\r\n\r\n1. Your comment\r\n\r\nOther than `?id=GTM-`, `.js?st=` is used. Ofc we can't add such a generic rule (false positive example `https://www.languefrancaise.net/dev6/pub/pmwiki-utils.js?st=1723143120`) and unfortunately, there seems to be no common subdomain like `://gtm`. We have to use regex to block them.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are
