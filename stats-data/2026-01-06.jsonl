Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmytotalconnectcomfort.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> This is the site I use to control my thermostat in my home so I need it to be working.  I've been through extensive troubleshooting to fix this over the past few weeks and I had to take my computer to a specialist for $80 to determine that the issue is caused by AdGuard.  I didn't think it was initially because I disabled AdGuard on this site and it still wouldn't load.  However, he pointed out that if I completely exit AdGuard, then the site will load properly.   My screenshots are of AdGuard still running on my computer, but with it disabled on the site, and the site will not load with \"ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED\".  The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

This is the site I use to control my thermostat in my home so I need it to be working.  I've been through extensive troubleshooting to fix this over the past few weeks and I had to take my computer to a specialist for $80 to determine that the issue is caused by AdGuard.  I didn't think it was initially because I disabled AdGuard on this site and it still wouldn't load.  However, he pointed out that if I completely exit AdGuard, then the site will load properly.   My screenshots are of AdGuard still running on my computer, but with it disabled on the site, and the site will not load with \"ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED\".  The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

This is the site I use to control my thermostat in my home so I need it to be working.  I've been through extensive troubleshooting to fix this over the past few weeks and I had to take my computer to a specialist for $80 to determine that the issue is caused by AdGuard.  I didn't think it was initially because I disabled AdGuard on this site and it still wouldn't load.  However, he pointed out that if I completely exit AdGuard, then the site will load properly.   My screenshots are of AdGuard still running on my computer, but with it disabled on the site, and the site will not load with \"ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED\".  The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmytotalconnectcomfort.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> This is the site I use to control my thermostat in my home so I need it to be working.  I've been through extensive troubleshooting to fix this over the past few weeks and I had to take my computer to a specialist for $80 to determine that the issue is caused by AdGuard.  I didn't think it was initially because I disabled AdGuard on this site and it still wouldn't load.  However, he pointed out that if I completely exit AdGuard, then the site will load properly.   My screenshots are of AdGuard still running on my computer, but with it disabled on the site, and the site will not load with \"ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED\".  The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

Comment\r\n> Every time I enter anything in Google docs or Google sheets and either switch tabs in the browser window or navigate to another window to check something, your extension DELETES the last few minutes worth of work from the doc or sheet. It's infuriating. And bizarre. I have turned off access to docs and sheets, it still happens. The only way to stop it is to completely disable your extension. Not cool! Also, not sharing a pic of a Google sheet that has info deleted because it won't help you, and would be a HIPAA violation. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/stmlw2esvascks4ookscs0sc0g4scgc7t8b8vdip2o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/so7vrkjiqxw4gw084kscs40o80w4oc41aa0067quac.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.2.800.9 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Chromium OS 14541.0.0`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nFilters last update: | December 29, 2025 at 12:00\r\nOther extensions used: | `None.

Comment\r\n> Every time I enter anything in Google docs or Google sheets and either switch tabs in the browser window or navigate to another window to check something, your extension DELETES the last few minutes worth of work from the doc or sheet. It's infuriating. And bizarre. I have turned off access to docs and sheets, it still happens. The only way to stop it is to completely disable your extension. Not cool! Also, not sharing a pic of a Google sheet that has info deleted because it won't help you, and would be a HIPAA violation. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/stmlw2esvascks4ookscs0sc0g4scgc7t8b8vdip2o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/so7vrkjiqxw4gw084kscs40o80w4oc41aa0067quac.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.2.800.9 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Chromium OS 14541.0.0`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nFilters last update: | December 29, 2025 at 12:00\r\nOther extensions used: | `None.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmytotalconnectcomfort.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> This is the site I use to control my thermostat in my home so I need it to be working.  I've been through extensive troubleshooting to fix this over the past few weeks and I had to take my computer to a specialist for $80 to determine that the issue is caused by AdGuard.  I didn't think it was initially because I disabled AdGuard on this site and it still wouldn't load.  However, he pointed out that if I completely exit AdGuard, then the site will load properly.   My screenshots are of AdGuard still running on my computer, but with it disabled on the site, and the site will not load with \"ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED\".  The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS (dns.adguard.com) cannot access naver.com domains. We received confirmation from AdGuard support that naver.com domains are not blocked.\r\n> \r\n> As a follow-up, we would like to provide additional details about the ongoing issue.\r\n> \r\n> **Issue Overview:**\r\n> We have recently received numerous reports from customers experiencing difficulties accessing Naver-related services through Android apps (Chrome, Google app, Naver app, etc.) when using AdGuard DNS. Based on customer inquiries and internal reproduction tests, we have confirmed that this issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS in conjunction with LG U+, a major network provider in South Korea.\r\n> \r\n> **Symptoms:**\r\n> * Various Naver services (Naver Search, Naver Shopping, Naver News, etc.) are inaccessible or fail to load properly\r\n>   > For example, when accessing \"m.naver.com\" through mobile Chrome or Google app, users encounter errors such as \"Unable to connect to the Internet\" or \"This site can't be reached\"\r\n>   > Web pages fail to load in browser apps, displaying ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED errors\r\n> * The issue is primarily reported by Android users\r\n> * The problem occurs intermittently (not continuously), sometimes lasting several minutes\r\n> * Our internal testing confirms the issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS with the LG U+ network\r\n>   > Configuration: Phone Settings > Connections > More connection settings > Private DNS > dns.adguard-dns.com (or dns.adguard.com)\r\n> \r\n> **Actions Taken:**\r\n> The Naver development team has contacted the LG U+ network team to investigate this issue further. We are reaching out to request AdGuard's cooperation as well, as this appears to be an interaction between AdGuard DNS and the LG U+ network that is affecting our users' ability to access Naver services.\r\n> \r\n> We appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/l12z5xty3tsk004k8000skoks8w80wsb2r994pz5r4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/16ho0xijiiw0g4w8gookogko4g4ss0kphwb4855j00.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/sy801lsz4000s8c0s0wgkwcc4s0wcg4dje2wixxao0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/eqnqnc2iq8g8g04cw8o0ksogcg8gg48lnokjgnjwzk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/iadqmo6ipq0wocgkcwggs8o0k8ggk40tpgtxpyimsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/oljxujs1sn4w8swck4okwgow4ssswk0e96d8hnp0f4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/tkvknvqico0gw4880gs0kcokg444woseo1nz2b8zfc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/6s32hb49exgc48k8kcowg04ogowgcowbz4xhkisev4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Android 16`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3712950169","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474#issuecomment-3712950169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474","id":3712950169,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87dTx-Z","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-06T03:18:45Z","updated_at":"2026-01-06T03:18:45Z","body":"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b6b4711-7c0d-42d3-b62a-66943f40dadf\n\nWhat is wrong?

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://m.naver.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.naver.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Hello, this is the Naver Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS (dns.adguard.com) cannot access naver.com domains.

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://m.naver.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.naver.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Hello, this is the Naver Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS (dns.adguard.com) cannot access naver.com domains. We received confirmation from AdGuard support that naver.com domains are not blocked.\r\n> \r\n> As a follow-up, we would like to provide additional details about the ongoing issue.\r\n> \r\n> **Issue Overview:**\r\n> We have recently received numerous reports from customers experiencing difficulties accessing Naver-related services through Android apps (Chrome, Google app, Naver app, etc.) when using AdGuard DNS. Based on customer inquiries and internal reproduction tests, we have confirmed that this issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS in conjunction with LG U+, a major network provider in South Korea.\r\n> \r\n> **Symptoms:**\r\n> * Various Naver services (Naver Search, Naver Shopping, Naver News, etc.) are inaccessible or fail to load properly\r\n>   > For example, when accessing \"m.naver.com\" through mobile Chrome or Google app, users encounter errors such as \"Unable to connect to the Internet\" or \"This site can't be reached\"\r\n>   > Web pages fail to load in browser apps, displaying ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED errors\r\n> * The issue is primarily reported by Android users\r\n> * The problem occurs intermittently (not continuously), sometimes lasting several minutes\r\n> * Our internal testing confirms the issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS with the LG U+ network\r\n>   > Configuration: Phone Settings > Connections > More connection settings > Private DNS > dns.adguard-dns.com (or dns.adguard.com)\r\n> \r\n> **Actions Taken:**\r\n> The Naver development team has contacted the LG U+ network team to investigate this issue further. We are reaching out to request AdGuard's cooperation as well, as this appears to be an interaction between AdGuard DNS and the LG U+ network that is affecting our users' ability to access Naver services.\r\n> \r\n> We appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/l12z5xty3tsk004k8000skoks8w80wsb2r994pz5r4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/16ho0xijiiw0g4w8gookogko4g4ss0kphwb4855j00.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/sy801lsz4000s8c0s0wgkwcc4s0wcg4dje2wixxao0.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/eqnqnc2iq8g8g04cw8o0ksogcg8gg48lnokjgnjwzk.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/iadqmo6ipq0wocgkcwggs8o0k8ggk40tpgtxpyimsg.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/oljxujs1sn4w8swck4okwgow4ssswk0e96d8hnp0f4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/tkvknvqico0gw4880gs0kcokg444woseo1nz2b8zfc.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/6s32hb49exgc48k8kcowg04ogowgcowbz4xhkisev4.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard DNS\r\nDNS setup: | Device or router settings\r\nDNS server: | AdGuard DNS Default server\r\nSystem version: | `Android 16`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3713399379","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474#issuecomment-3713399379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/221474","id":3713399379,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87dVfpT","user":{"login":"piquark6046","id":98787049,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeNe6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98787049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046","html_url":"https://github.com/piquark6046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piquark6046/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-06T07:02:13Z","updated_at":"2026-01-06T07:02:13Z","body":"The screencast attachements are forwarded to the Slack.

Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS

Development Team.\r\n> \r\n> One of our team members previously contacted AdGuard support regarding an issue with Naver services when using AdGuard DNS, reporting that Android users with AdGuard DNS (dns.adguard.com) cannot access naver.com domains. We received confirmation from AdGuard support that naver.com domains are not blocked.\r\n> \r\n> As a follow-up, we would like to provide additional details about the ongoing issue.\r\n> \r\n> **Issue Overview:**\r\n> We have recently received numerous reports from customers experiencing difficulties accessing Naver-related services through Android apps (Chrome, Google app, Naver app, etc.) when using AdGuard DNS. Based on customer inquiries and internal reproduction tests, we have confirmed that this issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS in conjunction with LG U+, a major network provider in South Korea.\r\n> \r\n> **Symptoms:**\r\n> * Various Naver services (Naver Search, Naver Shopping, Naver News, etc.) are inaccessible or fail to load properly\r\n>   > For example, when accessing \"m.naver.com\" through mobile Chrome or Google app, users encounter errors such as \"Unable to connect to the Internet\" or \"This site can't be reached\"\r\n>   > Web pages fail to load in browser apps, displaying ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED errors\r\n> * The issue is primarily reported by Android users\r\n> * The problem occurs intermittently (not continuously), sometimes lasting several minutes\r\n> * Our internal testing confirms the issue occurs specifically when using AdGuard DNS with the LG U+ network\r\n>   > Configuration: Phone Settings > Connections > More connection settings > Private DNS > dns.adguard-dns.com (or dns.adguard.com)\r\n> \r\n> **Actions Taken:**\r\n> The Naver development team has contacted the LG U+ network team to investigate this issue further. We are reaching out to request AdGuard's cooperation as well, as this appears to be an interaction between AdGuard DNS and the LG U+ network that is affecting our users' ability to access Naver services.\r\n> \r\n> We appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmytotalconnectcomfort.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> This is the site I use to control my thermostat in my home so I need it to be working.  I've been through extensive troubleshooting to fix this over the past few weeks and I had to take my computer to a specialist for $80 to determine that the issue is caused by AdGuard.  I didn't think it was initially because I disabled AdGuard on this site and it still wouldn't load.  However, he pointed out that if I completely exit AdGuard, then the site will load properly.   My screenshots are of AdGuard still running on my computer, but with it disabled on the site, and the site will not load with \"ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED\".  The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

Вводные:\r\n> Дано:\r\n> Смартфон с Android 13 + установлено положение Lampa (не помню откуда скачивал apk для установки lampa) (cub.red) + установлено Adguard for Android (последняя версия).  \r\n>  \r\n> В лампе установлен плагин онлайн просмотра https://nb557.github.io/plugins/online_mod.js\r\n> При включенной защити Adguard (возможно связано включенной dns-защитой) в этом плагине отламывается функционал авторизации в  HDREZKA и изменяется сам внешний вид авторизации. Без авторизации просмотр с балансера HDREZKA невозможна. Если отключить защиту вид настройки меняется, появляется пункт \"заполнить куки для HDREZKA\", после ввода логина/пароля заполняются эти куки и происходит вход в аккаунт HDREZKA и доступ к просмотру.  \r\n>  \r\n> Также при включении защиты режутся некоторые настройки плеера в приложении (выбор встроенного в приложение плеера или плеера Android. Пропадает пункт \"закрыть приложение\"  из главного окна настроек. \r\n> \r\n> по наблюдением, adguard чего то ломает, из-за чего lampa для Android считает себя веб версией, которая запускается в любом браузере вводом адреса lampa.mx. В следствии этого отсутствуют все настройки присущие Android (выбор вместо встроенного плеера lampa любого плеера установленного на Android) \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n

Вводные:\r\n> Дано:\r\n> Смартфон с Android 13 + установлено положение Lampa (не помню откуда скачивал apk для установки lampa) (cub.red) + установлено Adguard for Android (последняя версия).  \r\n>  \r\n> В лампе установлен плагин онлайн просмотра https://nb557.github.io/plugins/online_mod.js\r\n> При включенной защити Adguard (возможно связано включенной dns-защитой) в этом плагине отламывается функционал авторизации в  HDREZKA и изменяется сам внешний вид авторизации. Без авторизации просмотр с балансера HDREZKA невозможна. Если отключить защиту вид настройки меняется, появляется пункт \"заполнить куки для HDREZKA\", после ввода логина/пароля заполняются эти куки и происходит вход в аккаунт HDREZKA и доступ к просмотру.  \r\n>  \r\n> Также при включении защиты режутся некоторые настройки плеера в приложении (выбор встроенного в приложение плеера или плеера Android. Пропадает пункт \"закрыть приложение\"  из главного окна настроек. \r\n> \r\n> по наблюдением, adguard чего то ломает, из-за чего lampa для Android считает себя веб версией, которая запускается в любом браузере вводом адреса lampa.mx. В следствии этого отсутствуют все настройки присущие Android (выбор вместо встроенного плеера lampa любого плеера установленного на Android) \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n
