Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmytotalconnectcomfort.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> This is the site I use to control my thermostat in my home so I need it to be working.  I've been through extensive troubleshooting to fix this over the past few weeks and I had to take my computer to a specialist for $80 to determine that the issue is caused by AdGuard.  I didn't think it was initially because I disabled AdGuard on this site and it still wouldn't load.  However, he pointed out that if I completely exit AdGuard, then the site will load properly.   My screenshots are of AdGuard still running on my computer, but with it disabled on the site, and the site will not load with \"ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED\".  The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###
