Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmytotalconnectcomfort.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> This is the site I use to control my thermostat in my home so I need it to be working.  I've been through extensive troubleshooting to fix this over the past few weeks and I had to take my computer to a specialist for $80 to determine that the issue is caused by AdGuard.  I didn't think it was initially because I disabled AdGuard on this site and it still wouldn't load.  However, he pointed out that if I completely exit AdGuard, then the site will load properly.   My screenshots are of AdGuard still running on my computer, but with it disabled on the site, and the site will not load with \"ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED\".  The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

This is the site I use to control my thermostat in my home so I need it to be working.  I've been through extensive troubleshooting to fix this over the past few weeks and I had to take my computer to a specialist for $80 to determine that the issue is caused by AdGuard.  I didn't think it was initially because I disabled AdGuard on this site and it still wouldn't load.  However, he pointed out that if I completely exit AdGuard, then the site will load properly.   My screenshots are of AdGuard still running on my computer, but with it disabled on the site, and the site will not load with \"ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED\".  The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

I didn't think it was initially because I disabled AdGuard on this site and it still wouldn't load.  However, he pointed out that if I completely exit AdGuard, then the site will load properly.   My screenshots are of AdGuard still running on my computer, but with it disabled on the site, and the site will not load with \"ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED\".  The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

This is the site I use to control my thermostat in my home so I need it to be working.  I've been through extensive troubleshooting to fix this over the past few weeks and I had to take my computer to a specialist for $80 to determine that the issue is caused by AdGuard.  I didn't think it was initially because I disabled AdGuard on this site and it still wouldn't load.  However, he pointed out that if I completely exit AdGuard, then the site will load properly.   My screenshots are of AdGuard still running on my computer, but with it disabled on the site, and the site will not load with \"ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED\".  The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmytotalconnectcomfort.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> This is the site I use to control my thermostat in my home so I need it to be working.  I've been through extensive troubleshooting to fix this over the past few weeks and I had to take my computer to a specialist for $80 to determine that the issue is caused by AdGuard.  I didn't think it was initially because I disabled AdGuard on this site and it still wouldn't load.  However, he pointed out that if I completely exit AdGuard, then the site will load properly.   My screenshots are of AdGuard still running on my computer, but with it disabled on the site, and the site will not load with \"ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED\".  The second screenshot is after completely exiting AdGuard and not allowing it to run in the background and the site works normally.  \r\n```\r\nUsername: @JackLGM\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

Comment\r\n> Every time I enter anything in Google docs or Google sheets and either switch tabs in the browser window or navigate to another window to check something, your extension DELETES the last few minutes worth of work from the doc or sheet. It's infuriating. And bizarre. I have turned off access to docs and sheets, it still happens. The only way to stop it is to completely disable your extension. Not cool! Also, not sharing a pic of a Google sheet that has info deleted because it won't help you, and would be a HIPAA violation. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/stmlw2esvascks4ookscs0sc0g4scgc7t8b8vdip2o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/so7vrkjiqxw4gw084kscs40o80w4oc41aa0067quac.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.2.800.9 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Chromium OS 14541.0.0`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nFilters last update: | December 29, 2025 at 12:00\r\nOther extensions used: | `None.

Comment\r\n> Every time I enter anything in Google docs or Google sheets and either switch tabs in the browser window or navigate to another window to check something, your extension DELETES the last few minutes worth of work from the doc or sheet. It's infuriating. And bizarre. I have turned off access to docs and sheets, it still happens. The only way to stop it is to completely disable your extension. Not cool! Also, not sharing a pic of a Google sheet that has info deleted because it won't help you, and would be a HIPAA violation. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/stmlw2esvascks4ookscs0sc0g4scgc7t8b8vdip2o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/sitereports/so7vrkjiqxw4gw084kscs40o80w4oc41aa0067quac.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.2.800.9 MV3\r\nSystem version: | `Chromium OS 14541.0.0`\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nFilters last update: | December 29, 2025 at 12:00\r\nOther extensions used: | `None.
