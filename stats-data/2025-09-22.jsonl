I have a system that crawls top domains and collects browser API usage data. Building on prior research that measures entropy exposed by browser APIs, the system estimates the entropy gathered by each script. Using this approach, I got an extensive list of scripts that are suspicious for browser fingerprinting, like scripts I reported `https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20author%3Ajsu6`. I wonder if there is any way I can contribute this list to AdgraudTeam without reporting them individually? I am glad to answer any questions related to it. \n\nAlso, for the scripts I reported `https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20author%3Ajsu6`, I saw some of them are still open. Is there any reason why they are still open rather than closed as false positives or resolved?\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nNA\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/3318660880","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039#issuecomment-3318660880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/213039","id":3318660880,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM87Fzr8Q","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-22T12:19:47Z","updated_at":"2025-09-22T12:19:47Z","body":"I think it would be better for you to publish the results of your work on your account.
