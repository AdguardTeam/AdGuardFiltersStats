apps, it's not quite the same. \r\n> \r\n> I'm not going to name all of the apps I'm using, but here are a few that are flooded with ads lately: citymapper, booking, sncf-connect (french railway company), Grindr, aliexpress, Amazon, prime video, leboncoin (french eBay)...\r\n> \r\n> I didn't do anything special nor change settings.\r\n> \r\n> Any help is more than welcome!\r\nUsername:

already, it seems that adguard doesn't block much within the apps on my Pixel 7A.\r\n> \r\n> It works flawlessly on chrome (except for the \"sponsored\" links that won't disappear. \r\n> But with the apps, it's not quite the same. \r\n> \r\n> I'm not going to name all of the apps I'm using, but here are a few that are flooded with ads lately: citymapper, booking, sncf-connect (french railway company), Grindr, aliexpress, Amazon, prime video, leboncoin (french eBay)...\r\n> \r\n> I didn't do anything special nor change settings.\r\n> \r\n> Any help is more than welcome!\r\nUsername:
