changing as +1, if it does not open, try 201 or 202. The site contains banner ads and pre-roll ads. It is simple to block them, but what I want to ask is that when I block the pre-roll ad video with the `inattvhd200.xyz###video-before` filter, when I click on it to open another match broadcast from the right side, the warning to wait for the ad to end appears. What kind of filter can be used to prevent this?\r\nUsername: `@punisher018`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/pb7gtfo3m8gckkwgk8cw0ogg00c00go4fx6p15ez9y.jpg?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v4.3.13\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880)\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdBlockID","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175056/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2009112317","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175056#issuecomment-2009112317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175056","id":2009112317,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM853wJ79","user":{"login":"jellizaveta","id":91964807,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXtFhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91964807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta","html_url":"https://github.com/jellizaveta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-20T09:27:14Z","updated_at":"2024-03-20T09:27:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updated rules.

happened after you sent me an email, promoting the \"Ad Guard Browser Assistant v1.4”!!!\r\n> \r\n> This might be connected to my problem.\r\n> \r\n> On my AdGuard app it says that, even though it is enables, it did ZERO BLOCKING etc. - which was until yesterday some gigabytes of blockage!!! All of a sudden these values are ZERO!!!\r\n> \r\n> So PLEASE help me to fix this SNAFU. I can’t work on a phone when those darn adds are not being blocked!\r\n> \r\n> My inquiry number is #885436\r\n> \r\n> Thank you!\r\n> \r\n> Best\r\n> Nick\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/7i4hvfbvoc8wgsw4g8wsswocgww0gw0f50sctq6pls.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ggyqb3mudgoosw8w0048osc4k0o4ss8tg79a65kjdc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.2\r\nSystem version: | Apple i OS 17.4 \r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/175280/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-20T13:01:12Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
