Comment\r\nUsername: @Sulfuric-Acid1024\r\n> 1. The issue here is that a video could not be properly loaded.<br>\r\n> \r\n> 2. The URL mentioned could only be accessed using an authorized account, so the developers might not be able to access it directly.<br>\r\n> \r\n> 3. The website is ran by Tencent Techology in Chinese, thus some translation might be required for the screenshots to be viewed.<br>\r\n> \r\n> 4. The Adblock filtering log has, strangely, recorded nothing being blocked when the problem had first appeared. Further testing, however, has shown the following URL being blocked occationally:<br>\r\n> \r\n>     https://stats.g.doubleclick.net/j/collect?t=dc&aip=1&_r=3&v=1&_v=j100&tid=UA-205111495-1&cid=1399828849.1671240572&jid=61975550&gjid=784782184&_gid=1611883974.1684501134&_u=QACAAEAAAAAAACAAI~&z=2074651821<br>\r\n> \r\n> according to 'AdGuard Base Filter'. This may or may not contribute to the video loading problem.<br>\r\n> \r\n> 5.

The issue here is that a video could not be properly loaded.<br>\r\n> \r\n> 2. The URL mentioned could only be accessed using an authorized account, so the developers might not be able to access it directly.<br>\r\n> \r\n> 3. The website is ran by Tencent Techology in Chinese, thus some translation might be required for the screenshots to be viewed.<br>\r\n> \r\n> 4. The Adblock filtering log has, strangely, recorded nothing being blocked when the problem had first appeared. Further testing, however, has shown the following URL being blocked occationally:<br>\r\n> \r\n>     https://stats.g.doubleclick.net/j/collect?t=dc&aip=1&_r=3&v=1&_v=j100&tid=UA-205111495-1&cid=1399828849.1671240572&jid=61975550&gjid=784782184&_gid=1611883974.1684501134&_u=QACAAEAAAAAAACAAI~&z=2074651821<br>\r\n> \r\n> according to 'AdGuard Base Filter'.
