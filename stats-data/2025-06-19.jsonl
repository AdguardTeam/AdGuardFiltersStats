Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [https://m.facebook.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> When scrolling down or up the feed on Facebook mobile page (m.facebook.com), at some point when you have scrolled enough, posts start \"jumping\".\r\n> \r\n> In practice, I get scrolled back to previous post. This doesn't happen on each post, but at some point it starts to happen quite frequently.\r\n> \r\n> This can't be presented via screenshots, but in those screenshots I've already scrolled past the post that has a blonde woman on it and the fishing post is now appearing. From that point, when I scroll forward, I get thrown back so that the fishing post disappears and I see the post that was before the post with a blonde woman.\r\n> \r\n> Looking at the DOM at the same time when scrolling and this issue appears, I see that an ad post that was hid earlier, gets its \"displayed\" class removed from it. And if I scroll to the other direction, it gets added back (and I jump back to my previous location at the feed). I think that Facebook still manipulates those already hidden ad elements, which causes me to jump into wrong place at the Feed.\r\n> \r\n> If I remove those hidden ad posts (the whole node) this issue doesn't appear.\r\n> \r\n> \"displayed\" class already gets removed and added back to regular posts when scrolling up and down but that doesn't cause issues.

on Facebook mobile page (m.facebook.com), at some point when you have scrolled enough, posts start \"jumping\".\r\n> \r\n> In practice, I get scrolled back to previous post. This doesn't happen on each post, but at some point it starts to happen quite frequently.\r\n> \r\n> This can't be presented via screenshots, but in those screenshots I've already scrolled past the post that has a blonde woman on it and the fishing post is now appearing. From that point, when I scroll forward, I get thrown back so that the fishing post disappears and I see the post that was before the post with a blonde woman.\r\n> \r\n> Looking at the DOM at the same time when scrolling and this issue appears, I see that an ad post that was hid earlier, gets its \"displayed\" class removed from it. And if I scroll to the other direction, it gets added back (and I jump back to my previous location at the feed). I think that Facebook still manipulates those already hidden ad elements, which causes me to jump into wrong place at the Feed.\r\n> \r\n> If I remove those hidden ad posts (the whole node) this issue doesn't appear.\r\n> \r\n> \"displayed\" class already gets removed and added back to regular posts when scrolling up and down but that doesn't cause issues. Only when that class is removed or added back to an already hidden ad element.\r\nUsername: `@peace2000`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/4h8rhrz5xl6oo040gkssc8ckgkgkgkoyxmtckwwz7k.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tfkgqq9fk9w4wo844s4owsowcs08k8kgw9cvqss4nc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/aoszpmklpc00www48ogw0440cc0kw8cojeldy1mz1c.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3vfj3bpl63s48ksw408s04g8gc0cgo4q5lx2f1g5uo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.94 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Adblock List for Finland\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/207603/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-06-19T03:14:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

From that point, when I scroll forward, I get thrown back so that the fishing post disappears and I see the post that was before the post with a blonde woman.\r\n> \r\n> Looking at the DOM at the same time when scrolling and this issue appears, I see that an ad post that was hid earlier, gets its \"displayed\" class removed from it. And if I scroll to the other direction, it gets added back (and I jump back to my previous location at the feed).

filters are being detected by TierMaker, triggering a full‑screen popup (implemented as a div with the ID \"fEy1Z2XT\") that completely blocks access to the site until AdGuard is disabled or TierMaker is whitelisted. Additionally, the volume and intrusiveness of advertisements on TierMaker are highly disruptive.
