Disabling Ad blocking, privacy, internet security and extension does not fix the issue. I have to disable AdGuard for Windows entirely to make it work.\r\n> Remembered from a similar issue with `ebay.com` I have tested provided filters and only the combination of `@@||dell.com^$jsinject,elemhide,extension` does fix the issue.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/NyTSuib.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/GI1mWm6.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/S2z0lAz.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.12\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Disable cache for third-party requests\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS Non-filtering`<br>filters: `AdGuard Home with AdGuard DNS filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142773/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1427549970","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142773#issuecomment-1427549970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142773","id":1427549970,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85VFq8S","user":{"login":"Morku","id":6276915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzY5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6276915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku","html_url":"https://github.com/Morku","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-13T08:42:44Z","updated_at":"2023-02-13T08:42:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@AdamWr \r\n<details><summary>Screenshot-1:</summary>\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6276915/218410672-541f5ce7-5157-4323-bec5-7f1945fb86f7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n</details><br/>\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1427549970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-13T08:42:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Disabling Ad blocking, privacy, internet security and extension does not fix the issue. I have to disable AdGuard for Windows entirely to make it work.\r\n> Remembered from a similar issue with `ebay.com` I have tested provided filters and only the combination of `@@||dell.com^$jsinject,elemhide,extension` does fix the issue.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/NyTSuib.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/GI1mWm6.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/S2z0lAz.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.12\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Disable cache for third-party requests\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS Non-filtering`<br>filters: `AdGuard Home with AdGuard DNS filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142773/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1427544989","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142773#issuecomment-1427544989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142773","id":1427544989,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85VFpud","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-13T08:38:01Z","updated_at":"2023-02-13T08:38:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Oh sorry, I meant AdGuard filtering log.\r\nSomething like this:\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29142494/218409697-a5cca75e-2a71-4ee6-a55f-271ed598cd08.png)\r\n\r\n</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1427544989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-13T08:38:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
