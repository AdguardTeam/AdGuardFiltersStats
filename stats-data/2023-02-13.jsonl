Disabling Ad blocking, privacy, internet security and extension does not fix the issue. I have to disable AdGuard for Windows entirely to make it work.\r\n> Remembered from a similar issue with `ebay.com` I have tested provided filters and only the combination of `@@||dell.com^$jsinject,elemhide,extension` does fix the issue.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/NyTSuib.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/GI1mWm6.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/S2z0lAz.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.12\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Disable cache for third-party requests\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS Non-filtering`<br>filters: `AdGuard Home with AdGuard DNS filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142773/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1427549970","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142773#issuecomment-1427549970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142773","id":1427549970,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85VFq8S","user":{"login":"Morku","id":6276915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzY5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6276915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku","html_url":"https://github.com/Morku","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morku/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-13T08:42:44Z","updated_at":"2023-02-13T08:42:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@AdamWr \r\n<details><summary>Screenshot-1:</summary>\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6276915/218410672-541f5ce7-5157-4323-bec5-7f1945fb86f7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n</details><br/>\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1427549970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-13T08:42:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Disabling Ad blocking, privacy, internet security and extension does not fix the issue.

@markandrewfrey\r\n> With Adguard on, when you come to where there would be an ad, the screen goes blank and you can't scroll past that point. Or as you scroll it just keeps jumping back to before where the ad would be and again you can't scroll further down the page. In other words, with Adguard on, you can only view the first several posts before the page just doesn't work anymore. This happens on my Chromebook and on my Windows PC both using the Chrome browser. On Android, while viewing Instagram in the Chrome browser (not the app), Adguard still works perfectly.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/4zwQplA.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/4JRI43E.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>YousList","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142724/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1427974530","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142724#issuecomment-1427974530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/142724","id":1427974530,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85VHSmC","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-13T13:51:28Z","updated_at":"2023-02-13T13:51:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Unfortunately, I cannot reproduce it.\r\n\r\n@AdguardTeam/filters-maintainers Could you please take a look?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1427974530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-13T13:51:28Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://www.instagram.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\nUsername: @markandrewfrey\r\n> With Adguard on, when you come to where there would be an ad, the screen goes blank and you can't scroll past that point.

@markandrewfrey\r\n> With Adguard on, when you come to where there would be an ad, the screen goes blank and you can't scroll past that point. Or as you scroll it just keeps jumping back to before where the ad would be and again you can't scroll further down the page. In other words, with Adguard on, you can only view the first several posts before the page just doesn't work anymore. This happens on my Chromebook and on my Windows PC both using the Chrome browser.
