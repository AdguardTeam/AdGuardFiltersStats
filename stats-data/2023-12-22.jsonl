extension enabled with default settings, I cannot get to the Spectrum \"Sign In\" page!\r\n> With AdGuard extension enable and with Blocking disabled, I still could not access the \"Sign In\" page!\r\n> After trial and error, I found that the filter called \"Hide Referrer from third parties\" is blocking my access to the Spectrum \"Sign In\" page which also is on a URL starting with \"id.spectrum.net\".\r\n> In conclusion, just by disabling the filter \"Hide Referrer from third parties\" will allow me access to the \"Sign In\" page, however, putting my browsing/surfing the web in
