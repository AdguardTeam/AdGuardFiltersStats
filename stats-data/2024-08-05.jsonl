Comment\r\n> Hello there!\r\n> \r\n> When using dns.adguard.com as Private DNS on Android, the domain trendpick.shopping.naver.com (TrendPick) is inaccessible from multiple browsers including Samsung Internet and Chrome. This domain is part of Naver Shopping, a major South Korean shopping platform (shopping.naver.com).\r\n> \r\n> This is particularly concerning because TrendPick links appear on the main page of shopping.naver.com for logged-in users. Even though the links are marked as \"AD\" (See the second screenshot in AdGuard Disabled), many users often don't notice this and might end up thinking their error page encounter is due to a network or browser issue, rather than AdGuard DNS.\r\n> \r\n> Could you take a look into this and consider allowlisting trendpick.shopping.naver.com if possible?
