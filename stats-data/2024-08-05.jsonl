Comment\r\n> Hello there!\r\n> \r\n> When using dns.adguard.com as Private DNS on Android, the domain trendpick.shopping.naver.com (TrendPick) is inaccessible from multiple browsers including Samsung Internet and Chrome. This domain is part of Naver Shopping, a major South Korean shopping platform (shopping.naver.com).\r\n> \r\n> This is particularly concerning because TrendPick links appear on the main page of shopping.naver.com for logged-in users. Even though the links are marked as \"AD\" (See the second screenshot in AdGuard Disabled), many users often don't notice this and might end up thinking their error page encounter is due to a network or browser issue, rather than AdGuard DNS.\r\n> \r\n> Could you take a look into this and consider allowlisting trendpick.shopping.naver.com if possible?

Comment\r\n> Hello there!\r\n> \r\n> When using dns.adguard.com as Private DNS on Android, the domain trendpick.shopping.naver.com (TrendPick) is inaccessible from multiple browsers including Samsung Internet and Chrome. This domain is part of Naver Shopping, a major South Korean shopping platform (shopping.naver.com).\r\n> \r\n> This is particularly concerning because TrendPick links appear on the main page of shopping.naver.com for logged-in users. Even though the links are marked as \"AD\" (See the second screenshot in AdGuard Disabled), many users often don't notice this and might end up thinking their error page encounter is due to a network or browser issue, rather than AdGuard DNS.\r\n> \r\n> Could you take a look into this and consider allowlisting trendpick.shopping.naver.com if possible?

This is what I showed in SShot 2 in the comment above. The small circle I showed in Sshot 1 is the marking for the title given to successful sellers. Since it is not on every seller, you can see that mark for example on the product in the link below, on some sellers in the \"Other sellers\" section at the bottom. I have marked it in sshot3, which I have just thrown.
