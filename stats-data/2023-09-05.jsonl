And it stops YouTube from working at all, either saying I'm offline (when I'm not) or just showing the spinning wheel of death when you hit play - i.e. trying to play, but not playing.  The only way to fix it is turn off Adguard, reload the page and then turn Adguard back on.  This will get it to play WITH ads, not WITHOUT. It's hopeless.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/h3gb51z4z5kwg08884ckgokw8884oscf74wyymrf2o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/eel40bjamnwcockc44cc040cowcooksd92s5ehiy3w.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.14\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1705778426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-05T00:02:13Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Seems a big bug and still not fixed.\r\n> Forgets everything. You can add them many times and still they don't work! Preview shows the items are removed, but refresh or load another page from the website and they are back! \r\n> \r\n> This extension stops working, you can by disable and enable this extension let it work back again.\r\n> But is some times, this cannot work and Firefox can be slow, not responding. Even crashing or closing itself.\r\n> If this extension stopped working again, then this extension setting page become bugged and not longer working, just white or broke page.\r\n> \r\n> Default settings and rules don't work, always forget something. Which you must add by myself. \r\n> Bad things get allowed instead of blocked. \r\n> This extension doesn't block third-party sites by default, the most annoying and not trustful things. \r\n> \r\n> Websites like Google or using Google things don't work or missing some things. \r\n> Menus and navigation seems not always working, with delay or bugged.\r\n> Submitting forms do not work, the button to send is bugged, not working.\r\n> \r\n> Cannot see content in the log viewer without refreshing first. This don't work well on news sites.\r\n> -Wrong media type in list. Says it is media, but add $media to filter and still this doesn't work. Same for (Java)script.\r\n> -Some sites have a fast hidden refresh or like this, removing a blocked item very fast.\r\n> -Cannot select multiple lines to make filters.\r\n> -Must double click to show filter and then add your filter, back to that window and close it, before your added filter can be used. Unknown why they change this, form just 1 window. Stupid choices.\r\n> -Only options to add website, important, third-party, but no types (script, image, stylesheet, font, media,  ping, csp, ...) to select here.  Also it has examples form the URL, from full to just domain.\r\n> \r\n> Websites keep saying to disable adblocker. Some of them don't load or show their content.\r\n> \r\n> Websites keep saying to accept cookies. \r\n> -Floating and following messages. \r\n> -Popup windows and messages. \r\n> -Banners, promos, counters. \r\n> -Never ending site pages. \r\n> -Other annoying things, items, buttons. \r\n> \r\n> Button to disable/enabled this extension, in the front, disappears many times.\r\n> \r\n> You can add these filter many times, preview shows they are hidden / removed. But refresh or  visit another page and they are back. These filters or forgotten, seems not saved...  Clearly a big bug.\r\n> \r\n> Preview window doesn't show or become bugged, with most options gone. Slide can disappear. Just a white popup window. No buttons to add the filers and do other actions.\r\n> \r\n> Firefox seems to be slower and using more memory, said Windows and repeated (error) message must be closed. Big bug!\r\n> \r\n> Social garbage and other like stuff. Who I did not ask for. Even with filters added, I keep seeing them. \r\n> \r\n> Disabling or enabling this extension with slides / buttons in the front don't work. Keep a website for not working or bugged.\r\n> Sometimes must disable this extension in the Firefox Extensions, to let a website work (continue loading, showing pictures, login, able to  click and actions will be done , showing menus, forms, showing some (hidden)  items and parts that fold out). Or must even uninstall this extension to fix a not working or bugged website.\r\n> \r\n> Cannot change lange in settings for extension. Language is same as Firefox, if supported. Bugs can happen due poor choice to support a language.

Even I don't have / need a picture to add.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Any of the problems above. \r\n> This extension stops working after some time. Unknown why.  Seems a big bug and still not fixed.\r\n> Forgets everything. You can add them many times and still they don't work! Preview shows the items are removed, but refresh or load another page from the website and they are back! \r\n> \r\n> This extension stops working, you can by disable and enable this extension let it work back again.\r\n> But is some times, this cannot work and Firefox can be slow, not responding. Even crashing or closing itself.\r\n> If this extension stopped working again, then this extension setting page become bugged and not longer working, just white or broke page.\r\n> \r\n> Default settings and rules don't work, always forget something. Which you must add by myself. \r\n> Bad things get allowed instead of blocked. \r\n> This extension doesn't block third-party sites by default, the most annoying and not trustful things. \r\n> \r\n> Websites like Google or using Google things don't work or missing some things. \r\n> Menus and navigation seems not always working, with delay or bugged.\r\n> Submitting forms do not work, the button to send is bugged, not working.\r\n> \r\n> Cannot see content in the log viewer without refreshing first. This don't work well on news sites.\r\n> -Wrong media type in list. Says it is media, but add $media to filter and still this doesn't work. Same for (Java)script.\r\n> -Some sites have a fast hidden refresh or like this, removing a blocked item very fast.\r\n> -Cannot select multiple lines to make filters.\r\n> -Must double click to show filter and then add your filter, back to that window and close it, before your added filter can be used. Unknown why they change this, form just 1 window. Stupid choices.\r\n> -Only options to add website, important, third-party, but no types (script, image, stylesheet, font, media,  ping, csp, ...) to select here.  Also it has examples form the URL, from full to just domain.\r\n> \r\n> Websites keep saying to disable adblocker. Some of them don't load or show their content.\r\n> \r\n> Websites keep saying to accept cookies. \r\n> -Floating and following messages. \r\n> -Popup windows and messages. \r\n> -Banners, promos, counters. \r\n> -Never ending site pages. \r\n> -Other annoying things, items, buttons. \r\n> \r\n> Button to disable/enabled this extension, in the front, disappears many times.\r\n> \r\n> You can add these filter many times, preview shows they are hidden / removed. But refresh or  visit another page and they are back. These filters or forgotten, seems not saved...  Clearly a big bug.\r\n> \r\n> Preview window doesn't show or become bugged, with most options gone. Slide can disappear. Just a white popup window. No buttons to add the filers and do other actions.\r\n> \r\n> Firefox seems to be slower and using more memory, said Windows and repeated (error) message must be closed. Big bug!\r\n> \r\n> Social garbage and other like stuff. Who I did not ask for. Even with filters added, I keep seeing them. \r\n> \r\n> Disabling or enabling this extension with slides / buttons in the front don't work. Keep a website for not working or bugged.\r\n> Sometimes must disable this extension in the Firefox Extensions, to let a website work (continue loading, showing pictures, login, able to  click and actions will be done , showing menus, forms, showing some (hidden)  items and parts that fold out). Or must even uninstall this extension to fix a not working or bugged website.\r\n> \r\n> Cannot change lange in settings for extension. Language is same as Firefox, if supported. Bugs can happen due poor choice to support a language.  Unable to select English while working in my language, to give you examples and others stuff for this bug report.\r\n> \r\n> You should check your poor made extension, build it back from zero.\r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/kb63du27ihww8kw4s80c40ksss8g0w42hzxrzrglq0.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Dutch\r\nOther extensions used: | Default.
