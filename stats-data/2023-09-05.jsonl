@Grandpat-Star\r\n> When I try to watch the official music video for Strawberry Wine by Deana Carter Official the adblock has not worked since last night. I have tried reloading and ads show up. When I have tried reloading other videos such as Introducing LEGO Braille Bricks â€“ Play with Braille by Lego official, and the official audio for The Wrong Girl (Greatest Hits Version) by Lee Ann Womack Official the ads are not there. This seems to be contained to this specific video.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ghclp6szi9s0c8woscogs0w80og0ggsds7aguah22o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/tfx68g4v7tw4wkkg0g0s44go0o88sc4dmcps04vezs.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion\r\nOther extensions used: | Duck Duck Go Privacy Essentials, Return Youtube Disklike Button, Youtube-shorts block, CustomTube, and Replace Youtube's Home with Subscriptions","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1705778426","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932#issuecomment-1705778426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/159932","id":1705778426,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85lrBz6","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-05T00:02:12Z","updated_at":"2023-09-05T00:02:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://www.youtube.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Adguard doesn't block ads on YouTube anymore (as of about 2 or 3 days ago).  And it stops YouTube from working at all, either saying I'm offline (when I'm not) or just showing the spinning wheel of death when you hit play - i.e. trying to play, but not playing.  The only way to fix it is turn off Adguard, reload the page and then turn Adguard back on.  This will get it to play WITH ads, not WITHOUT. It's hopeless.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/h3gb51z4z5kwg08884ckgokw8884oscf74wyymrf2o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/eel40bjamnwcockc44cc040cowcooksd92s5ehiy3w.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.14\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nOther extensions used: | None","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1705778426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-05T00:02:13Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
