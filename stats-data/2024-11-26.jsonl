Maybe I didn't explain the situation in the comment section of the previous report clearly.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I am not using AdGuard, but uBlock Origin. uBlock Origin has its own base filter list, but the regional/language-specific filter lists are taken from AdGuard.\r\n\r\nBing has a China-specific version ([https://cn.bing.com]()), which may redirect you to the main site if you are not accessing with a China IP. I think it is a better idea to put the related rules into the Chinese specific list.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese specific list does have rules related to the China-specific Bing. However, it seems that Bing updated its layout a few days ago, so the existing rules are no longer in effect.\r\n\r\nI have investigated the new layout and proposed the following rule, hoping that it could be added to the AdGuard Chinese filter list:\r\n```\r\ncn.bing.com##li.b_algo:has(p:matches-attr(\"class\"=/b_algoSlug/))\r\n```\r\n\r\n@Alex-302 In my screenshot, the little \"广告\" in the search results means \"Advertisement\". I am searching for the regulations on hazardous chemical reagents, but those search results instigate me to buying those reagents on some arbitrary websites. So they are ads definitely.\r\n\r\nThe previous report was submitted using the automatic tool, so my intention may not be that clear.
