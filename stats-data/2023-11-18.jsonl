The ad bock seems to deactivate itself. I put on the automatic start when restart of the phone already. It did not help. I would even pay the premium version, but the protection is not allowed to ever stop. Only I put it manually of course.\r\n> I mean the switch at the beginning of your app, is sometimes deactivated, without me deactivating it. This must change.
