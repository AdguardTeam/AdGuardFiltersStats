So I spent the next hour filtering out suspicious entries in the filtering log & one by one added them as rules, each time clearing out the cache & reopening the app every single time.\n\nAt the best in few earlier attempts only blank white box was visible so kept going further adding new rules. Finally now a black banner inside the white box is visible that hasn't changed ( see screenshot). \n\nTo conclude Ad box is still visible. Below are al the extra rules I have added. Terabox app itself is working fine.\n\n- ||terabox.com/api^$app=com.dubox.drive\n- ||terabox.apse.svr.rixengine.com^$app=com.dubox.drive\n- ||v-jp.nephobox.com^$app=com.dubox.drive\n- ||dns://terabox.apse.svr.rixengine.com^\n- ||global-staticplat.cdn.bcebos.com^$app=com.dubox.drive\n\n![Screenshot_20230401-132446.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52345784/229337660-6c8a2c65-c09a-4df1-b810-527cc7ff519a.png)\n\n    @Alex-302  Latest update\nAdded remaining all entries from filter log as rules one by one.
