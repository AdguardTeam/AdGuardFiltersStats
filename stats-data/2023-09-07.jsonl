Therefore, it is not possible to sign in to Quizlet with AdGuard turned on. With AdGuard turned off, the sign in page loads quickly as a overlay that obscures whatever page was behind it. The cookie prompt also comes back, but that is not essential for sign in to work.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/bcg90y43f7wo80sk0s4k0occow4g0s8j9dv5uw5wl4.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/few46g4f2m80880w44kkw044k04k8845kbdbo6jpyg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.57\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Persian Blocker, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters</details>\r\nOther extensions used: | AVG Antivirus","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/161048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/161048/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-07T01:48:05Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
