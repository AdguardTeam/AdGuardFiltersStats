I search or view products on rakuten,the site doesn't respond or often crashes and takes longer to display products.\r\n> \r\n> I tried to find out how to reproduce crashing website and noticed that it might be easier to reproduce by using Private Browsing(safari) in my end.\r\n> \r\n> I reported this issue to support adguard and got advice that try to reinstall adguard. After doing that this issue occurred again so I recorded videos that shows this issue. Please check the videos if you feel like it.\r\n> I don't know how to share  videos when I report issues,so I uploaded them to google drive.\r\n> Video1 shows when adguard disabled and Video2 shows adguard enabled.
