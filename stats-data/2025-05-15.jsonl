I search or view products on rakuten,the site doesn't respond or often crashes and takes longer to display products.\r\n> \r\n> I tried to find out how to reproduce crashing website and noticed that it might be easier to reproduce by using Private Browsing(safari) in my end.\r\n> \r\n> I reported this issue to support adguard and got advice that try to reinstall adguard. After doing that this issue occurred again so I recorded videos that shows this issue. Please check the videos if you feel like it.\r\n> I don't know how to share  videos when I report issues,so I uploaded them to google drive.\r\n> Video1 shows when adguard disabled and Video2 shows adguard enabled.

Comment\r\n> When visiting websites like 1337x.to, I encounter a persistent issue where clicking anywhere on the page triggers an unwanted pop-up or redirects me to another site. Sometimes, these redirects attempt to download malware or force interactions with deceptive pages. This behaviour makes interacting with the intended website impossible without triggering these unwanted actions.\r\n> \r\n> Steps to Reproduce:\r\n> - Open AdGuard with filtering enabled.\r\n> - Navigate to 1337x.to or similar torrent-related websites.\r\n> - Attempt to click on any part of the page.\r\n> - Observe that a new tab or pop-up appears, sometimes prompting a malware download.\r\n> \r\n> Expected Behaviour:\r\n> AdGuard should block these intrusive pop-ups and prevent malicious redirects.\r\n> \r\n> Actual Behavior:\r\n> The page takeover occurs despite AdGuard being active, allowing unwanted pop-ups and redirects.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/a0ndlrlcf4g8sckscogkk04w80gk80ckehnspk36cg.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System

Comment\r\n> When visiting websites like 1337x.to, I encounter a persistent issue where clicking anywhere on the page triggers an unwanted pop-up or redirects me to another site. Sometimes, these redirects attempt to download malware or force interactions with deceptive pages. This behaviour makes interacting with the intended website impossible without triggering these unwanted actions.\r\n> \r\n> Steps to Reproduce:\r\n> - Open AdGuard with filtering enabled.\r\n> - Navigate to 1337x.to or similar torrent-related websites.\r\n> - Attempt to click on any part of the page.\r\n> - Observe that a new tab or pop-up appears, sometimes prompting a malware download.\r\n> \r\n> Expected Behaviour:\r\n> AdGuard should block these intrusive pop-ups and prevent malicious redirects.\r\n> \r\n> Actual Behavior:\r\n> The page takeover occurs despite AdGuard being active, allowing unwanted pop-ups and redirects.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/a0ndlrlcf4g8sckscogkk04w80gk80ckehnspk36cg.png?nc=1)\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.20.3 (4994)\r\nSystem version: | Edition\tWindows 11 Pro Version\t24H2 Installed on\t‎2025-‎03-‎28 OS build\t26100.3915 Experience\tWindows Feature Experience Pack 1000.26100.83.0\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nTracking protection: | **General settings**:<br>Block trackers, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header<br><br>**Tracking methods**:<br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests<br><br>**Browser API**:<br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API<br><br>**Windows tracking**:<br>Disable Windows Telemetry, <br>Turn off Advertising ID, <br>Disable Windows Defender automatic samples submission, <br>Disable WAP Push Message Routing Service<br><br>**Miscellaneous**:<br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Protect against DPI\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://d.adguard-dns.com/dns-query/xxxxxxx`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`, `User rules (url: none)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List\r\nCustom filters: | User rules (url: none)\r\nBrowsing Security: | enabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | enabled\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)<br>AdGuard Popup Blocker (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js)\r\nUserstyles: | disabled\r\n\r\n### Issue configuration\r\n[Import](https://reports.adguard.com/settings/import.html?adblocking.enabled=true&browsing_security.enabled=true&browsing_security.statistics_enabled=true&custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.custom_bootstrap=&dns.custom_fallback=&dns.custom_filters=User%2520rules%2520%28url%3A%2520none%29&dns.enabled=true&dns.fallback_mode=System&dns.filters=1&dns.servers=https%3A%2F%2Fd.adguard-dns.com%2Fdns-query%2Fxxxxxxx&dns.timeout=0&extensions=AdGuard%2520Extra%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fadguard-extra%2F1.0%2Fadguard-extra.user.js%29%2CAdGuard%2520Popup%2520Blocker%2520%28script%3B%2520url%3A%2520https%3A%2F%2Fuserscripts.adtidy.org%2Frelease%2Fpopup-blocker%2F2.5%2Fpopupblocker.user.js%29&extensions.enabled=true&filters=2.3.4.11.17.18.19.20.21.22.207&license_type=paid&product_type=Win&product_version=7.20.3+%284994%29&referrer=&scheme_version=2&stealth.DNT=true&stealth.block_third_party_auth=false&stealth.block_trackers=true&stealth.disable_third_party_cache=true&stealth.disable_wap_push_message_routing_service=true&stealth.disable_windows_defender=true&stealth.disable_windows_telemetry=true&stealth.dpi=true&stealth.enabled=true&stealth.flash=false&stealth.hide_search_queries=true&stealth.java=false&stealth.location=false&stealth.push=true&stealth.strip_url=true&stealth.third_party_cookies=180&stealth.turn_off_advertising_id=true&stealth.webrtc=true&stealth.x_client=true&system_version=Microsoft+Windows+NT+10.0.26100.0&user_agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F136.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36+Edg%2F136.0.0.0&win.wfp=true)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205302/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-15T10:27:06Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [https://vipbox.to/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvipbox.to%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Please check the possibility that the domain `advsmedia.xyz` is functioning primarily as an ad-serving intermediary. It wraps actual stream links for example like:\r\n> \r\n> `javascript:void(window.open('https://advsmedia.xyz/live/?t=Flash&link=https://wikisport.best/embed/bt1.php&id=357889&w=https://vipbox.to/%27,%27ddd%27,%27width=1000,height=900%27))`\r\n> \r\n> The stream appears to be hosted at `https://wikisport.best/embed/bt1.php`, but it is embedded through advsmedia.xyz, which adds advertising and possibly controls navigation between streams. It may be worth checking whether the ads can be separated from the functional streaming component.\r\n> \r\n> Also similar websites:\r\n> \r\n> `https://streamsports.to/`\r\n> `https://streameast.plus/`\r\n> `https://fromsport.online/`\r\n> `https://pirlotv.site/`\r\n> `https://hesgoal.games/`\r\n> `https://score808.fyi/`\r\n> `https://score808.my/`\r\n> `https://live-tv.show/`\r\n> `https://score808.watch/`\r\n> `https://808score.pro/`\r\n> `https://sportlemon.site/`\r\n> `https://jokerstreams.tv/`\r\n> `https://soccerstreams.soccer/`\r\n> `https://vipbox.watch/`\r\n> `https://sportshub.watch/`\r\n> `https://lemonsport.live/`\r\n> `https://sportplus.ws/`\r\n> `https://footybite.soccer/`\r\n> `https://footybite.me/`\r\n> `https://batmanstream.watch/`\r\n> `https://jokerlivestream.co/`\r\n> `https://sportstream.one/`\r\n> `https://sport-plus.live/`\r\n> `https://jokerlive.stream/`\r\n> `https://buffstreams.vip/`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ho42amemg5k4w4oww8k8s4sgw40csc4dauf6hm1i0g.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ew5c4ci39jk8wow0okcw0c8ck8kscselm3164i0mos.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser Extension v5.1.79 MV2\r\nSystem version: | Windows 10\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2883312497","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204863#issuecomment-2883312497","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/204863","id":2883312497,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86r29tx","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-15T10:19:52Z","updated_at":"2025-05-15T10:19:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Sergey-Lyapin ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2883312497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-15T10:19:54Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I search or view products on rakuten,the site doesn't respond or often crashes and takes longer to display products.\r\n> \r\n> I tried to find out how to reproduce crashing website and noticed that it might be easier to reproduce by using Private Browsing(safari) in my end.\r\n> \r\n> I reported this issue to support adguard and got advice that try to reinstall adguard.

it might be easier to reproduce by using Private Browsing(safari) in my end.\r\n> \r\n> I reported this issue to support adguard and got advice that try to reinstall adguard. After doing that this issue occurred again so I recorded videos that shows this issue. Please check the videos if you feel like it.\r\n> I don't know how to share  videos when I report issues,so I uploaded them to google drive.\r\n> Video1 shows when adguard disabled and Video2 shows adguard enabled. I did the same operation in scrolling as possible.\r\n> \r\n> Video1 url:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SZGyIWTBP8F3f-cCFUHxLHWuhygHCGTi/view?usp=drivesdk\r\n> \r\n> Video2 url: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kkjTneV3Y5dA9L117GTCagsYzwz9iQFv/view?usp=drivesdk\r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/hnnynwq981s0sosoc0gk8004cw0gsswhtxwb3oq1vk.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/82twtsn80hgcs00g88c084o84skw000pcci2doqwuo.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for iOS v4.5.10\r\nSystem version: | ios18.5\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nAdvanced protection: | enabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>EasyList Cookie List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205261/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2883912151","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205261#issuecomment-2883912151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/205261","id":2883912151,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86r5QHX","user":{"login":"ePay4100","id":211520263,"node_id":"U_kgDODJuLBw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/211520263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ePay4100","html_url":"https://github.com/ePay4100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ePay4100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ePay4100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ePay4100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ePay4100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ePay4100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ePay4100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ePay4100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ePay4100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ePay4100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-15T13:56:51Z","updated_at":"2025-05-15T13:56:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I could not accumulate the same rules number, but page reloading or crashing occured again.\nAlso,when advanced protection is off the website performs as usual.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f101c745-1f45-4dbb-a87f-e5487426affb)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2883912151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2025-05-15T14:03:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

After the countdown, you’ll arrive at the page `adshield.chiheisen.news/verify/`, where the ad-blocker detection message appears.\r\n> \r\n> I tested this with uBlock Origin’s default configuration and saw the same behavior.

If you are using Node.js scripts as tasks, you might need to explicitly run them with <code>node</code>, especially when using Windows:</p>\n<pre lang=\"json\"><code>{\n  &quot;*.js&quot;: &quot;node my-js-linter.js&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/pull/1546\">#1546</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/commit/158d15c9aea0a3a87790ec3766442763cf387dba\"><code>158d15c</code></a> Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/iiroj\"><code>@​iiroj</code></a>! - The <code>--shell</code> flag has been removed and <em>lint-staged</em> no longer supports evaluating commands directly via a shell. To migrate existing commands, you can create a shell script and invoke it instead. Lint-staged will pass matched staged files as a list of arguments, accessible via <code>&quot;$@&quot;</code>:</p>\n<pre lang=\"shell\"><code># my-script.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n<p>echo &quot;Staged files: $@&quot;<br />\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>and</p>\n<pre lang=\"json\"><code>{ &quot;*.js&quot;: &quot;my-script.sh&quot; }\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you were using the shell option to avoid passing filenames to tasks, for example <code>bash -c 'tsc --noEmit'</code>, use the function syntax instead:</p>\n<pre lang=\"js\"><code>export default { '*.ts': () =&gt; 'tsc --noEmit' }\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/pull/1546\">#1546</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/commit/158d15c9aea0a3a87790ec3766442763cf387dba\"><code>158d15c</code></a> Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/iiroj\"><code>@​iiroj</code></a>! - Validation for deprecated advanced configuration has been removed.

If you are using Node.js scripts as tasks, you might need to explicitly run them with <code>node</code>, especially when using Windows:</p>\n<pre lang=\"json\"><code>{\n  &quot;*.js&quot;: &quot;node my-js-linter.js&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/pull/1546\">#1546</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/commit/158d15c9aea0a3a87790ec3766442763cf387dba\"><code>158d15c</code></a> Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/iiroj\"><code>@​iiroj</code></a>! - The <code>--shell</code> flag has been removed and <em>lint-staged</em> no longer supports evaluating commands directly via a shell.

Could you please guide me on whether it's possible with AdGuard, and if so, what specific settings or filters I should enable?
