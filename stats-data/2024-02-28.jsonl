They can be found by the regexp:\r\n`#%#AG_onLoad.*\\.click\\(`\r\nThey must be replaced by [trusted-click-element](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/Scriptlets/blob/master/wiki/about-trusted-scriptlets.md#-%EF%B8%8F-trusted-click-element) scriptlet rules.\r\n\r\nThe most rules can be converted to one rule. If converted  into more than one rule - make groups for the sites in corresponding files as usual.\r\nThere are many old rules, so first you need to check if the site is available, and then the need for the rule.\r\n\r\n* For convenience, you can work in a separate browser\r\n* Retrieve the list of domains, clean up duplicates and check if sites exist (if redirects occur, we assume that the site is dead).\r\n* All such rules can be merged into one file, convert them to exception rules and import as custom filter. Then go down the list and check if the rules are needed (other types of problems not related to these rules are skipped).\r\n* If the site is dead - add domains in the comment below. Then we will remove them from the filters.\r\n\r\nIn order not to overlap with other filter maintainers, it is desirable to perform batch rule replacement via pull-requests (5-10 rules per PR).\r\n\r\n### Important\r\nIt should be checked with a Dutch or German VPN, because otherwise the cookie usage messages may not
