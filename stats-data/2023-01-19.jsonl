The image appears in the card.\r\n> \r\n> Every once in a while an image goes through when AdGuard is on (because I forget to turn it off), but it's mostly the first one, then nothing else goes through until I turn AdGuard off. \r\n> Oftentimes I also get an error (from Trello on their website) that I am not connected to the server. Everything (creating cards, changing text etc) continues to work except for the image upload, and once AdGuard is off there are no more server error messages on the Trello site either. \r\n> Note that all my Trello pages are affected by this issue, not just the \"Rezepte\" one from the screenshots.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/27u9kQt.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9IRBpWq.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.53\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Germany\r\nOther extensions used: | Extensions: 1Password Beta, AdGuard AdBlocker, Download Manager (S3), Evernote Web Clipper, Nervenschoner (Adblocker, but I disabled that and the issue persists), Perfect Home, Save to Pocket (mini), The Camelizer // Anti-virus: Bitdefender Antivirus Free","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/139468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/139468/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1397036343","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/139468#issuecomment-1397036343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/139468","id":1397036343,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85TRRU3","user":{"login":"Scolaro","id":14360631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzYwNjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14360631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scolaro","html_url":"https://github.com/Scolaro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scolaro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scolaro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scolaro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scolaro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scolaro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scolaro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scolaro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scolaro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scolaro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-19T14:08:18Z","updated_at":"2023-01-19T14:08:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Okay, now I even have an instance in which the first (very small) image gets through while the next one (and any subsequent images/files) don't. \r\n![Screenshot 2023-01-19 150313](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14360631/213463303-a00821e6-878c-4858-ba31-940b40959462.jpg)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1397036343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-01-19T14:08:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
