Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://www.amazon.nl/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.nl%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> For some reason, amazon.nl is unusable when adguard is enabled. It feels like the redirections are broken. Installing it with the recommended settings, did not help. Clearing the cookies/caches also did not help. Using a different browser works for some reason.\r\nUsername: `@dgokcin`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/c9uyxu1vrn4sk8wok4cwsw8o4404k0s39y2ezja40o.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/ctu350qhqfsco0owc04wk8g8ok8g0w4a3fif0sj9xc.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3 </summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/jjrd812uaw0gc4s8k8c4s4gk80ksg00tfkvfdgq1cg.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1 with AdGuard disabled</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.adguard.info/sitereports/3xer91j8dgw0ogss84o4gwso044wc44rhuyo7pkjis.png?nc=1)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | Value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.15.1.1731 release\r\nSystem version: | MacOS Sonoma 14.6.1 (23G93)\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nLicense type: | paid\r\nTracking protection: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `system default`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS Filter`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Dutch\r\nBrowsing Security: | disabled\r\nBrowsing Security statistics: | disabled\r\nUserscripts: | disabled\r\nUserstyles: | disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/188608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/188608/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/2345858252","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/188608#issuecomment-2345858252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/188608","id":2345858252,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM86L0vTM","user":{"login":"dgokcin","id":33603535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjAzNTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33603535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgokcin","html_url":"https://github.com/dgokcin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgokcin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgokcin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgokcin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgokcin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgokcin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgokcin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgokcin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgokcin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgokcin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-12T10:21:54Z","updated_at":"2024-09-12T10:21:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I can also not reproduce it now 🙃 .
